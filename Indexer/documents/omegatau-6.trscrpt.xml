  <slot end="0" start="-20">science and technology in your headphones episode 6 of Army guy tall find the College in your headphones best episode is a public that's near</slot>
  <slot end="20" start="0">dear to my heart well somehow most of the episodes are but the other one is related to computing to programming um no one to programming to the essence of what computation about what computer science really about and why are there disciplines outside of computer science</slot>
  <slot end="40" start="20">call to know about these concepts the episode is an interview with the ocean and wings she's a professor at Carnegie Mellon University and Country working for NSF anti she's going to talk about this stuff I got to know her work from optical in the communication at the ACM that's basically a practical of these</slot>
  <slot end="60" start="40">computing machinery and I for interviews with her before a iPod shuffle to have her on the show Angeles kind enough to actually agree to be a guest on the show so thank you for that before we stop at the disco thinking let me just briefly remind you that at the end of the show we have a special treat this time there's some really great</slot>
  <slot end="80" start="60">from a band called parking some of the best music I ever heard so uh to make sure you cash checks at the end of the bottom to the show thank you um so before we get started with a public company thinking of Peace interview South Dallas nursing know where you are I am right now the assistant director for</slot>
  <slot end="100" start="80">computer and information science and engineering at the National Science Foundation I'm on leave from Carnegie Mellon University where I am a professor and I used to be the department head of computer science okay as part of your world at the day</slot>
  <slot end="120" start="100">almond you have done a lot of work on computer thinking so obvious give our listeners you know a 10000 foot over you a lot of thinking it's all about computational thinking is a way of approaching solving problems or designing systems that uses Khan</slot>
  <slot end="140" start="120">septa principles message from computer science anyway to find out the most important of those concepts principles methods that apply your whole idea of decomposing a problem and solving it terms of inventing the relevant accept tra auctions for focusing attention</slot>
  <slot end="160" start="140">what the hell that matter and ignoring the details I don't matter is probably the most important part of computational thinking that is it struction process of section isn't something that specific only to computer science and engineering mathematics science also use a spec shins quite a bit ride most of the time does</slot>
  <slot end="180" start="160">actions are on numerica nature on and one of the things that computer scientist do more routinely is using symbolic obstructions the other thing about the kind of obstruction process computer scientist use is we always work at</slot>
  <slot end="200" start="180">more than one level of trash at the same time so we're always worried about the implementation to assess the cation the friend since if you have a blueprint that's one of a fraction in architecture but when you actually build a house that's</slot>
  <slot end="220" start="200">the realization Northampton the patient of the system in this case the building to the blueprint and so is computer science um we are able to build large complex systems because we can play rar obstruction or we can composer attractions in Utah</slot>
  <slot end="240" start="220">action allows us to focus are attention for instance there an hour this or reasoning about on one of the property or one aspect of the system at a time the other thing about computational thinking of course the automation over abs</slot>
  <slot end="260" start="240">Asians so we often does Justin vent the most beautiful elegant a mathematical abstraction but we worry about the efficiency of executing the abstraction or representing the obstruction and so we are always in the back of our minds thinking this the most def</slot>
  <slot end="280" start="260">should way to solve the problem is the most efficient way to represent the data so that I can. Or analyze it and so computational thinking um I like to say now is about the two a days off traction and automation on the computer</slot>
  <slot end="300" start="280">is just the autumn Asian of our abstraction a systems approach the philosophy of you well so the idea of computer thinking is to teach non computer scientist the ideas and concepts and the use of abstraction to solve problems not just the obstruction. process but the obstruction</slot>
  <slot end="320" start="300">I'm self the algorithms the data structures ways in which one thinks about power station or a concurrent vs distributed systems on the ways in which we have to deal with handling fault so I think they're Ashley from concrete</slot>
  <slot end="340" start="320">get a tional thinking concept if you will that that would actually show me dit use to to the way the scientist and engineers typically I might solve their problems can you maybe provide a concrete example that scientists and engineers can relate to one of my favorite examples right now is</slot>
  <slot end="360" start="340">the grand and Ishan of the geosciences to model the earth the Earth from the inner core to the earth surface to the Sun and what they want to be able to do is model every single physical system the earth involves from atmosphere to the cryosphere the hydrosphere shoes</slot>
  <slot end="380" start="360">even the biosphere let alone all the systems In N Out or space if you're talking about to the Sun or to the deepest um that's off of the earth talking about the inner core any to one of those systems from the computer science point if you would be one system model and what you would want to do is talk</slot>
  <slot end="400" start="380">now the interactions of these different this and you don't want one big model one big monolithic model you actually want um individual models perhaps one persist um um and then you want to talk about the interactions between a system that you might very well mothers interactions terms</slot>
  <slot end="420" start="400">highway of a software system would interact with a different thought though the way your browser might interact with some server that stores your um email or something like that so um we would talk about the AP ID application programming interface interface</slot>
  <slot end="440" start="420">that's making sure you get your interface right so that you don't have to worry about how the system implemented elo that interface alone define abstraction layer which then can be used as the what is the target language for some other system weather of addition of the gym</slot>
  <slot end="460" start="440">this is is that they want to be able to predict climb it on a regional scale in terms of say 10 to 20 years out and they want to be able to do all of this is a multiple of resolutions of time and space out this is a grand edition for the deal signs isn't this is a purse</slot>
  <slot end="480" start="460">example of a kind of computational model they need where you're not going to do it in just one monolithic model you need money to different kinds of attraction to talk about the different resolutions the time and so you want to hire a vehicle model that you can you talk about things that only matter to the query</slot>
  <slot end="500" start="480">hand right Sears were actually see the challenge for the computer scientist to come up with appropriate attractions for this condition of of modeling the earth is certainly not going to be all bunch of different equations Stokes equation that we're going to plug in in America</slot>
  <slot end="520" start="500">hoes in an input values for non and push the button in a track if you will going to be a #### computational attractions that are going to enable us to model set alarm system I'm really trying to say that what computer scientist have</slot>
  <slot end="540" start="520">Bing to the table is a different way of approaching solving a problem Rudy's kind of computational attractions and Minnie the computation instructions RR mathematically very rich there because they're based on baby algebraic structures in and not the standard numeric</slot>
  <slot end="560" start="540">actions that mathematicians engineers use a lawn taking a couple of notes while you explain to the geological example things like interfaces muscular isation information hiding I might be a little things to the concept that I know is a computer scientist at that you have mentioned a straight and that's the kind of</slot>
  <slot end="580" start="560">if you want to teach the other engineering and and and and science disciplines that's right okay then let me talk about some of those principles of so that are non computer science listeners have a chance to understand some of those so much is the reservationists I want to the most fundamental once and basically the idea of breaking down</slot>
  <slot end="600" start="580">big into smaller pieces and then reassembling the big one from the small pieces of a complex problem what do you do if you break down complex problem into smaller problems between easier to handle and then use of those easier problems and then from that you re assembled the overall solution um</slot>
  <slot end="620" start="600">very powerful concepts Houston programming all over the place and also used almost everywhere else um fundamental I guess I don't have to explain it any much more will talk about is the interphase interface is basically a contract where the provider of some service and the user all the consumer of service degree on or foe</slot>
  <slot end="640" start="620">specify what that services in how to access it so you go back to the example of the email program I get my email server that provides an interface that you can use to know I'm Oscar the sum of all the available emails for all the new email account to another interphase my baby to dollar</slot>
  <slot end="660" start="640">load all the new emails interphase would be paid to post a new email for it to forward it to some other service Wright's interface is a very important concept because it allows you to ignore from the perspective of a pencil how to interface is implemented what the provider</slot>
  <slot end="680" start="660">actually dust to fulfill the contract you just know how to use the module write a molecule of messenger face um you just know how to use it from a client from consumers perspective you notice a man takes of interphase and then is the responsibility of the service provider to fulfill the interface</slot>
  <slot end="700" start="680">post set alarm for you to consider a model a kind of black box where you know the interphase and not the internals this is the next concert which is information hiding Wichita open a very related if you have a module with an interface and you can use this to hide inside</slot>
  <slot end="720" start="700">and that is important because it allows you to change the module provides the service Dekalb IL interface so um you're able to optimize implementation you can change it you can provide different levels of quality up with the same contact on the contract best 5 quality that is um and then for information hiding</slot>
  <slot end="740" start="720">what kind of the other side of the interphase interface penny 5 how to work with a black box and information hiding basically said that there is a ball bat box which provide a service but you don't care music perspective about how does it information is hidden in Christ and you don't know information</slot>
  <slot end="760" start="740">rely on it which means that the provider all the inside of the module can always change this aspect without invalidating benefits the contract define the concept about it at it 2 map One Direction on to another one of very well known example from computer science and programming do I know that computer space</slot>
  <slot end="780" start="760">parade with the bits zeros in Vons on airline kind of combined to group of bats called bites and then there is a very very low level language inside the computers microprocessor that is basically the language of the microprocessor Mexican thanks I add something into memory touch something from memory</slot>
  <slot end="800" start="780">compare value something like that and umm the programmer when implementing an application to work with that right they work with high level abstractions for example HTML to rent a wreck pages or high level programming languages to express a kind of behavior and the weight does Highland</slot>
  <slot end="820" start="800">directions are executed is that they are map to lower level abstractions so there is basically a translation stop going on at Maps things like HTML another high level programming languages on to the bits and bytes and low level up code the Microsoft account on the stand this happen</slot>
  <slot end="840" start="820">stages in several steps by steps pesadilla mapping for months directions to another set of instructions where the mapping prism semantic identity so if you express something in a high level of attraction I'm the same thing is expressed in a Lola directions to the lower level stop</slot>
  <slot end="860" start="840">is much more stuff to ride rides much more elaborate much more detailed a high-level obstruction has been invented exactly you know to be able to express certain things very concise late and then have a machine translator map it down to the lower level glory implementation with low level obstructions</slot>
  <slot end="880" start="860">the beauty of business that you have a low level side of things that are very very general a very very fine grained but they are very very very Broad Ripple you can do everything with that thing you do invent several different high-level objections to optimize towards certain tasks and then you can use</slot>
  <slot end="900" start="880">directions to express does tossed 3 and then there map down to the love language and you don't have to have you know a microprocessor for each of those high low cost you met them onto the lobster actions of the ability to map does extractions on to each other and thereby also created</slot>
  <slot end="920" start="900">different highlight directions to optimize for different tasks is very very important in a very very useful concept for all kinds of systems nian again I don't want to say that computer scientist have invented the mathematician side is an engineer's uses all the time sometimes they use them without even realize</slot>
  <slot end="940" start="920">singing at sometimes if you get something name all of a sudden it is and powers you camp with this concept that you can use over and over again instance um if I use the term algorithm Amanda explain to a child that when your learning long division is</slot>
  <slot end="960" start="940">hours for figuring out how to get the quotient remainder when you divide one number to another then all of a sudden I can say well in general a step by step procedure that will give you rest I'll get into giving not a man put that child can have this concept</slot>
  <slot end="980" start="960">procedure the ocean of an hour as a step by step procedure to solve a problem um is empowering concept simile with data structures find and Engineers probably in the back of their minds when they're manipulating A Raisin matrices and and numbers really hot</slot>
  <slot end="1000" start="980">find a higher level droptine on a date a structure of you will that have higher level operations that manipulate that data structure and implicit to that are the in very in one tries to maintain I'm off that higher level abstraction the thing</slot>
  <slot end="1020" start="1000">invariant send data structures out of them are kind of bread and butter for computer science and so what I want when I talk about computational thinking I really mean does kind of bread and butter concept not just the high-level motion of using abstraction so you mentioned the child at the learn to divide um</slot>
  <slot end="1040" start="1020">and so this racist question who you want to target on who you think should be more aware of those to tape computational thinking concept is it in children is it engineers is something that should be taught in universities how do you envision making this more prevalent well first of all I go around giving a talk um with my first love</slot>
  <slot end="1060" start="1040">what states my vision for the 21st century and that is computational thinking will it be a skill that everyone in the world the used I truly believe that certainly in the sciences and engineering disciplines we already seeing light ascension ears using computational math</slot>
  <slot end="1080" start="1060">Sid and concept house without knowing it um in order to advance their own science and engineering discipline and this is a given time I think that we're going to see more of it I'm out of the leaders of the stuff that already an ensign energy astronomy the application</slot>
  <slot end="1100" start="1080">science science science who is inevitable that were all the things the influence of computational thinking in the fields outside of Science in Engineering so for instant acting on it is a virgin area where a computer scientist in that economists are working together</slot>
  <slot end="1120" start="1100">we're going to see it in the social sciences when we try to understand complex systems and they try to understand complex systems and we're going to see the Arts and Humanities and easy uses a computational thinking is the application of data mining in statistical machine learning that out loud</slot>
  <slot end="1140" start="1120">other feels discover news fax in their own disciplines because of the use of these analysis techniques but that's the kind of love hanging fruit that every ed with the ability to store um massive amounts of data and the ability to analyze</slot>
  <slot end="1160" start="1140">all that data with these kinds of data mining techniques on is kind of the first easy thing that any discipline can do with respect to research implications I think I really feel this going to be um influenced by computational thinking is not and bracing computational thinking as the neck</slot>
  <slot end="1180" start="1160">paradigm that will advanced around feels that someone as a biased view I know II and I'm not going to be just as good as other pills but I think it's good it's going to be part of the the tool kit the rapper tour of them</slot>
  <slot end="1200" start="1180">ways in which people solving a problem but let me get to your other question which has to do with the target audience I get if you carry my vision to the extreme it really mean thinking about what should we be teaching our children when should we be in</slot>
  <slot end="1220" start="1200">do you think computational thinking house should we be teaching computational think I'd F what should we be teaching us if we want to be teaching computations thinking and you know it Emily my colleagues I hear in the US in in the UK and so on there seems to be the same</slot>
  <slot end="1240" start="1220">Lincoln census that we really have to focus on early great skate 212 events of the cases 6 before I get to that I do want to say that already in the United States and I believe in in other countries in Europe I suppose many many universities and colleges are right</slot>
  <slot end="1260" start="1240">now revisiting undergraduate curricula in computer science especially the introductory course this and then revisiting it in ways that are completely consistent with what I'm promoting what is a its principles of computer science that should be taught at these introductory courses</slot>
  <slot end="1280" start="1260">not just computer programming what everyone is is definitely a green on is at computer science is not just computer programming ride and I think we need to dispel this misperception that prompts the public house or high school teachers have a guidance counselor time on the computer</slot>
  <slot end="1300" start="1280">wises just computer programming we know that it's a computer scientist but the general public not know that now so I'm one of the things that is going on campus is 2 out the United States is revisiting the undergraduate curriculum in computer science in a liter introducing a new car</slot>
  <slot end="1320" start="1300">words that end with a computer science offering it to incoming students or people who are not made the computer but want to learn something about computer science a man might my dream with the that it would be a kind of course that could be added to the general as you climb it says anything</slot>
  <slot end="1340" start="1320">cool are the Philistines distribution for SSI requirements Anacapa this is happening already and the other thing on stopping is at its already having a trickle down effect is a high school teacher heaven the case of 12 level 2 out reach activities that the people are doing the timing</slot>
  <slot end="1360" start="1340">the right because um over the past few years we seen a decline in the Roman to computer science Inn at the undergraduate level and so II must admit that one of my early motivation for writing my little CA salmon was too um take a step</slot>
  <slot end="1380" start="1360">they will what's going on and what can we be doing about this and then the inside is that you can major in computer science and do anything happen if we can only project the proper image of what computer science it is then we can um first of all</slot>
  <slot end="1400" start="1380">how's the traffic for students asking major in computer science and not necessarily have those people go on and Duke graduate degrees computer science benefit from having a good education where they are talk computations thinking because you can use computational thinking in anything after projecting me the</slot>
  <slot end="1420" start="1400">image of what computer science is responding to the general public what is computer science what is computational thinking then has the effect of possibly all hopefully I'm having a high schools revisit their horses so that their teaching in a computer science course</slot>
  <slot end="1440" start="1420">not just computer programming this is a test that level already where parents and students get the wrong idea Computer Sciences m I was thinking about what is now that the kind of awareness of becomes more important then maybe one reason is that in a computer</slot>
  <slot end="1460" start="1440">sand and computation has been or has in French is influencing all kinds of other disciplines in some sense what you're supposed to just thing is that we need to adapt a #### a cation of all those people in those field to the fact that more and more of the work is based on computers in computing you said</slot>
  <slot end="1480" start="1460">beautifully so I wish I said what you just said that I completely agree with you interesting um observation that we should not forget is that the next generation is already adept with the technology they are all lot less you're full of</slot>
  <slot end="1500" start="1480">using computing and computer computational devices that say their parents so we already have their attention and so it what we should be taking is as a field is taking at that stuff to say you know what this is just a device is Ashley from intelligence Napa high this device</slot>
  <slot end="1520" start="1500">and we can you note each how to program the device that would be a weighted to Ashley Tisdale computation contact them under the covers what is the vice actually work now and then start teaching some computational I'm thinking or obstruction concepts by ass</slot>
  <slot end="1540" start="1520">the why am I the house question to challenge with will be to make this a interesting and fun to people while you stay on the conceptual level without having them implementos concepts by programming you know because I mean Hyatt conceptual stop it always someone hop</slot>
  <slot end="1560" start="1540">if you don't give them a tool to play with a bat toolkit be programed kind of white bat well I am NOT a verse to to learning programming I think you can learn programming along the way um but this is Ashley debate for education scientist and this is something that I have been quite</slot>
  <slot end="1580" start="1560">um sensitive to because computer scientist are hardly the people to know how to teach a kid to 12 level yes um and I think it would be African of us to think that we know better however we can definitely be working with education scientist and coming to find</slot>
  <slot end="1600" start="1580">understand how children learn um and end in sight and SS is working with the the National Academies computer size and telecommunications board is holding a series the workshop to address exactly this question which is how should we teach computational syncing to take</slot>
  <slot end="1620" start="1600">1204 a different way to put that is how should children best learn computational thinking on and on on these workshops are deliberately meant to bring together the computer scientist with the education find his and the cops the scientist of the learning sign is in some sense</slot>
  <slot end="1640" start="1620">what for have visited for itself you know it around the Cora and it's what the mathematician have been doing enough room for decades and we do it um but the computer find out about the mysterious way now it's not just you know what we teach 6 graders or what</slot>
  <slot end="1660" start="1640">3rd graders what you want to look at the hollow um progression of how children learn over the years that you know what concept introduce when and how to reinforce does con that's it later braids using different techniques prep for abstract and concrete I take</slot>
  <slot end="1680" start="1660">Navarro for Wii how to have a unique a computer science of a very powerful tool that's the computer an interesting question I know is in parallel with thinking about how to teach and learn the concept along the way to learn skills improve</slot>
  <slot end="1700" start="1680">is how to use the toll most effectively and you can use a toll on the Isley to enhance learning concepts in ways that the other fields don't have um about the other things the dangers of course to deceive yourself into thinking you're learning computational thinking when all you are really</slot>
  <slot end="1720" start="1700">doing is learning how to use the computer buy a low level computer literacy Sense ep um and so that that is on the field that you know if you really want to most effectively teach children a computational thinking we have to think both in terms of what concept</slot>
  <slot end="1740" start="1720">petite when and when to introduce the tool to reinforce burning of concept map okay so direct to stop 2 shop questions 1 is where do people go if they want to learn more about it and the second question is what did I forgot the lock okay so there</slot>
  <slot end="1760" start="1740">already popping up on various websites that some people are made tanning individually I speak ill of it was a conflict of interest here there's a center for computational thinking that a Carnegie Mellon set up with money for Microsoft um there's an organization of the United States called computer science</slot>
  <slot end="1780" start="1760">Teachers Association CSTA and they have a website with a download that the proper way to specifically for high school teachers um where you can the a of a video into PowerPoint of how come people think is relevant for high school students and then others even this very</slot>
  <slot end="1800" start="1780">nice website called the S unplugged that Ashley teaches computational thinking without a computer cool words you can hear you can actually learn computational thinking contacts without actually using the computer and that's all I think that really says it is it is all about</slot>
  <slot end="1820" start="1800">thinking it's not about the Machine is target specifically for kids so that really in a says it in a child that it is possible um and it can be engaging and you can you can actually convey the skies concepts um and and</slot>
  <slot end="1840" start="1820">if you can learn of concepts they they can be valuable Inn in everyday life is there a problem solving so um what's the what did you not ask me that I should have asked the other words what do you want to leave our listeners with know that we finished episode</slot>
  <slot end="1860" start="1840">spread the word and makeup you taste of thinking commonplace okay cool that's a good summary adults only try to do that buy a market thanks bye bye Soda Springs to the end of this episode 10 dub for anything else we should take the time to</slot>
  <slot end="1880" start="1860">once again thank you for taking her time to be on the show um if you're interested in to stop a guy you can find a couple of resources in the show notes I have put all the stuff she mentioned in to the Lincoln collection of all to edit a couple of things one thing to tell if my own what is relevant in the area</slot>
  <slot end="1900" start="1880">anta well yeah SMS to the beginning um what's up and gaged Yamaha for brain hear some music from my apartment at the palms band come and the Sun is called York Apple its from one album bolts from the brand new album La Carreta tape at redstate.com</slot>
