## Description

University project, lecture Text Indexing. The idea is to search within
audio/video for keywords by building an inverted index beforehand.

We introduce the concept of timed documents. A timed document contains the
documents text sliced into blocks with time information. These documents are
produce by preprocessing from audio and video files and can be stored in a XML
format. The inverted index is generated upon these timed document.
