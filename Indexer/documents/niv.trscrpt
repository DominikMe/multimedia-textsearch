in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth now the earth was formless and empty darkness was over the surface of the deep and the spirit of god was hovering over the waters and god said let there be light and there was light god saw that the light was good and he separated the light from the darkness god called the light day and the darkness he called night and there was evening and there was morning the first day and god said let there be an expanse between the waters to separate water from water so god made the expanse and separated the water under the expanse from the water above it and it was so god called the expanse sky and there was evening and there was morning the second day and god said let the water under the sky be gathered to one place and let dry ground appear and it was so god called the dry ground land and the gathered waters he called seas and god saw that it was good then god said let the land produce vegetation seed bearing plants and trees on the land that bear fruit with seed in it according to their various kinds and it was so the land produced vegetation plants bearing seed according to their kinds and trees bearing fruit with seed in it according to their kinds and god saw that it was good and there was evening and there was morning the third day and god said let there be lights in the expanse of the sky to separate the day from the night and let them serve as signs to mark seasons and days and years and let them be lights in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth and it was so god made two great lights the greater light to govern the day and the lesser light to govern the night he also made the stars god set them in the expanse of the sky to give light on the earth to govern the day and the night and to separate light from darkness and god saw that it was good and there was evening and there was morning the fourth day and god said let the water teem with living creatures and let birds fly above the earth across the expanse of the sky so god created the great creatures of the sea and every living and moving thing with which the water teems according to their kinds and every winged bird according to its kind and god saw that it was good god blessed them and said be fruitful and increase in number and fill the water in the seas and let the birds increase on the earth and there was evening and there was morning the fifth day and god said let the land produce living creatures according to their kinds livestock creatures that move along the ground and wild animals each according to its kind and it was so god made the wild animals according to their kinds the livestock according to their kinds and all the creatures that move along the ground according to their kinds and god saw that it was good then god said let us make man in our image in our likeness and let them rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air over the livestock over all the earth and over all the creatures that move along the ground so god created man in his own image in the image of god he created him male and female he created them god blessed them and said to them be fruitful and increase in number fill the earth and subdue it rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground then god said i give you every seed bearing plant on the face of the whole earth and every tree that has fruit with seed in it they will be yours for food and to all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air and all the creatures that move on the ground everything that has the breath of life in it i give every green plant for food and it was so god saw all that he had made and it was very good and there was evening and there was morning the sixth day thus the heavens and the earth were completed in all their vast array by the seventh day god had finished the work he had been doing so on the seventh day he rested from all his work and god blessed the seventh day and made it holy because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done this is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created when the lord god made the earth and the heavens and no shrub of the field had yet appeared on the earth and no plant of the field had yet sprung up for the lord god had not sent rain on the earth and there was no man to work the ground but streams came up from the earth and watered the whole surface of the ground the lord god formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being now the lord god had planted a garden in the east in eden and there he put the man he had formed and the lord god made all kinds of trees grow out of the ground trees that were pleasing to the eye and good for food in the middle of the garden were the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil a river watering the garden flowed from eden from there it was separated into four headwaters the name of the first is the pishon it winds through the entire land of havilah where there is gold the gold of that land is good aromatic resin and onyx are also there the name of the second river is the gihon it winds through the entire land of cush the name of the third river is the tigris it runs along the east side of asshur and the fourth river is the euphrates the lord god took the man and put him in the garden of eden to work it and take care of it and the lord god commanded the man you are free to eat from any tree in the garden but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil for when you eat of it you will surely die the lord god said it is not good for the man to be alone i will make a helper suitable for him now the lord god had formed out of the ground all the beasts of the field and all the birds of the air he brought them to the man to see what he would name them and whatever the man called each living creature that was its name so the man gave names to all the livestock the birds of the air and all the beasts of the field but for adam no suitable helper was found so the lord god caused the man to fall into a deep sleep and while he was sleeping he took one of the mans ribs and closed up the place with flesh then the lord god made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man and he brought her to the man the man said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman for she was taken out of man for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and they will become one flesh the man and his wife were both naked and they felt no shame now the serpent was more crafty than any of the wild animals the lord god had made he said to the woman did god really say you must not eat from any tree in the garden the woman said to the serpent we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden but god did say you must not eat fruit from the tree that is in the middle of the garden and you must not touch it or you will die you will not surely die the serpent said to the woman for god knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened and you will be like god knowing good and evil when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it she also gave some to her husband who was with her and he ate it then the eyes of both of them were opened and they realized they were naked so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves then the man and his wife heard the sound of the lord god as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and they hid from the lord god among the trees of the garden but the lord god called to the man where are you he answered i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i hid and he said who told you that you were naked have you eaten from the tree that i commanded you not to eat from the man said the woman you put here with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and i ate it then the lord god said to the woman what is this you have done the woman said the serpent deceived me and i ate so the lord god said to the serpent because you have done this cursed are you above all the livestock and all the wild animals you will crawl on your belly and you will eat dust all the days of your life and i will put enmity between you and the woman and between your offspring and hers he will crush your head and you will strike his heel to the woman he said i will greatly increase your pains in childbearing with pain you will give birth to children your desire will be for your husband and he will rule over you to adam he said because you listened to your wife and ate from the tree about which i commanded you you must not eat of itcursed is the ground because of you through painful toil you will eat of it all the days of your life it will produce thorns and thistles for you and you will eat the plants of the field by the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return adam named his wife eve because she would become the mother of all the living the lord god made garments of skin for adam and his wife and clothed them and the lord god said the man has now become like one of us knowing good and evil he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and take also from the tree of life and eat and live forever so the lord god banished him from the garden of eden to work the ground from which he had been taken after he drove the man out he placed on the east side of the garden of eden cherubim and a flaming sword flashing back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life adam lay with his wife eve and she became pregnant and gave birth to cain she said with the help of the lord i have brought forth a man later she gave birth to his brother abel now abel kept flocks and cain worked the soil in the course of time cain brought some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the lord but abel brought fat portions from some of the firstborn of his flock the lord looked with favor on abel and his offering but on cain and his offering he did not look with favor so cain was very angry and his face was downcast then the lord said to cain why are you angry why is your face downcast if you do what is right will you not be accepted but if you do not do what is right sin is crouching at your door it desires to have you but you must master it now cain said to his brother abel lets go out to the field and while they were in the field cain attacked his brother abel and killed him then the lord said to cain where is your brother abeli dont know he replied am i my brothers keeper the lord said what have you done listen your brothers blood cries out to me from the ground now you are under a curse and driven from the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brothers blood from your hand when you work the ground it will no longer yield its crops for you you will be a restless wanderer on the earth cain said to the lord my punishment is more than i can bear today you are driving me from the land and i will be hidden from your presence i will be a restless wanderer on the earth and whoever finds me will kill me but the lord said to him not so if anyone kills cain he will suffer vengeance seven times over then the lord put a mark on cain so that no one who found him would kill him so cain went out from the lords presence and lived in the land of nod east of eden cain lay with his wife and she became pregnant and gave birth to enoch cain was then building a city and he named it after his son enoch to enoch was born irad and irad was the father of mehujael and mehujael was the father of methushael and methushael was the father of lamech lamech married two women one named adah and the other zillah adah gave birth to jabal he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock his brothers name was jubal he was the father of all who play the harp and flute zillah also had a son tubal cain who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron tubal cains sister was naamah lamech said to his wives adah and zillah listen to me wives of lamech hear my words i have killed a man for wounding me a young man for injuring me if cain is avenged seven times then lamech seventy seven times adam lay with his wife again and she gave birth to a son and named him seth saying god has granted me another child in place of abel since cain killed him seth also had a son and he named him enosh at that time men began to call on the name of the lord this is the written account of adams line when god created man he made him in the likeness of god he created them male and female and blessed them and when they were created he called them man when adam had lived 130 years he had a son in his own likeness in his own image and he named him seth after seth was born adam lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters altogether adam lived 930 years and then he died when seth had lived 105 years he became the father of enosh and after he became the father of enosh seth lived 807 years and had other sons and daughters altogether seth lived 912 years and then he died when enosh had lived 90 years he became the father of kenan and after he became the father of kenan enosh lived 815 years and had other sons and daughters altogether enosh lived 905 years and then he died when kenan had lived 70 years he became the father of mahalalel and after he became the father of mahalalel kenan lived 840 years and had other sons and daughters altogether kenan lived 910 years and then he died when mahalalel had lived 65 years he became the father of jared and after he became the father of jared mahalalel lived 830 years and had other sons and daughters altogether mahalalel lived 895 years and then he died when jared had lived 162 years he became the father of enoch and after he became the father of enoch jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters altogether jared lived 962 years and then he died when enoch had lived 65 years he became the father of methuselah and after he became the father of methuselah enoch walked with god 300 years and had other sons and daughters altogether enoch lived 365 years enoch walked with god then he was no more because god took him away when methuselah had lived 187 years he became the father of lamech and after he became the father of lamech methuselah lived 782 years and had other sons and daughters altogether methuselah lived 969 years and then he died when lamech had lived 182 years he had a son he named him noah and said he will comfort us in the labor and painful toil of our hands caused by the ground the lord has cursed after noah was born lamech lived 595 years and had other sons and daughters altogether lamech lived 777 years and then he died after noah was 500 years old he became the father of shem ham and japheth when men began to increase in number on the earth and daughters were born to them the sons of god saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and they married any of them they chose then the lord said my spirit will not contend with man forever for he is mortal his days will be a hundred and twenty years the nephilim were on the earth in those days and also afterward when the sons of god went to the daughters of men and had children by them they were the heroes of old men of renown the lord saw how great mans wickedness on the earth had become and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time the lord was grieved that he had made man on the earth and his heart was filled with pain so the lord said i will wipe mankind whom i have created from the face of the earth men and animals and creatures that move along the ground and birds of the air for i am grieved that i have made them but noah found favor in the eyes of the lord this is the account of noah noah was a righteous man blameless among the people of his time and he walked with god noah had three sons shem ham and japheth now the earth was corrupt in gods sight and was full of violence god saw how corrupt the earth had become for all the people on earth had corrupted their ways so god said to noah i am going to put an end to all people for the earth is filled with violence because of them i am surely going to destroy both them and the earth so make yourself an ark of cypress wood make rooms in it and coat it with pitch inside and out this is how you are to build it the ark is to be 450 feet long 75 feet wide and 45 feet high make a roof for it and finish the ark to within 18 inches of the top put a door in the side of the ark and make lower middle and upper decks i am going to bring floodwaters on the earth to destroy all life under the heavens every creature that has the breath of life in it everything on earth will perish but i will establish my covenant with you and you will enter the ark you and your sons and your wife and your sons wives with you you are to bring into the ark two of all living creatures male and female to keep them alive with you two of every kind of bird of every kind of animal and of every kind of creature that moves along the ground will come to you to be kept alive you are to take every kind of food that is to be eaten and store it away as food for you and for them noah did everything just as god commanded him the lord then said to noah go into the ark you and your whole family because i have found you righteous in this generation take with you seven of every kind of clean animal a male and its mate and two of every kind of unclean animal a male and its mate and also seven of every kind of bird male and female to keep their various kinds alive throughout the earth seven days from now i will send rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights and i will wipe from the face of the earth every living creature i have made and noah did all that the lord commanded him noah was six hundred years old when the floodwaters came on the earth and noah and his sons and his wife and his sons wives entered the ark to escape the waters of the flood pairs of clean and unclean animals of birds and of all creatures that move along the ground male and female came to noah and entered the ark as god had commanded noah and after the seven days the floodwaters came on the earth in the six hundredth year of noahs life on the seventeenth day of the second month on that day all the springs of the great deep burst forth and the floodgates of the heavens were opened and rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights on that very day noah and his sons shem ham and japheth together with his wife and the wives of his three sons entered the ark they had with them every wild animal according to its kind all livestock according to their kinds every creature that moves along the ground according to its kind and every bird according to its kind everything with wings pairs of all creatures that have the breath of life in them came to noah and entered the ark the animals going in were male and female of every living thing as god had commanded noah then the lord shut him in for forty days the flood kept coming on the earth and as the waters increased they lifted the ark high above the earth the waters rose and increased greatly on the earth and the ark floated on the surface of the water they rose greatly on the earth and all the high mountains under the entire heavens were covered the waters rose and covered the mountains to a depth of more than twenty feet every living thing that moved on the earth perished birds livestock wild animals all the creatures that swarm over the earth and all mankind everything on dry land that had the breath of life in its nostrils died every living thing on the face of the earth was wiped out men and animals and the creatures that move along the ground and the birds of the air were wiped from the earth only noah was left and those with him in the ark the waters flooded the earth for a hundred and fifty days but god remembered noah and all the wild animals and the livestock that were with him in the ark and he sent a wind over the earth and the waters receded now the springs of the deep and the floodgates of the heavens had been closed and the rain had stopped falling from the sky the water receded steadily from the earth at the end of the hundred and fifty days the water had gone down and on the seventeenth day of the seventh month the ark came to rest on the mountains of ararat the waters continued to recede until the tenth month and on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains became visible after forty days noah opened the window he had made in the ark and sent out a raven and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground but the dove could find no place to set its feet because there was water over all the surface of the earth so it returned to noah in the ark he reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark he waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark when the dove returned to him in the evening there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf then noah knew that the water had receded from the earth he waited seven more days and sent the dove out again but this time it did not return to him by the first day of the first month of noahs six hundred and first year the water had dried up from the earth noah then removed the covering from the ark and saw that the surface of the ground was dry by the twenty seventh day of the second month the earth was completely dry then god said to noah come out of the ark you and your wife and your sons and their wives bring out every kind of living creature that is with you the birds the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground so they can multiply on the earth and be fruitful and increase in number upon it so noah came out together with his sons and his wife and his sons wives all the animals and all the creatures that move along the ground and all the birds everything that moves on the earth came out of the ark one kind after another then noah built an altar to the lord and taking some of all the clean animals and clean birds he sacrificed burnt offerings on it the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart never again will i curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood and never again will i destroy all living creatures as i have done as long as the earth endures seedtime and harvest cold and heat summer and winter day and night will never cease then god blessed noah and his sons saying to them be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth the fear and dread of you will fall upon all the beasts of the earth and all the birds of the air upon every creature that moves along the ground and upon all the fish of the sea they are given into your hands everything that lives and moves will be food for you just as i gave you the green plants i now give you everything but you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it and for your lifeblood i will surely demand an accounting i will demand an accounting from every animal and from each man too i will demand an accounting for the life of his fellow man whoever sheds the blood of man by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god has god made man as for you be fruitful and increase in number multiply on the earth and increase upon it then god said to noah and to his sons with him i now establish my covenant with you and with your descendants after you and with every living creature that was with you the birds the livestock and all the wild animals all those that came out of the ark with you every living creature on earth i establish my covenant with you never again will all life be cut off by the waters of a flood never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth and god said this is the sign of the covenant i am making between me and you and every living creature with you a covenant for all generations to come i have set my rainbow in the clouds and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth whenever i bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow appears in the clouds i will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life whenever the rainbow appears in the clouds i will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between god and all living creatures of every kind on the earth so god said to noah this is the sign of the covenant i have established between me and all life on the earth the sons of noah who came out of the ark were shem ham and japheth ham was the father of canaan these were the three sons of noah and from them came the people who were scattered over the earth noah a man of the soil proceeded to plant a vineyard when he drank some of its wine he became drunk and lay uncovered inside his tent ham the father of canaan saw his fathers nakedness and told his two brothers outside but shem and japheth took a garment and laid it across their shoulders then they walked in backward and covered their fathers nakedness their faces were turned the other way so that they would not see their fathers nakedness when noah awoke from his wine and found out what his youngest son had done to him he said cursed be canaan the lowest of slaves will he be to his brothers he also said blessed be the lord the god of shem may canaan be the slave of shem may god extend the territory of japheth may japheth live in the tents of shem and may canaan be his slave after the flood noah lived 350 years altogether noah lived 950 years and then he died this is the account of shem ham and japheth noahs sons who themselves had sons after the flood the japhethites the sons of japheth gomer magog madai javan tubal meshech and tiras the sons of gomer ashkenaz riphath and togarmah the sons of javan elishah tarshish the kittim and the rodanim from these the maritime peoples spread out into their territories by their clans within their nations each with its own language the hamites the sons of ham cush mizraim put and canaan the sons of cush seba havilah sabtah raamah and sabteca the sons of raamah sheba and dedan cush was the father of nimrod who grew to be a mighty warrior on the earth he was a mighty hunter before the lord that is why it is said like nimrod a mighty hunter before the lord the first centers of his kingdom were babylon erech akkad and calneh in shinar from that land he went to assyria where he built nineveh rehoboth ir calah and resen which is between nineveh and calah that is the great city mizraim was the father of the ludites anamites lehabites naphtuhites pathrusites casluhites from whom the philistines came and caphtorites canaan was the father of sidon his firstborn and of the hittites jebusites amorites girgashites hivites arkites sinites arvadites zemarites and hamathites later the canaanite clans scattered and the borders of canaan reached from sidon toward gerar as far as gaza and then toward sodom gomorrah admah and zeboiim as far as lasha these are the sons of ham by their clans and languages in their territories and nations the semites sons were also born to shem whose older brother was japheth shem was the ancestor of all the sons of eber the sons of shem elam asshur arphaxad lud and aram the sons of aram uz hul gether and meshech arphaxad was the father of shelah and shelah the father of eber two sons were born to eber one was named peleg because in his time the earth was divided his brother was named joktan joktan was the father of almodad sheleph hazarmaveth jerah hadoram uzal diklah obal abimael sheba ophir havilah and jobab all these were sons of joktan the region where they lived stretched from mesha toward sephar in the eastern hill country these are the sons of shem by their clans and languages in their territories and nations these are the clans of noahs sons according to their lines of descent within their nations from these the nations spread out over the earth after the flood now the whole world had one language and a common speech as men moved eastward they found a plain in shinar and settled there they said to each other come lets make bricks and bake them thoroughly they used brick instead of stone and tar for mortar then they said come let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens so that we may make a name for ourselves and not be scattered over the face of the whole earth but the lord came down to see the city and the tower that the men were building the lord said if as one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this then nothing they plan to do will be impossible for them come let us go down and confuse their language so they will not understand each other so the lord scattered them from there over all the earth and they stopped building the city that is why it was called babel because there the lord confused the language of the whole world from there the lord scattered them over the face of the whole earth this is the account of shem two years after the flood when shem was 100 years old he became the father of arphaxad and after he became the father of arphaxad shem lived 500 years and had other sons and daughters when arphaxad had lived 35 years he became the father of shelah and after he became the father of shelah arphaxad lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters when shelah had lived 30 years he became the father of eber and after he became the father of eber shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters when eber had lived 34 years he became the father of peleg and after he became the father of peleg eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters when peleg had lived 30 years he became the father of reu and after he became the father of reu peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters when reu had lived 32 years he became the father of serug and after he became the father of serug reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters when serug had lived 30 years he became the father of nahor and after he became the father of nahor serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters when nahor had lived 29 years he became the father of terah and after he became the father of terah nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters after terah had lived 70 years he became the father of abram nahor and haran this is the account of terah terah became the father of abram nahor and haran and haran became the father of lot while his father terah was still alive haran died in ur of the chaldeans in the land of his birth abram and nahor both married the name of abrams wife was sarai and the name of nahors wife was milcah she was the daughter of haran the father of both milcah and iscah now sarai was barren she had no children terah took his son abram his grandson lot son of haran and his daughter in law sarai the wife of his son abram and together they set out from ur of the chaldeans to go to canaan but when they came to haran they settled there terah lived 205 years and he died in haran the lord had said to abram leave your country your people and your fathers household and go to the land i will show you i will make you into a great nation and i will bless you i will make your name great and you will be a blessing i will bless those who bless you and whoever curses you i will curse and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you so abram left as the lord had told him and lot went with him abram was seventy five years old when he set out from haran he took his wife sarai his nephew lot all the possessions they had accumulated and the people they had acquired in haran and they set out for the land of canaan and they arrived there abram traveled through the land as far as the site of the great tree of moreh at shechem at that time the canaanites were in the land the lord appeared to abram and said to your offspring i will give this land so he built an altar there to the lord who had appeared to him from there he went on toward the hills east of bethel and pitched his tent with bethel on the west and ai on the east there he built an altar to the lord and called on the name of the lord then abram set out and continued toward the negev now there was a famine in the land and abram went down to egypt to live there for a while because the famine was severe as he was about to enter egypt he said to his wife sarai i know what a beautiful woman you are when the egyptians see you they will say this is his wife then they will kill me but will let you live say you are my sister so that i will be treated well for your sake and my life will be spared because of you when abram came to egypt the egyptians saw that she was a very beautiful woman and when pharaohs officials saw her they praised her to pharaoh and she was taken into his palace he treated abram well for her sake and abram acquired sheep and cattle male and female donkeys menservants and maidservants and camels but the lord inflicted serious diseases on pharaoh and his household because of abrams wife sarai so pharaoh summoned abram what have you done to me he said why didnt you tell me she was your wife why did you say she is my sister so that i took her to be my wife now then here is your wife take her and go then pharaoh gave orders about abram to his men and they sent him on his way with his wife and everything he had so abram went up from egypt to the negev with his wife and everything he had and lot went with him abram had become very wealthy in livestock and in silver and gold from the negev he went from place to place until he came to bethel to the place between bethel and ai where his tent had been earlier and where he had first built an altar there abram called on the name of the lord now lot who was moving about with abram also had flocks and herds and tents but the land could not support them while they stayed together for their possessions were so great that they were not able to stay together and quarreling arose between abrams herdsmen and the herdsmen of lot the canaanites and perizzites were also living in the land at that time so abram said to lot lets not have any quarreling between you and me or between your herdsmen and mine for we are brothers is not the whole land before you lets part company if you go to the left ill go to the right if you go to the right ill go to the left lot looked up and saw that the whole plain of the jordan was well watered like the garden of the lord like the land of egypt toward zoar this was before the lord destroyed sodom and gomorrah so lot chose for himself the whole plain of the jordan and set out toward the east the two men parted company abram lived in the land of canaan while lot lived among the cities of the plain and pitched his tents near sodom now the men of sodom were wicked and were sinning greatly against the lord the lord said to abram after lot had parted from him lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south east and west all the land that you see i will give to you and your offspring forever i will make your offspring like the dust of the earth so that if anyone could count the dust then your offspring could be counted go walk through the length and breadth of the land for i am giving it to you so abram moved his tents and went to live near the great trees of mamre at hebron where he built an altar to the lord at this time amraphel king of shinar arioch king of ellasar kedorlaomer king of elam and tidal king of goiim went to war against bera king of sodom birsha king of gomorrah shinab king of admah shemeber king of zeboiim and the king of bela that is zoar all these latter kings joined forces in the valley of siddim the salt sea  for twelve years they had been subject to kedorlaomer but in the thirteenth year they rebelled in the fourteenth year kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him went out and defeated the rephaites in ashteroth karnaim the zuzites in ham the emites in shaveh kiriathaim and the horites in the hill country of seir as far as el paran near the desert then they turned back and went to en mishpat that is kadesh and they conquered the whole territory of the amalekites as well as the amorites who were living in hazazon tamar then the king of sodom the king of gomorrah the king of admah the king of zeboiim and the king of bela that is zoar marched out and drew up their battle lines in the valley of siddim against kedorlaomer king of elam tidal king of goiim amraphel king of shinar and arioch king of ellasar four kings against five now the valley of siddim was full of tar pits and when the kings of sodom and gomorrah fled some of the men fell into them and the rest fled to the hills the four kings seized all the goods of sodom and gomorrah and all their food then they went away they also carried off abrams nephew lot and his possessions since he was living in sodom one who had escaped came and reported this to abram the hebrew now abram was living near the great trees of mamre the amorite a brother of eshcol and aner all of whom were allied with abram when abram heard that his relative had been taken captive he called out the 318 trained men born in his household and went in pursuit as far as dan during the night abram divided his men to attack them and he routed them pursuing them as far as hobah north of damascus he recovered all the goods and brought back his relative lot and his possessions together with the women and the other people after abram returned from defeating kedorlaomer and the kings allied with him the king of sodom came out to meet him in the valley of shaveh that is the kings valley then melchizedek king of salem brought out bread and wine he was priest of god most high and he blessed abram saying blessed be abram by god most high creator of heaven and earth and blessed be god most high who delivered your enemies into your hand then abram gave him a tenth of everything the king of sodom said to abram give me the people and keep the goods for yourself but abram said to the king of sodom i have raised my hand to the lord god most high creator of heaven and earth and have taken an oath that i will accept nothing belonging to you not even a thread or the thong of a sandal so that you will never be able to say i made abram rich i will accept nothing but what my men have eaten and the share that belongs to the men who went with me to aner eshcol and mamre let them have their share after this the word of the lord came to abram in a vision do not be afraid abram i am your shield your very great reward but abram said o sovereign lord what can you give me since i remain childless and the one who will inherit my estate is eliezer of damascus and abram said you have given me no children so a servant in my household will be my heir then the word of the lord came to him this man will not be your heir but a son coming from your own body will be your heir he took him outside and said look up at the heavens and count the stars if indeed you can count them then he said to him so shall your offspring be abram believed the lord and he credited it to him as righteousness he also said to him i am the lord who brought you out of ur of the chaldeans to give you this land to take possession of it but abram said o sovereign lord how can i know that i will gain possession of it so the lord said to him bring me a heifer a goat and a ram each three years old along with a dove and a young pigeon abram brought all these to him cut them in two and arranged the halves opposite each other the birds however he did not cut in half then birds of prey came down on the carcasses but abram drove them away as the sun was setting abram fell into a deep sleep and a thick and dreadful darkness came over him then the lord said to him know for certain that your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years but i will punish the nation they serve as slaves and afterward they will come out with great possessions you however will go to your fathers in peace and be buried at a good old age in the fourth generation your descendants will come back here for the sin of the amorites has not yet reached its full measure when the sun had set and darkness had fallen a smoking firepot with a blazing torch appeared and passed between the pieces on that day the lord made a covenant with abram and said to your descendants i give this land from the river of egypt to the great river the euphrates the land of the kenites kenizzites kadmonites hittites perizzites rephaites amorites canaanites girgashites and jebusites now sarai abrams wife had borne him no children but she had an egyptian maidservant named hagar so she said to abram the lord has kept me from having children go sleep with my maidservant perhaps i can build a family through her abram agreed to what sarai said so after abram had been living in canaan ten years sarai his wife took her egyptian maidservant hagar and gave her to her husband to be his wife he slept with hagar and she conceived when she knew she was pregnant she began to despise her mistress then sarai said to abram you are responsible for the wrong i am suffering i put my servant in your arms and now that she knows she is pregnant she despises me may the lord judge between you and me your servant is in your hands abram said do with her whatever you think best then sarai mistreated hagar so she fled from her the angel of the lord found hagar near a spring in the desert it was the spring that is beside the road to shur and he said hagar servant of sarai where have you come from and where are you goingim running away from my mistress sarai she answered then the angel of the lord told her go back to your mistress and submit to her the angel added i will so increase your descendants that they will be too numerous to count the angel of the lord also said to her you are now with child and you will have a son you shall name him ishmael for the lord has heard of your misery he will be a wild donkey of a man his hand will be against everyone and everyones hand against him and he will live in hostility toward all his brothers she gave this name to the lord who spoke to her you are the god who sees me for she said i have now seen the one who sees me that is why the well was called beer lahai roi it is still there between kadesh and bered so hagar bore abram a son and abram gave the name ishmael to the son she had borne abram was eighty six years old when hagar bore him ishmael when abram was ninety nine years old the lord appeared to him and said i am god almighty walk before me and be blameless i will confirm my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers abram fell facedown and god said to him as for me this is my covenant with you you will be the father of many nations no longer will you be called abram your name will be abraham for i have made you a father of many nations i will make you very fruitful i will make nations of you and kings will come from you i will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come to be your god and the god of your descendants after you the whole land of canaan where you are now an alien i will give as an everlasting possession to you and your descendants after you and i will be their god then god said to abraham as for you you must keep my covenant you and your descendants after you for the generations to come this is my covenant with you and your descendants after you the covenant you are to keep every male among you shall be circumcised you are to undergo circumcision and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you for the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner those who are not your offspring whether born in your household or bought with your money they must be circumcised my covenant in your flesh is to be an everlasting covenant any uncircumcised male who has not been circumcised in the flesh will be cut off from his people he has broken my covenant god also said to abraham as for sarai your wife you are no longer to call her sarai her name will be sarah i will bless her and will surely give you a son by her i will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations kings of peoples will come from her abraham fell facedown he laughed and said to himself will a son be born to a man a hundred years old will sarah bear a child at the age of ninety and abraham said to god if only ishmael might live under your blessing then god said yes but your wife sarah will bear you a son and you will call him isaac i will establish my covenant with him as an everlasting covenant for his descendants after him and as for ishmael i have heard you i will surely bless him i will make him fruitful and will greatly increase his numbers he will be the father of twelve rulers and i will make him into a great nation but my covenant i will establish with isaac whom sarah will bear to you by this time next year when he had finished speaking with abraham god went up from him on that very day abraham took his son ishmael and all those born in his household or bought with his money every male in his household and circumcised them as god told him abraham was ninety nine years old when he was circumcised and his son ishmael was thirteen abraham and his son ishmael were both circumcised on that same day and every male in abrahams household including those born in his household or bought from a foreigner was circumcised with him the lord appeared to abraham near the great trees of mamre while he was sitting at the entrance to his tent in the heat of the day abraham looked up and saw three men standing nearby when he saw them he hurried from the entrance of his tent to meet them and bowed low to the ground he said if i have found favor in your eyes my lord do not pass your servant by let a little water be brought and then you may all wash your feet and rest under this tree let me get you something to eat so you can be refreshed and then go on your way now that you have come to your servantvery well they answered do as you say so abraham hurried into the tent to sarah quick he said get three seahs of fine flour and knead it and bake some bread then he ran to the herd and selected a choice tender calf and gave it to a servant who hurried to prepare it he then brought some curds and milk and the calf that had been prepared and set these before them while they ate he stood near them under a tree where is your wife sarah they asked him there in the tent he said then the lord said i will surely return to you about this time next year and sarah your wife will have a son now sarah was listening at the entrance to the tent which was behind him abraham and sarah were already old and well advanced in years and sarah was past the age of childbearing so sarah laughed to herself as she thought after i am worn out and my master is old will i now have this pleasure then the lord said to abraham why did sarah laugh and say will i really have a child now that i am old is anything too hard for the lord i will return to you at the appointed time next year and sarah will have a son sarah was afraid so she lied and said i did not laugh but he said yes you did laugh when the men got up to leave they looked down toward sodom and abraham walked along with them to see them on their way then the lord said shall i hide from abraham what i am about to do abraham will surely become a great and powerful nation and all nations on earth will be blessed through him for i have chosen him so that he will direct his children and his household after him to keep the way of the lord by doing what is right and just so that the lord will bring about for abraham what he has promised him then the lord said the outcry against sodom and gomorrah is so great and their sin so grievous that i will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me if not i will know the men turned away and went toward sodom but abraham remained standing before the lord then abraham approached him and said will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked what if there are fifty righteous people in the city will you really sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous people in it far be it from you to do such a thing to kill the righteous with the wicked treating the righteous and the wicked alike far be it from you will not the judge of all the earth do right the lord said if i find fifty righteous people in the city of sodom i will spare the whole place for their sake then abraham spoke up again now that i have been so bold as to speak to the lord though i am nothing but dust and ashes what if the number of the righteous is five less than fifty will you destroy the whole city because of five peopleif i find forty five there he said i will not destroy it once again he spoke to him what if only forty are found there he said for the sake of forty i will not do it then he said may the lord not be angry but let me speak what if only thirty can be found there he answered i will not do it if i find thirty there abraham said now that i have been so bold as to speak to the lord what if only twenty can be found there he said for the sake of twenty i will not destroy it then he said may the lord not be angry but let me speak just once more what if only ten can be found there he answered for the sake of ten i will not destroy it when the lord had finished speaking with abraham he left and abraham returned home the two angels arrived at sodom in the evening and lot was sitting in the gateway of the city when he saw them he got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground my lords he said please turn aside to your servants house you can wash your feet and spend the night and then go on your way early in the morningno they answered we will spend the night in the square but he insisted so strongly that they did go with him and entered his house he prepared a meal for them baking bread without yeast and they ate before they had gone to bed all the men from every part of the city of sodom both young and old surrounded the house they called to lot where are the men who came to you tonight bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them lot went outside to meet them and shut the door behind him and said no my friends dont do this wicked thing look i have two daughters who have never slept with a man let me bring them out to you and you can do what you like with them but dont do anything to these men for they have come under the protection of my roof get out of our way they replied and they said this fellow came here as an alien and now he wants to play the judge well treat you worse than them they kept bringing pressure on lot and moved forward to break down the door but the men inside reached out and pulled lot back into the house and shut the door then they struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old with blindness so that they could not find the door the two men said to lot do you have anyone else here sons in law sons or daughters or anyone else in the city who belongs to you get them out of here because we are going to destroy this place the outcry to the lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it so lot went out and spoke to his sons in law who were pledged to marry his daughters he said hurry and get out of this place because the lord is about to destroy the city but his sons in law thought he was joking with the coming of dawn the angels urged lot saying hurry take your wife and your two daughters who are here or you will be swept away when the city is punished when he hesitated the men grasped his hand and the hands of his wife and of his two daughters and led them safely out of the city for the lord was merciful to them as soon as they had brought them out one of them said flee for your lives dont look back and dont stop anywhere in the plain flee to the mountains or you will be swept away but lot said to them no my lords please your servant has found favor in your eyes and you have shown great kindness to me in sparing my life but i cant flee to the mountains this disaster will overtake me and ill die look here is a town near enough to run to and it is small let me flee to it it is very small isnt it then my life will be spared he said to him very well i will grant this request too i will not overthrow the town you speak of but flee there quickly because i cannot do anything until you reach it that is why the town was called zoar  by the time lot reached zoar the sun had risen over the land then the lord rained down burning sulfur on sodom and gomorrah from the lord out of the heavens thus he overthrew those cities and the entire plain including all those living in the cities and also the vegetation in the land but lots wife looked back and she became a pillar of salt early the next morning abraham got up and returned to the place where he had stood before the lord he looked down toward sodom and gomorrah toward all the land of the plain and he saw dense smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace so when god destroyed the cities of the plain he remembered abraham and he brought lot out of the catastrophe that overthrew the cities where lot had lived lot and his two daughters left zoar and settled in the mountains for he was afraid to stay in zoar he and his two daughters lived in a cave one day the older daughter said to the younger our father is old and there is no man around here to lie with us as is the custom all over the earth lets get our father to drink wine and then lie with him and preserve our family line through our father that night they got their father to drink wine and the older daughter went in and lay with him he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up the next day the older daughter said to the younger last night i lay with my father lets get him to drink wine again tonight and you go in and lie with him so we can preserve our family line through our father so they got their father to drink wine that night also and the younger daughter went and lay with him again he was not aware of it when she lay down or when she got up so both of lots daughters became pregnant by their father the older daughter had a son and she named him moab he is the father of the moabites of today the younger daughter also had a son and she named him ben ammi he is the father of the ammonites of today now abraham moved on from there into the region of the negev and lived between kadesh and shur for a while he stayed in gerar and there abraham said of his wife sarah she is my sister then abimelech king of gerar sent for sarah and took her but god came to abimelech in a dream one night and said to him you are as good as dead because of the woman you have taken she is a married woman now abimelech had not gone near her so he said lord will you destroy an innocent nation did he not say to me she is my sister and didnt she also say he is my brother i have done this with a clear conscience and clean hands then god said to him in the dream yes i know you did this with a clear conscience and so i have kept you from sinning against me that is why i did not let you touch her now return the mans wife for he is a prophet and he will pray for you and you will live but if you do not return her you may be sure that you and all yours will die early the next morning abimelech summoned all his officials and when he told them all that had happened they were very much afraid then abimelech called abraham in and said what have you done to us how have i wronged you that you have brought such great guilt upon me and my kingdom you have done things to me that should not be done and abimelech asked abraham what was your reason for doing this abraham replied i said to myself there is surely no fear of god in this place and they will kill me because of my wife besides she really is my sister the daughter of my father though not of my mother and she became my wife and when god had me wander from my fathers household i said to her this is how you can show your love to me everywhere we go say of me he is my brother then abimelech brought sheep and cattle and male and female slaves and gave them to abraham and he returned sarah his wife to him and abimelech said my land is before you live wherever you like to sarah he said i am giving your brother a thousand shekels of silver this is to cover the offense against you before all who are with you you are completely vindicated then abraham prayed to god and god healed abimelech his wife and his slave girls so they could have children again for the lord had closed up every womb in abimelechs household because of abrahams wife sarah now the lord was gracious to sarah as he had said and the lord did for sarah what he had promised sarah became pregnant and bore a son to abraham in his old age at the very time god had promised him abraham gave the name isaac to the son sarah bore him when his son isaac was eight days old abraham circumcised him as god commanded him abraham was a hundred years old when his son isaac was born to him sarah said god has brought me laughter and everyone who hears about this will laugh with me and she added who would have said to abraham that sarah would nurse children yet i have borne him a son in his old age the child grew and was weaned and on the day isaac was weaned abraham held a great feast but sarah saw that the son whom hagar the egyptian had borne to abraham was mocking and she said to abraham get rid of that slave woman and her son for that slave womans son will never share in the inheritance with my son isaac the matter distressed abraham greatly because it concerned his son but god said to him do not be so distressed about the boy and your maidservant listen to whatever sarah tells you because it is through isaac that your offspring will be reckoned i will make the son of the maidservant into a nation also because he is your offspring early the next morning abraham took some food and a skin of water and gave them to hagar he set them on her shoulders and then sent her off with the boy she went on her way and wandered in the desert of beersheba when the water in the skin was gone she put the boy under one of the bushes then she went off and sat down nearby about a bowshot away for she thought i cannot watch the boy die and as she sat there nearby she began to sob god heard the boy crying and the angel of god called to hagar from heaven and said to her what is the matter hagar do not be afraid god has heard the boy crying as he lies there lift the boy up and take him by the hand for i will make him into a great nation then god opened her eyes and she saw a well of water so she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink god was with the boy as he grew up he lived in the desert and became an archer while he was living in the desert of paran his mother got a wife for him from egypt at that time abimelech and phicol the commander of his forces said to abraham god is with you in everything you do now swear to me here before god that you will not deal falsely with me or my children or my descendants show to me and the country where you are living as an alien the same kindness i have shown to you abraham said i swear it then abraham complained to abimelech about a well of water that abimelechs servants had seized but abimelech said i dont know who has done this you did not tell me and i heard about it only today so abraham brought sheep and cattle and gave them to abimelech and the two men made a treaty abraham set apart seven ewe lambs from the flock and abimelech asked abraham what is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs you have set apart by themselves he replied accept these seven lambs from my hand as a witness that i dug this well so that place was called beersheba because the two men swore an oath there after the treaty had been made at beersheba abimelech and phicol the commander of his forces returned to the land of the philistines abraham planted a tamarisk tree in beersheba and there he called upon the name of the lord the eternal god and abraham stayed in the land of the philistines for a long time some time later god tested abraham he said to him abrahamhere i am he replied then god said take your son your only son isaac whom you love and go to the region of moriah sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains i will tell you about early the next morning abraham got up and saddled his donkey he took with him two of his servants and his son isaac when he had cut enough wood for the burnt offering he set out for the place god had told him about on the third day abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance he said to his servants stay here with the donkey while i and the boy go over there we will worship and then we will come back to you abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son isaac and he himself carried the fire and the knife as the two of them went on together isaac spoke up and said to his father abraham fatheryes my son abraham replied the fire and wood are here isaac said but where is the lamb for the burnt offering abraham answered god himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering my son and the two of them went on together when they reached the place god had told him about abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood on it he bound his son isaac and laid him on the altar on top of the wood then he reached out his hand and took the knife to slay his son but the angel of the lord called out to him from heaven abraham abrahamhere i am he replied do not lay a hand on the boy he said do not do anything to him now i know that you fear god because you have not withheld from me your son your only son abraham looked up and there in a thicket he saw a ram caught by its horns he went over and took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son so abraham called that place the lord will provide and to this day it is said on the mountain of the lord it will be provided the angel of the lord called to abraham from heaven a second time and said i swear by myself declares the lord that because you have done this and have not withheld your son your only son i will surely bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore your descendants will take possession of the cities of their enemies and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed because you have obeyed me then abraham returned to his servants and they set off together for beersheba and abraham stayed in beersheba some time later abraham was told milcah is also a mother she has borne sons to your brother nahor uz the firstborn buz his brother kemuel the father of aram kesed hazo pildash jidlaph and bethuel bethuel became the father of rebekah milcah bore these eight sons to abrahams brother nahor his concubine whose name was reumah also had sons tebah gaham tahash and maacah sarah lived to be a hundred and twenty seven years old she died at kiriath arba that is hebron in the land of canaan and abraham went to mourn for sarah and to weep over her then abraham rose from beside his dead wife and spoke to the hittites he said i am an alien and a stranger among you sell me some property for a burial site here so i can bury my dead the hittites replied to abraham sir listen to us you are a mighty prince among us bury your dead in the choicest of our tombs none of us will refuse you his tomb for burying your dead then abraham rose and bowed down before the people of the land the hittites he said to them if you are willing to let me bury my dead then listen to me and intercede with ephron son of zohar on my behalf so he will sell me the cave of machpelah which belongs to him and is at the end of his field ask him to sell it to me for the full price as a burial site among you ephron the hittite was sitting among his people and he replied to abraham in the hearing of all the hittites who had come to the gate of his city no my lord he said listen to me i give you the field and i give you the cave that is in it i give it to you in the presence of my people bury your dead again abraham bowed down before the people of the land and he said to ephron in their hearing listen to me if you will i will pay the price of the field accept it from me so i can bury my dead there ephron answered abraham listen to me my lord the land is worth four hundred shekels of silver but what is that between me and you bury your dead abraham agreed to ephrons terms and weighed out for him the price he had named in the hearing of the hittites four hundred shekels of silver according to the weight current among the merchants so ephrons field in machpelah near mamre both the field and the cave in it and all the trees within the borders of the field was deeded to abraham as his property in the presence of all the hittites who had come to the gate of the city afterward abraham buried his wife sarah in the cave in the field of machpelah near mamre which is at hebron in the land of canaan so the field and the cave in it were deeded to abraham by the hittites as a burial site abraham was now old and well advanced in years and the lord had blessed him in every way he said to the chief servant in his household the one in charge of all that he had put your hand under my thigh i want you to swear by the lord the god of heaven and the god of earth that you will not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the canaanites among whom i am living but will go to my country and my own relatives and get a wife for my son isaac the servant asked him what if the woman is unwilling to come back with me to this land shall i then take your son back to the country you came from make sure that you do not take my son back there abraham said the lord the god of heaven who brought me out of my fathers household and my native land and who spoke to me and promised me on oath saying to your offspring i will give this land he will send his angel before you so that you can get a wife for my son from there if the woman is unwilling to come back with you then you will be released from this oath of mine only do not take my son back there so the servant put his hand under the thigh of his master abraham and swore an oath to him concerning this matter then the servant took ten of his masters camels and left taking with him all kinds of good things from his master he set out for aram naharaim and made his way to the town of nahor he had the camels kneel down near the well outside the town it was toward evening the time the women go out to draw water then he prayed o lord god of my master abraham give me success today and show kindness to my master abraham see i am standing beside this spring and the daughters of the townspeople are coming out to draw water may it be that when i say to a girl please let down your jar that i may have a drink and she says drink and ill water your camels too let her be the one you have chosen for your servant isaac by this i will know that you have shown kindness to my master before he had finished praying rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder she was the daughter of bethuel son of milcah who was the wife of abrahams brother nahor the girl was very beautiful a virgin no man had ever lain with her she went down to the spring filled her jar and came up again the servant hurried to meet her and said please give me a little water from your jar drink my lord she said and quickly lowered the jar to her hands and gave him a drink after she had given him a drink she said ill draw water for your camels too until they have finished drinking so she quickly emptied her jar into the trough ran back to the well to draw more water and drew enough for all his camels without saying a word the man watched her closely to learn whether or not the lord had made his journey successful when the camels had finished drinking the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a beka and two gold bracelets weighing ten shekels then he asked whose daughter are you please tell me is there room in your fathers house for us to spend the night she answered him i am the daughter of bethuel the son that milcah bore to nahor and she added we have plenty of straw and fodder as well as room for you to spend the night then the man bowed down and worshiped the lord saying praise be to the lord the god of my master abraham who has not abandoned his kindness and faithfulness to my master as for me the lord has led me on the journey to the house of my masters relatives the girl ran and told her mothers household about these things now rebekah had a brother named laban and he hurried out to the man at the spring as soon as he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sisters arms and had heard rebekah tell what the man said to her he went out to the man and found him standing by the camels near the spring come you who are blessed by the lord he said why are you standing out here i have prepared the house and a place for the camels so the man went to the house and the camels were unloaded straw and fodder were brought for the camels and water for him and his men to wash their feet then food was set before him but he said i will not eat until i have told you what i have to saythen tell us laban said so he said i am abrahams servant the lord has blessed my master abundantly and he has become wealthy he has given him sheep and cattle silver and gold menservants and maidservants and camels and donkeys my masters wife sarah has borne him a son in her old age and he has given him everything he owns and my master made me swear an oath and said you must not get a wife for my son from the daughters of the canaanites in whose land i live but go to my fathers family and to my own clan and get a wife for my son then i asked my master what if the woman will not come back with me he replied the lord before whom i have walked will send his angel with you and make your journey a success so that you can get a wife for my son from my own clan and from my fathers family then when you go to my clan you will be released from my oath even if they refuse to give her to you you will be released from my oath when i came to the spring today i said o lord god of my master abraham if you will please grant success to the journey on which i have come see i am standing beside this spring if a maiden comes out to draw water and i say to her please let me drink a little water from your jar and if she says to me drink and ill draw water for your camels too let her be the one the lord has chosen for my masters son before i finished praying in my heart rebekah came out with her jar on her shoulder she went down to the spring and drew water and i said to her please give me a drink she quickly lowered her jar from her shoulder and said drink and ill water your camels too so i drank and she watered the camels also i asked her whose daughter are youshe said the daughter of bethuel son of nahor whom milcah bore to himthen i put the ring in her nose and the bracelets on her arms and i bowed down and worshiped the lord i praised the lord the god of my master abraham who had led me on the right road to get the granddaughter of my masters brother for his son now if you will show kindness and faithfulness to my master tell me and if not tell me so i may know which way to turn laban and bethuel answered this is from the lord we can say nothing to you one way or the other here is rebekah take her and go and let her become the wife of your masters son as the lord has directed when abrahams servant heard what they said he bowed down to the ground before the lord then the servant brought out gold and silver jewelry and articles of clothing and gave them to rebekah he also gave costly gifts to her brother and to her mother then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night there when they got up the next morning he said send me on my way to my master but her brother and her mother replied let the girl remain with us ten days or so then you may go but he said to them do not detain me now that the lord has granted success to my journey send me on my way so i may go to my master then they said lets call the girl and ask her about it so they called rebekah and asked her will you go with this mani will go she said so they sent their sister rebekah on her way along with her nurse and abrahams servant and his men and they blessed rebekah and said to her our sister may you increase to thousands upon thousands may your offspring possess the gates of their enemies then rebekah and her maids got ready and mounted their camels and went back with the man so the servant took rebekah and left now isaac had come from beer lahai roi for he was living in the negev he went out to the field one evening to meditate and as he looked up he saw camels approaching rebekah also looked up and saw isaac she got down from her camel and asked the servant who is that man in the field coming to meet ushe is my master the servant answered so she took her veil and covered herself then the servant told isaac all he had done isaac brought her into the tent of his mother sarah and he married rebekah so she became his wife and he loved her and isaac was comforted after his mothers death abraham took another wife whose name was keturah she bore him zimran jokshan medan midian ishbak and shuah jokshan was the father of sheba and dedan the descendants of dedan were the asshurites the letushites and the leummites the sons of midian were ephah epher hanoch abida and eldaah all these were descendants of keturah abraham left everything he owned to isaac but while he was still living he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them away from his son isaac to the land of the east altogether abraham lived a hundred and seventy five years then abraham breathed his last and died at a good old age an old man and full of years and he was gathered to his people his sons isaac and ishmael buried him in the cave of machpelah near mamre in the field of ephron son of zohar the hittite the field abraham had bought from the hittites there abraham was buried with his wife sarah after abrahams death god blessed his son isaac who then lived near beer lahai roi this is the account of abrahams son ishmael whom sarahs maidservant hagar the egyptian bore to abraham these are the names of the sons of ishmael listed in the order of their birth nebaioth the firstborn of ishmael kedar adbeel mibsam mishma dumah massa hadad tema jetur naphish and kedemah these were the sons of ishmael and these are the names of the twelve tribal rulers according to their settlements and camps altogether ishmael lived a hundred and thirty seven years he breathed his last and died and he was gathered to his people his descendants settled in the area from havilah to shur near the border of egypt as you go toward asshur and they lived in hostility toward all their brothers this is the account of abrahams son isaac abraham became the father of isaac and isaac was forty years old when he married rebekah daughter of bethuel the aramean from paddan aram and sister of laban the aramean isaac prayed to the lord on behalf of his wife because she was barren the lord answered his prayer and his wife rebekah became pregnant the babies jostled each other within her and she said why is this happening to me so she went to inquire of the lord the lord said to her two nations are in your womb and two peoples from within you will be separated one people will be stronger than the other and the older will serve the younger when the time came for her to give birth there were twin boys in her womb the first to come out was red and his whole body was like a hairy garment so they named him esau after this his brother came out with his hand grasping esaus heel so he was named jacob isaac was sixty years old when rebekah gave birth to them the boys grew up and esau became a skillful hunter a man of the open country while jacob was a quiet man staying among the tents isaac who had a taste for wild game loved esau but rebekah loved jacob once when jacob was cooking some stew esau came in from the open country famished he said to jacob quick let me have some of that red stew im famished that is why he was also called edom  jacob replied first sell me your birthright look i am about to die esau said what good is the birthright to me but jacob said swear to me first so he swore an oath to him selling his birthright to jacob then jacob gave esau some bread and some lentil stew he ate and drank and then got up and left so esau despised his birthright now there was a famine in the land besides the earlier famine of abrahams time and isaac went to abimelech king of the philistines in gerar the lord appeared to isaac and said do not go down to egypt live in the land where i tell you to live stay in this land for a while and i will be with you and will bless you for to you and your descendants i will give all these lands and will confirm the oath i swore to your father abraham i will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and will give them all these lands and through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed because abraham obeyed me and kept my requirements my commands my decrees and my laws so isaac stayed in gerar when the men of that place asked him about his wife he said she is my sister because he was afraid to say she is my wife he thought the men of this place might kill me on account of rebekah because she is beautiful when isaac had been there a long time abimelech king of the philistines looked down from a window and saw isaac caressing his wife rebekah so abimelech summoned isaac and said she is really your wife why did you say she is my sister isaac answered him because i thought i might lose my life on account of her then abimelech said what is this you have done to us one of the men might well have slept with your wife and you would have brought guilt upon us so abimelech gave orders to all the people anyone who molests this man or his wife shall surely be put to death isaac planted crops in that land and the same year reaped a hundredfold because the lord blessed him the man became rich and his wealth continued to grow until he became very wealthy he had so many flocks and herds and servants that the philistines envied him so all the wells that his fathers servants had dug in the time of his father abraham the philistines stopped up filling them with earth then abimelech said to isaac move away from us you have become too powerful for us so isaac moved away from there and encamped in the valley of gerar and settled there isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father abraham which the philistines had stopped up after abraham died and he gave them the same names his father had given them isaacs servants dug in the valley and discovered a well of fresh water there but the herdsmen of gerar quarreled with isaacs herdsmen and said the water is ours so he named the well esek because they disputed with him then they dug another well but they quarreled over that one also so he named it sitnah he moved on from there and dug another well and no one quarreled over it he named it rehoboth saying now the lord has given us room and we will flourish in the land from there he went up to beersheba that night the lord appeared to him and said i am the god of your father abraham do not be afraid for i am with you i will bless you and will increase the number of your descendants for the sake of my servant abraham isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the lord there he pitched his tent and there his servants dug a well meanwhile abimelech had come to him from gerar with ahuzzath his personal adviser and phicol the commander of his forces isaac asked them why have you come to me since you were hostile to me and sent me away they answered we saw clearly that the lord was with you so we said there ought to be a sworn agreement between us between us and you let us make a treaty with you that you will do us no harm just as we did not molest you but always treated you well and sent you away in peace and now you are blessed by the lord isaac then made a feast for them and they ate and drank early the next morning the men swore an oath to each other then isaac sent them on their way and they left him in peace that day isaacs servants came and told him about the well they had dug they said weve found water he called it shibah and to this day the name of the town has been beersheba when esau was forty years old he married judith daughter of beeri the hittite and also basemath daughter of elon the hittite they were a source of grief to isaac and rebekah when isaac was old and his eyes were so weak that he could no longer see he called for esau his older son and said to him my sonhere i am he answered isaac said i am now an old man and dont know the day of my death now then get your weapons your quiver and bow and go out to the open country to hunt some wild game for me prepare me the kind of tasty food i like and bring it to me to eat so that i may give you my blessing before i die now rebekah was listening as isaac spoke to his son esau when esau left for the open country to hunt game and bring it back rebekah said to her son jacob look i overheard your father say to your brother esau bring me some game and prepare me some tasty food to eat so that i may give you my blessing in the presence of the lord before i die now my son listen carefully and do what i tell you go out to the flock and bring me two choice young goats so i can prepare some tasty food for your father just the way he likes it then take it to your father to eat so that he may give you his blessing before he dies jacob said to rebekah his mother but my brother esau is a hairy man and im a man with smooth skin what if my father touches me i would appear to be tricking him and would bring down a curse on myself rather than a blessing his mother said to him my son let the curse fall on me just do what i say go and get them for me so he went and got them and brought them to his mother and she prepared some tasty food just the way his father liked it then rebekah took the best clothes of esau her older son which she had in the house and put them on her younger son jacob she also covered his hands and the smooth part of his neck with the goatskins then she handed to her son jacob the tasty food and the bread she had made he went to his father and said my fatheryes my son he answered who is it jacob said to his father i am esau your firstborn i have done as you told me please sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing isaac asked his son how did you find it so quickly my sonthe lord your god gave me success he replied then isaac said to jacob come near so i can touch you my son to know whether you really are my son esau or not jacob went close to his father isaac who touched him and said the voice is the voice of jacob but the hands are the hands of esau he did not recognize him for his hands were hairy like those of his brother esau so he blessed him are you really my son esau he asked i am he replied then he said my son bring me some of your game to eat so that i may give you my blessing jacob brought it to him and he ate and he brought some wine and he drank then his father isaac said to him come here my son and kiss me so he went to him and kissed him when isaac caught the smell of his clothes he blessed him and said ah the smell of my son is like the smell of a field that the lord has blessed may god give you of heavens dew and of earths richness an abundance of grain and new wine may nations serve you and peoples bow down to you be lord over your brothers and may the sons of your mother bow down to you may those who curse you be cursed and those who bless you be blessed after isaac finished blessing him and jacob had scarcely left his fathers presence his brother esau came in from hunting he too prepared some tasty food and brought it to his father then he said to him my father sit up and eat some of my game so that you may give me your blessing his father isaac asked him who are youi am your son he answered your firstborn esau isaac trembled violently and said who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me i ate it just before you came and i blessed him and indeed he will be blessed when esau heard his fathers words he burst out with a loud and bitter cry and said to his father bless me me too my father but he said your brother came deceitfully and took your blessing esau said isnt he rightly named jacob he has deceived me these two times he took my birthright and now hes taken my blessing then he asked havent you reserved any blessing for me isaac answered esau i have made him lord over you and have made all his relatives his servants and i have sustained him with grain and new wine so what can i possibly do for you my son esau said to his father do you have only one blessing my father bless me too my father then esau wept aloud his father isaac answered him your dwelling will be away from the earths richness away from the dew of heaven above you will live by the sword and you will serve your brother but when you grow restless you will throw his yoke from off your neck esau held a grudge against jacob because of the blessing his father had given him he said to himself the days of mourning for my father are near then i will kill my brother jacob when rebekah was told what her older son esau had said she sent for her younger son jacob and said to him your brother esau is consoling himself with the thought of killing you now then my son do what i say flee at once to my brother laban in haran stay with him for a while until your brothers fury subsides when your brother is no longer angry with you and forgets what you did to him ill send word for you to come back from there why should i lose both of you in one day then rebekah said to isaac im disgusted with living because of these hittite women if jacob takes a wife from among the women of this land from hittite women like these my life will not be worth living so isaac called for jacob and blessed him and commanded him do not marry a canaanite woman go at once to paddan aram to the house of your mothers father bethuel take a wife for yourself there from among the daughters of laban your mothers brother may god almighty bless you and make you fruitful and increase your numbers until you become a community of peoples may he give you and your descendants the blessing given to abraham so that you may take possession of the land where you now live as an alien the land god gave to abraham then isaac sent jacob on his way and he went to paddan aram to laban son of bethuel the aramean the brother of rebekah who was the mother of jacob and esau now esau learned that isaac had blessed jacob and had sent him to paddan aram to take a wife from there and that when he blessed him he commanded him do not marry a canaanite woman and that jacob had obeyed his father and mother and had gone to paddan aram esau then realized how displeasing the canaanite women were to his father isaac so he went to ishmael and married mahalath the sister of nebaioth and daughter of ishmael son of abraham in addition to the wives he already had jacob left beersheba and set out for haran when he reached a certain place he stopped for the night because the sun had set taking one of the stones there he put it under his head and lay down to sleep he had a dream in which he saw a stairway resting on the earth with its top reaching to heaven and the angels of god were ascending and descending on it there above it stood the lord and he said i am the lord the god of your father abraham and the god of isaac i will give you and your descendants the land on which you are lying your descendants will be like the dust of the earth and you will spread out to the west and to the east to the north and to the south all peoples on earth will be blessed through you and your offspring i am with you and will watch over you wherever you go and i will bring you back to this land i will not leave you until i have done what i have promised you when jacob awoke from his sleep he thought surely the lord is in this place and i was not aware of it he was afraid and said how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of god this is the gate of heaven early the next morning jacob took the stone he had placed under his head and set it up as a pillar and poured oil on top of it he called that place bethel though the city used to be called luz then jacob made a vow saying if god will be with me and will watch over me on this journey i am taking and will give me food to eat and clothes to wear so that i return safely to my fathers house then the lord will be my god and this stone that i have set up as a pillar will be gods house and of all that you give me i will give you a tenth then jacob continued on his journey and came to the land of the eastern peoples there he saw a well in the field with three flocks of sheep lying near it because the flocks were watered from that well the stone over the mouth of the well was large when all the flocks were gathered there the shepherds would roll the stone away from the wells mouth and water the sheep then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well jacob asked the shepherds my brothers where are you fromwere from haran they replied he said to them do you know laban nahors grandsonyes we know him they answered then jacob asked them is he wellyes he is they said and here comes his daughter rachel with the sheep look he said the sun is still high it is not time for the flocks to be gathered water the sheep and take them back to pasture we cant they replied until all the flocks are gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the mouth of the well then we will water the sheep while he was still talking with them rachel came with her fathers sheep for she was a shepherdess when jacob saw rachel daughter of laban his mothers brother and labans sheep he went over and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered his uncles sheep then jacob kissed rachel and began to weep aloud he had told rachel that he was a relative of her father and a son of rebekah so she ran and told her father as soon as laban heard the news about jacob his sisters son he hurried to meet him he embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his home and there jacob told him all these things then laban said to him you are my own flesh and blood after jacob had stayed with him for a whole month laban said to him just because you are a relative of mine should you work for me for nothing tell me what your wages should be now laban had two daughters the name of the older was leah and the name of the younger was rachel leah had weak eyes but rachel was lovely in form and beautiful jacob was in love with rachel and said ill work for you seven years in return for your younger daughter rachel laban said its better that i give her to you than to some other man stay here with me so jacob served seven years to get rachel but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her then jacob said to laban give me my wife my time is completed and i want to lie with her so laban brought together all the people of the place and gave a feast but when evening came he took his daughter leah and gave her to jacob and jacob lay with her and laban gave his servant girl zilpah to his daughter as her maidservant when morning came there was leah so jacob said to laban what is this you have done to me i served you for rachel didnt i why have you deceived me laban replied it is not our custom here to give the younger daughter in marriage before the older one finish this daughters bridal week then we will give you the younger one also in return for another seven years of work and jacob did so he finished the week with leah and then laban gave him his daughter rachel to be his wife laban gave his servant girl bilhah to his daughter rachel as her maidservant jacob lay with rachel also and he loved rachel more than leah and he worked for laban another seven years when the lord saw that leah was not loved he opened her womb but rachel was barren leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son she named him reuben for she said it is because the lord has seen my misery surely my husband will love me now she conceived again and when she gave birth to a son she said because the lord heard that i am not loved he gave me this one too so she named him simeon again she conceived and when she gave birth to a son she said now at last my husband will become attached to me because i have borne him three sons so he was named levi she conceived again and when she gave birth to a son she said this time i will praise the lord so she named him judah then she stopped having children when rachel saw that she was not bearing jacob any children she became jealous of her sister so she said to jacob give me children or ill die jacob became angry with her and said am i in the place of god who has kept you from having children then she said here is bilhah my maidservant sleep with her so that she can bear children for me and that through her i too can build a family so she gave him her servant bilhah as a wife jacob slept with her and she became pregnant and bore him a son then rachel said god has vindicated me he has listened to my plea and given me a son because of this she named him dan rachels servant bilhah conceived again and bore jacob a second son then rachel said i have had a great struggle with my sister and i have won so she named him naphtali when leah saw that she had stopped having children she took her maidservant zilpah and gave her to jacob as a wife leahs servant zilpah bore jacob a son then leah said what good fortune so she named him gad leahs servant zilpah bore jacob a second son then leah said how happy i am the women will call me happy so she named him asher during wheat harvest reuben went out into the fields and found some mandrake plants which he brought to his mother leah rachel said to leah please give me some of your sons mandrakes but she said to her wasnt it enough that you took away my husband will you take my sons mandrakes toovery well rachel said he can sleep with you tonight in return for your sons mandrakes so when jacob came in from the fields that evening leah went out to meet him you must sleep with me she said i have hired you with my sons mandrakes so he slept with her that night god listened to leah and she became pregnant and bore jacob a fifth son then leah said god has rewarded me for giving my maidservant to my husband so she named him issachar leah conceived again and bore jacob a sixth son then leah said god has presented me with a precious gift this time my husband will treat me with honor because i have borne him six sons so she named him zebulun some time later she gave birth to a daughter and named her dinah then god remembered rachel he listened to her and opened her womb she became pregnant and gave birth to a son and said god has taken away my disgrace she named him joseph and said may the lord add to me another son after rachel gave birth to joseph jacob said to laban send me on my way so i can go back to my own homeland give me my wives and children for whom i have served you and i will be on my way you know how much work ive done for you but laban said to him if i have found favor in your eyes please stay i have learned by divination that the lord has blessed me because of you he added name your wages and i will pay them jacob said to him you know how i have worked for you and how your livestock has fared under my care the little you had before i came has increased greatly and the lord has blessed you wherever i have been but now when may i do something for my own household what shall i give you he asked dont give me anything jacob replied but if you will do this one thing for me i will go on tending your flocks and watching over them let me go through all your flocks today and remove from them every speckled or spotted sheep every dark colored lamb and every spotted or speckled goat they will be my wages and my honesty will testify for me in the future whenever you check on the wages you have paid me any goat in my possession that is not speckled or spotted or any lamb that is not dark colored will be considered stolen agreed said laban let it be as you have said that same day he removed all the male goats that were streaked or spotted and all the speckled or spotted female goats all that had white on them and all the dark colored lambs and he placed them in the care of his sons then he put a three day journey between himself and jacob while jacob continued to tend the rest of labans flocks jacob however took fresh cut branches from poplar almond and plane trees and made white stripes on them by peeling the bark and exposing the white inner wood of the branches then he placed the peeled branches in all the watering troughs so that they would be directly in front of the flocks when they came to drink when the flocks were in heat and came to drink they mated in front of the branches and they bore young that were streaked or speckled or spotted jacob set apart the young of the flock by themselves but made the rest face the streaked and dark colored animals that belonged to laban thus he made separate flocks for himself and did not put them with labans animals whenever the stronger females were in heat jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the animals so they would mate near the branches but if the animals were weak he would not place them there so the weak animals went to laban and the strong ones to jacob in this way the man grew exceedingly prosperous and came to own large flocks and maidservants and menservants and camels and donkeys jacob heard that labans sons were saying jacob has taken everything our father owned and has gained all this wealth from what belonged to our father and jacob noticed that labans attitude toward him was not what it had been then the lord said to jacob go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives and i will be with you so jacob sent word to rachel and leah to come out to the fields where his flocks were he said to them i see that your fathers attitude toward me is not what it was before but the god of my father has been with me you know that ive worked for your father with all my strength yet your father has cheated me by changing my wages ten times however god has not allowed him to harm me if he said the speckled ones will be your wages then all the flocks gave birth to speckled young and if he said the streaked ones will be your wages then all the flocks bore streaked young so god has taken away your fathers livestock and has given them to me in breeding season i once had a dream in which i looked up and saw that the male goats mating with the flock were streaked speckled or spotted the angel of god said to me in the dream jacob i answered here i am and he said look up and see that all the male goats mating with the flock are streaked speckled or spotted for i have seen all that laban has been doing to you i am the god of bethel where you anointed a pillar and where you made a vow to me now leave this land at once and go back to your native land then rachel and leah replied do we still have any share in the inheritance of our fathers estate does he not regard us as foreigners not only has he sold us but he has used up what was paid for us surely all the wealth that god took away from our father belongs to us and our children so do whatever god has told you then jacob put his children and his wives on camels and he drove all his livestock ahead of him along with all the goods he had accumulated in paddan aram to go to his father isaac in the land of canaan when laban had gone to shear his sheep rachel stole her fathers household gods moreover jacob deceived laban the aramean by not telling him he was running away so he fled with all he had and crossing the river he headed for the hill country of gilead on the third day laban was told that jacob had fled taking his relatives with him he pursued jacob for seven days and caught up with him in the hill country of gilead then god came to laban the aramean in a dream at night and said to him be careful not to say anything to jacob either good or bad jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country of gilead when laban overtook him and laban and his relatives camped there too then laban said to jacob what have you done youve deceived me and youve carried off my daughters like captives in war why did you run off secretly and deceive me why didnt you tell me so i could send you away with joy and singing to the music of tambourines and harps you didnt even let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters good by you have done a foolish thing i have the power to harm you but last night the god of your father said to me be careful not to say anything to jacob either good or bad now you have gone off because you longed to return to your fathers house but why did you steal my gods jacob answered laban i was afraid because i thought you would take your daughters away from me by force but if you find anyone who has your gods he shall not live in the presence of our relatives see for yourself whether there is anything of yours here with me and if so take it now jacob did not know that rachel had stolen the gods so laban went into jacobs tent and into leahs tent and into the tent of the two maidservants but he found nothing after he came out of leahs tent he entered rachels tent now rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camels saddle and was sitting on them laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing rachel said to her father dont be angry my lord that i cannot stand up in your presence im having my period so he searched but could not find the household gods jacob was angry and took laban to task what is my crime he asked laban what sin have i committed that you hunt me down now that you have searched through all my goods what have you found that belongs to your household put it here in front of your relatives and mine and let them judge between the two of us i have been with you for twenty years now your sheep and goats have not miscarried nor have i eaten rams from your flocks i did not bring you animals torn by wild beasts i bore the loss myself and you demanded payment from me for whatever was stolen by day or night this was my situation the heat consumed me in the daytime and the cold at night and sleep fled from my eyes it was like this for the twenty years i was in your household i worked for you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your flocks and you changed my wages ten times if the god of my father the god of abraham and the fear of isaac had not been with me you would surely have sent me away empty handed but god has seen my hardship and the toil of my hands and last night he rebuked you laban answered jacob the women are my daughters the children are my children and the flocks are my flocks all you see is mine yet what can i do today about these daughters of mine or about the children they have borne come now lets make a covenant you and i and let it serve as a witness between us so jacob took a stone and set it up as a pillar he said to his relatives gather some stones so they took stones and piled them in a heap and they ate there by the heap laban called it jegar sahadutha and jacob called it galeed laban said this heap is a witness between you and me today that is why it was called galeed it was also called mizpah because he said may the lord keep watch between you and me when we are away from each other if you mistreat my daughters or if you take any wives besides my daughters even though no one is with us remember that god is a witness between you and me laban also said to jacob here is this heap and here is this pillar i have set up between you and me this heap is a witness and this pillar is a witness that i will not go past this heap to your side to harm you and that you will not go past this heap and pillar to my side to harm me may the god of abraham and the god of nahor the god of their father judge between us so jacob took an oath in the name of the fear of his father isaac he offered a sacrifice there in the hill country and invited his relatives to a meal after they had eaten they spent the night there early the next morning laban kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them then he left and returned home jacob also went on his way and the angels of god met him when jacob saw them he said this is the camp of god so he named that place mahanaim jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother esau in the land of seir the country of edom he instructed them this is what you are to say to my master esau your servant jacob says i have been staying with laban and have remained there till now i have cattle and donkeys sheep and goats menservants and maidservants now i am sending this message to my lord that i may find favor in your eyes when the messengers returned to jacob they said we went to your brother esau and now he is coming to meet you and four hundred men are with him in great fear and distress jacob divided the people who were with him into two groups and the flocks and herds and camels as well he thought if esau comes and attacks one group the group that is left may escape then jacob prayed o god of my father abraham god of my father isaac o lord who said to me go back to your country and your relatives and i will make you prosper i am unworthy of all the kindness and faithfulness you have shown your servant i had only my staff when i crossed this jordan but now i have become two groups save me i pray from the hand of my brother esau for i am afraid he will come and attack me and also the mothers with their children but you have said i will surely make you prosper and will make your descendants like the sand of the sea which cannot be counted he spent the night there and from what he had with him he selected a gift for his brother esau two hundred female goats and twenty male goats two hundred ewes and twenty rams thirty female camels with their young forty cows and ten bulls and twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys he put them in the care of his servants each herd by itself and said to his servants go ahead of me and keep some space between the herds he instructed the one in the lead when my brother esau meets you and asks to whom do you belong and where are you going and who owns all these animals in front of you then you are to say they belong to your servant jacob they are a gift sent to my lord esau and he is coming behind us he also instructed the second the third and all the others who followed the herds you are to say the same thing to esau when you meet him and be sure to say your servant jacob is coming behind us for he thought i will pacify him with these gifts i am sending on ahead later when i see him perhaps he will receive me so jacobs gifts went on ahead of him but he himself spent the night in the camp that night jacob got up and took his two wives his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed the ford of the jabbok after he had sent them across the stream he sent over all his possessions so jacob was left alone and a man wrestled with him till daybreak when the man saw that he could not overpower him he touched the socket of jacobs hip so that his hip was wrenched as he wrestled with the man then the man said let me go for it is daybreak but jacob replied i will not let you go unless you bless me the man asked him what is your namejacob he answered then the man said your name will no longer be jacob but israel because you have struggled with god and with men and have overcome jacob said please tell me your name but he replied why do you ask my name then he blessed him there so jacob called the place peniel saying it is because i saw god face to face and yet my life was spared the sun rose above him as he passed peniel and he was limping because of his hip therefore to this day the israelites do not eat the tendon attached to the socket of the hip because the socket of jacobs hip was touched near the tendon jacob looked up and there was esau coming with his four hundred men so he divided the children among leah rachel and the two maidservants he put the maidservants and their children in front leah and her children next and rachel and joseph in the rear he himself went on ahead and bowed down to the ground seven times as he approached his brother but esau ran to meet jacob and embraced him he threw his arms around his neck and kissed him and they wept then esau looked up and saw the women and children who are these with you he asked jacob answered they are the children god has graciously given your servant then the maidservants and their children approached and bowed down next leah and her children came and bowed down last of all came joseph and rachel and they too bowed down esau asked what do you mean by all these droves i metto find favor in your eyes my lord he said but esau said i already have plenty my brother keep what you have for yourself no please said jacob if i have found favor in your eyes accept this gift from me for to see your face is like seeing the face of god now that you have received me favorably please accept the present that was brought to you for god has been gracious to me and i have all i need and because jacob insisted esau accepted it then esau said let us be on our way ill accompany you but jacob said to him my lord knows that the children are tender and that i must care for the ewes and cows that are nursing their young if they are driven hard just one day all the animals will die so let my lord go on ahead of his servant while i move along slowly at the pace of the droves before me and that of the children until i come to my lord in seir esau said then let me leave some of my men with youbut why do that jacob asked just let me find favor in the eyes of my lord so that day esau started on his way back to seir jacob however went to succoth where he built a place for himself and made shelters for his livestock that is why the place is called succoth after jacob came from paddan aram he arrived safely at the city of shechem in canaan and camped within sight of the city for a hundred pieces of silver he bought from the sons of hamor the father of shechem the plot of ground where he pitched his tent there he set up an altar and called it el elohe israel now dinah the daughter leah had borne to jacob went out to visit the women of the land when shechem son of hamor the hivite the ruler of that area saw her he took her and violated her his heart was drawn to dinah daughter of jacob and he loved the girl and spoke tenderly to her and shechem said to his father hamor get me this girl as my wife when jacob heard that his daughter dinah had been defiled his sons were in the fields with his livestock so he kept quiet about it until they came home then shechems father hamor went out to talk with jacob now jacobs sons had come in from the fields as soon as they heard what had happened they were filled with grief and fury because shechem had done a disgraceful thing in israel by lying with jacobs daughter a thing that should not be done but hamor said to them my son shechem has his heart set on your daughter please give her to him as his wife intermarry with us give us your daughters and take our daughters for yourselves you can settle among us the land is open to you live in it trade in it and acquire property in it then shechem said to dinahs father and brothers let me find favor in your eyes and i will give you whatever you ask make the price for the bride and the gift i am to bring as great as you like and ill pay whatever you ask me only give me the girl as my wife because their sister dinah had been defiled jacobs sons replied deceitfully as they spoke to shechem and his father hamor they said to them we cant do such a thing we cant give our sister to a man who is not circumcised that would be a disgrace to us we will give our consent to you on one condition only that you become like us by circumcising all your males then we will give you our daughters and take your daughters for ourselves well settle among you and become one people with you but if you will not agree to be circumcised well take our sister and go their proposal seemed good to hamor and his son shechem the young man who was the most honored of all his fathers household lost no time in doing what they said because he was delighted with jacobs daughter so hamor and his son shechem went to the gate of their city to speak to their fellow townsmen these men are friendly toward us they said let them live in our land and trade in it the land has plenty of room for them we can marry their daughters and they can marry ours but the men will consent to live with us as one people only on the condition that our males be circumcised as they themselves are wont their livestock their property and all their other animals become ours so let us give our consent to them and they will settle among us all the men who went out of the city gate agreed with hamor and his son shechem and every male in the city was circumcised three days later while all of them were still in pain two of jacobs sons simeon and levi dinahs brothers took their swords and attacked the unsuspecting city killing every male they put hamor and his son shechem to the sword and took dinah from shechems house and left the sons of jacob came upon the dead bodies and looted the city where their sister had been defiled they seized their flocks and herds and donkeys and everything else of theirs in the city and out in the fields they carried off all their wealth and all their women and children taking as plunder everything in the houses then jacob said to simeon and levi you have brought trouble on me by making me a stench to the canaanites and perizzites the people living in this land we are few in number and if they join forces against me and attack me i and my household will be destroyed but they replied should he have treated our sister like a prostitute then god said to jacob go up to bethel and settle there and build an altar there to god who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother esau so jacob said to his household and to all who were with him get rid of the foreign gods you have with you and purify yourselves and change your clothes then come let us go up to bethel where i will build an altar to god who answered me in the day of my distress and who has been with me wherever i have gone so they gave jacob all the foreign gods they had and the rings in their ears and jacob buried them under the oak at shechem then they set out and the terror of god fell upon the towns all around them so that no one pursued them jacob and all the people with him came to luz that is bethel in the land of canaan there he built an altar and he called the place el bethel because it was there that god revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from his brother now deborah rebekahs nurse died and was buried under the oak below bethel so it was named allon bacuth after jacob returned from paddan aram god appeared to him again and blessed him god said to him your name is jacob but you will no longer be called jacob your name will be israel so he named him israel and god said to him i am god almighty be fruitful and increase in number a nation and a community of nations will come from you and kings will come from your body the land i gave to abraham and isaac i also give to you and i will give this land to your descendants after you then god went up from him at the place where he had talked with him jacob set up a stone pillar at the place where god had talked with him and he poured out a drink offering on it he also poured oil on it jacob called the place where god had talked with him bethel then they moved on from bethel while they were still some distance from ephrath rachel began to give birth and had great difficulty and as she was having great difficulty in childbirth the midwife said to her dont be afraid for you have another son as she breathed her last for she was dying she named her son ben oni but his father named him benjamin so rachel died and was buried on the way to ephrath that is bethlehem over her tomb jacob set up a pillar and to this day that pillar marks rachels tomb israel moved on again and pitched his tent beyond migdal eder while israel was living in that region reuben went in and slept with his fathers concubine bilhah and israel heard of it jacob had twelve sons the sons of leah reuben the firstborn of jacob simeon levi judah issachar and zebulun the sons of rachel joseph and benjamin the sons of rachels maidservant bilhah dan and naphtali the sons of leahs maidservant zilpah gad and asher these were the sons of jacob who were born to him in paddan aram jacob came home to his father isaac in mamre near kiriath arba that is hebron where abraham and isaac had stayed isaac lived a hundred and eighty years then he breathed his last and died and was gathered to his people old and full of years and his sons esau and jacob buried him this is the account of esau that is edom esau took his wives from the women of canaan adah daughter of elon the hittite and oholibamah daughter of anah and granddaughter of zibeon the hivite also basemath daughter of ishmael and sister of nebaioth adah bore eliphaz to esau basemath bore reuel and oholibamah bore jeush jalam and korah these were the sons of esau who were born to him in canaan esau took his wives and sons and daughters and all the members of his household as well as his livestock and all his other animals and all the goods he had acquired in canaan and moved to a land some distance from his brother jacob their possessions were too great for them to remain together the land where they were staying could not support them both because of their livestock so esau that is edom settled in the hill country of seir this is the account of esau the father of the edomites in the hill country of seir these are the names of esaus sons eliphaz the son of esaus wife adah and reuel the son of esaus wife basemath the sons of eliphaz teman omar zepho gatam and kenaz esaus son eliphaz also had a concubine named timna who bore him amalek these were grandsons of esaus wife adah the sons of

esau the father of the edomites jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed the land of canaan this is the account of jacob joseph a young man of seventeen was tending the flocks with his brothers the sons of bilhah and the sons of zilpah his fathers wives and he brought their father a bad report about them now israel loved joseph more than any of his other sons because he had been born to him in his old age and he made a richly ornamented robe for him when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than any of them they hated him and could not speak a kind word to him joseph had a dream and when he told it to his brothers they hated him all the more he said to them listen to this dream i had we were binding sheaves of grain out in the field when suddenly my sheaf rose and stood upright while your sheaves gathered around mine and bowed down to it his brothers said to him do you intend to reign over us will you actually rule us and they hated him all the more because of his dream and what he had said then he had another dream and he told it to his brothers listen he said i had another dream and this time the sun and moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me when he told his father as well as his brothers his father rebuked him and said what is this dream you had will your mother and i and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you his brothers were jealous of him but his father kept the matter in mind now his brothers had gone to graze their fathers flocks near shechem and israel said to joseph as you know your brothers are grazing the flocks near shechem come i am going to send you to themvery well he replied so he said to him go and see if all is well with your brothers and with the flocks and bring word back to me then he sent him off from the valley of hebron when joseph arrived at shechem a man found him wandering around in the fields and asked him what are you looking for he replied im looking for my brothers can you tell me where they are grazing their flocks they have moved on from here the man answered i heard them say lets go to dothan so joseph went after his brothers and found them near dothan but they saw him in the distance and before he reached them they plotted to kill him here comes that dreamer they said to each other come now lets kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns and say that a ferocious animal devoured him then well see what comes of his dreams when reuben heard this he tried to rescue him from their hands lets not take his life he said dont shed any blood throw him into this cistern here in the desert but dont lay a hand on him reuben said this to rescue him from them and take him back to his father so when joseph came to his brothers they stripped him of his robe the richly ornamented robe he was wearing and they took him and threw him into the cistern now the cistern was empty there was no water in it as they sat down to eat their meal they looked up and saw a caravan of ishmaelites coming from gilead their camels were loaded with spices balm and myrrh and they were on their way to take them down to egypt judah said to his brothers what will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood come lets sell him to the ishmaelites and not lay our hands on him after all he is our brother our own flesh and blood his brothers agreed so when the midianite merchants came by his brothers pulled joseph up out of the cistern and sold him for twenty shekels of silver to the ishmaelites who took him to egypt when reuben returned to the cistern and saw that joseph was not there he tore his clothes he went back to his brothers and said the boy isnt there where can i turn now then they got josephs robe slaughtered a goat and dipped the robe in the blood they took the ornamented robe back to their father and said we found this examine it to see whether it is your sons robe he recognized it and said it is my sons robe some ferocious animal has devoured him joseph has surely been torn to pieces then jacob tore his clothes put on sackcloth and mourned for his son many days all his sons and daughters came to comfort him but he refused to be comforted no he said in mourning will i go down to the grave to my son so his father wept for him meanwhile the midianites sold joseph in egypt to potiphar one of pharaohs officials the captain of the guard at that time judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of adullam named hirah there judah met the daughter of a canaanite man named shua he married her and lay with her she became pregnant and gave birth to a son who was named er she conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him onan she gave birth to still another son and named him shelah it was at kezib that she gave birth to him judah got a wife for er his firstborn and her name was tamar but er judahs firstborn was wicked in the lords sight so the lord put him to death then judah said to onan lie with your brothers wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother in law to produce offspring for your brother but onan knew that the offspring would not be his so whenever he lay with his brothers wife he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from producing offspring for his brother what he did was wicked in the lords sight so he put him to death also judah then said to his daughter in law tamar live as a widow in your fathers house until my son shelah grows up for he thought he may die too just like his brothers so tamar went to live in her fathers house after a long time judahs wife the daughter of shua died when judah had recovered from his grief he went up to timnah to the men who were shearing his sheep and his friend hirah the adullamite went with him when tamar was told your father in law is on his way to timnah to shear his sheep she took off her widows clothes covered herself with a veil to disguise herself and then sat down at the entrance to enaim which is on the road to timnah for she saw that though shelah had now grown up she had not been given to him as his wife when judah saw her he thought she was a prostitute for she had covered her face not realizing that she was his daughter in law he went over to her by the roadside and said come now let me sleep with youand what will you give me to sleep with you she asked ill send you a young goat from my flock he said will you give me something as a pledge until you send it she asked he said what pledge should i give youyour seal and its cord and the staff in your hand she answered so he gave them to her and slept with her and she became pregnant by him after she left she took off her veil and put on her widows clothes again meanwhile judah sent the young goat by his friend the adullamite in order to get his pledge back from the woman but he did not find her he asked the men who lived there where is the shrine prostitute who was beside the road at enaimthere hasnt been any shrine prostitute here they said so he went back to judah and said i didnt find her besides the men who lived there said there hasnt been any shrine prostitute here then judah said let her keep what she has or we will become a laughingstock after all i did send her this young goat but you didnt find her about three months later judah was told your daughter in law tamar is guilty of prostitution and as a result she is now pregnant judah said bring her out and have her burned to death as she was being brought out she sent a message to her father in law i am pregnant by the man who owns these she said and she added see if you recognize whose seal and cord and staff these are judah recognized them and said she is more righteous than i since i wouldnt give her to my son shelah and he did not sleep with her again when the time came for her to give birth there were twin boys in her womb as she was giving birth one of them put out his hand so the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied it on his wrist and said this one came out first but when he drew back his hand his brother came out and she said so this is how you have broken out and he was named perez then his brother who had the scarlet thread on his wrist came out and he was given the name zerah now joseph had been taken down to egypt potiphar an egyptian who was one of pharaohs officials the captain of the guard bought him from the ishmaelites who had taken him there the lord was with joseph and he prospered and he lived in the house of his egyptian master when his master saw that the lord was with him and that the lord gave him success in everything he did joseph found favor in his eyes and became his attendant potiphar put him in charge of his household and he entrusted to his care everything he owned from the time he put him in charge of his household and of all that he owned the lord blessed the household of the egyptian because of joseph the blessing of the lord was on everything potiphar had both in the house and in the field so he left in josephs care everything he had with joseph in charge he did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate now joseph was well built and handsome and after a while his masters wife took notice of joseph and said come to bed with me but he refused with me in charge he told her my master does not concern himself with anything in the house everything he owns he has entrusted to my care no one is greater in this house than i am my master has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife how then could i do such a wicked thing and sin against god and though she spoke to joseph day after day he refused to go to bed with her or even be with her one day he went into the house to attend to his duties and none of the household servants was inside she caught him by his cloak and said come to bed with me but he left his cloak in her hand and ran out of the house when she saw that he had left his cloak in her hand and had run out of the house she called her household servants look she said to them this hebrew has been brought to us to make sport of us he came in here to sleep with me but i screamed when he heard me scream for help he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house she kept his cloak beside her until his master came home then she told him this story that hebrew slave you brought us came to me to make sport of me but as soon as i screamed for help he left his cloak beside me and ran out of the house when his master heard the story his wife told him saying this is how your slave treated me he burned with anger josephs master took him and put him in prison the place where the kings prisoners were confined but while joseph was there in the prison the lord was with him he showed him kindness and granted him favor in the eyes of the prison warden so the warden put joseph in charge of all those held in the prison and he was made responsible for all that was done there the warden paid no attention to anything under josephs care because the lord was with joseph and gave him success in whatever he did some time later the cupbearer and the baker of the king of egypt offended their master the king of egypt pharaoh was angry with his two officials the chief cupbearer and the chief baker and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard in the same prison where joseph was confined the captain of the guard assigned them to joseph and he attended them after they had been in custody for some time each of the two men the cupbearer and the baker of the king of egypt who were being held in prison had a dream the same night and each dream had a meaning of its own when joseph came to them the next morning he saw that they were dejected so he asked pharaohs officials who were in custody with him in his masters house why are your faces so sad today we both had dreams they answered but there is no one to interpret them then joseph said to them do not interpretations belong to god tell me your dreams so the chief cupbearer told joseph his dream he said to him in my dream i saw a vine in front of me and on the vine were three branches as soon as it budded it blossomed and its clusters ripened into grapes pharaohs cup was in my hand and i took the grapes squeezed them into pharaohs cup and put the cup in his hand this is what it means joseph said to him the three branches are three days within three days pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position and you will put pharaohs cup in his hand just as you used to do when you were his cupbearer but when all goes well with you remember me and show me kindness mention me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison for i was forcibly carried off from the land of the hebrews and even here i have done nothing to deserve being put in a dungeon when the chief baker saw that joseph had given a favorable interpretation he said to joseph i too had a dream on my head were three baskets of bread in the top basket were all kinds of baked goods for pharaoh but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head this is what it means joseph said the three baskets are three days within three days pharaoh will lift off your head and hang you on a tree and the birds will eat away your flesh now the third day was pharaohs birthday and he gave a feast for all his officials he lifted up the heads of the chief cupbearer and the chief baker in the presence of his officials he restored the chief cupbearer to his position so that he once again put the cup into pharaohs hand but he hanged the chief baker just as joseph had said to them in his interpretation the chief cupbearer however did not remember joseph he forgot him when two full years had passed pharaoh had a dream he was standing by the nile when out of the river there came up seven cows sleek and fat and they grazed among the reeds after them seven other cows ugly and gaunt came up out of the nile and stood beside those on the riverbank and the cows that were ugly and gaunt ate up the seven sleek fat cows then pharaoh woke up he fell asleep again and had a second dream seven heads of grain healthy and good were growing on a single stalk after them seven other heads of grain sprouted thin and scorched by the east wind the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy full heads then pharaoh woke up it had been a dream in the morning his mind was troubled so he sent for all the magicians and wise men of egypt pharaoh told them his dreams but no one could interpret them for him then the chief cupbearer said to pharaoh today i am reminded of my shortcomings pharaoh was once angry with his servants and he imprisoned me and the chief baker in the house of the captain of the guard each of us had a dream the same night and each dream had a meaning of its own now a young hebrew was there with us a servant of the captain of the guard we told him our dreams and he interpreted them for us giving each man the interpretation of his dream and things turned out exactly as he interpreted them to us i was restored to my position and the other man was hanged so pharaoh sent for joseph and he was quickly brought from the dungeon when he had shaved and changed his clothes he came before pharaoh pharaoh said to joseph i had a dream and no one can interpret it but i have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it i cannot do it joseph replied to pharaoh but god will give pharaoh the answer he desires then pharaoh said to joseph in my dream i was standing on the bank of the nile when out of the river there came up seven cows fat and sleek and they grazed among the reeds after them seven other cows came up scrawny and very ugly and lean i had never seen such ugly cows in all the land of egypt the lean ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first but even after they ate them no one could tell that they had done so they looked just as ugly as before then i woke up in my dreams i also saw seven heads of grain full and good growing on a single stalk after them seven other heads sprouted withered and thin and scorched by the east wind the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads i told this to the magicians but none could explain it to me then joseph said to pharaoh the dreams of pharaoh are one and the same god has revealed to pharaoh what he is about to do the seven good cows are seven years and the seven good heads of grain are seven years it is one and the same dream the seven lean ugly cows that came up afterward are seven years and so are the seven worthless heads of grain scorched by the east wind they are seven years of famine it is just as i said to pharaoh god has shown pharaoh what he is about to do seven years of great abundance are coming throughout the land of egypt but seven years of famine will follow them then all the abundance in egypt will be forgotten and the famine will ravage the land the abundance in the land will not be remembered because the famine that follows it will be so severe the reason the dream was given to pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by god and god will do it soon and now let pharaoh look for a discerning and wise man and put him in charge of the land of egypt let pharaoh appoint commissioners over the land to take a fifth of the harvest of egypt during the seven years of abundance they should collect all the food of these good years that are coming and store up the grain under the authority of pharaoh to be kept in the cities for food this food should be held in reserve for the country to be used during the seven years of famine that will come upon egypt so that the country may not be ruined by the famine the plan seemed good to pharaoh and to all his officials so pharaoh asked them can we find anyone like this man one in whom is the spirit of god then pharaoh said to joseph since god has made all this known to you there is no one so discerning and wise as you you shall be in charge of my palace and all my people are to submit to your orders only with respect to the throne will i be greater than you so pharaoh said to joseph i hereby put you in charge of the whole land of egypt then pharaoh took his signet ring from his finger and put it on josephs finger he dressed him in robes of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck he had him ride in a chariot as his second in command and men shouted before him make way thus he put him in charge of the whole land of egypt then pharaoh said to joseph i am pharaoh but without your word no one will lift hand or foot in all egypt pharaoh gave joseph the name zaphenath paneah and gave him asenath daughter of potiphera priest of on to be his wife and joseph went throughout the land of egypt joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of pharaoh king of egypt and joseph went out from pharaohs presence and traveled throughout egypt during the seven years of abundance the land produced plentifully joseph collected all the food produced in those seven years of abundance in egypt and stored it in the cities in each city he put the food grown in the fields surrounding it joseph stored up huge quantities of grain like the sand of the sea it was so much that he stopped keeping records because it was beyond measure before the years of famine came two sons were born to joseph by asenath daughter of potiphera priest of on joseph named his firstborn manasseh and said it is because god has made me forget all my trouble and all my fathers household the second son he named ephraim and said it is because god has made me fruitful in the land of my suffering the seven years of abundance in egypt came to an end and the seven years of famine began just as joseph had said there was famine in all the other lands but in the whole land of egypt there was food when all egypt began to feel the famine the people cried to pharaoh for food then pharaoh told all the egyptians go to joseph and do what he tells you when the famine had spread over the whole country joseph opened the storehouses and sold grain to the egyptians for the famine was severe throughout egypt and all the countries came to egypt to buy grain from joseph because the famine was severe in all the world when jacob learned that there was grain in egypt he said to his sons why do you just keep looking at each other he continued i have heard that there is grain in egypt go down there and buy some for us so that we may live and not die then ten of josephs brothers went down to buy grain from egypt but jacob did not send benjamin josephs brother with the others because he was afraid that harm might come to him so israels sons were among those who went to buy grain for the famine was in the land of canaan also now joseph was the governor of the land the one who sold grain to all its people so when josephs brothers arrived they bowed down to him with their faces to the ground as soon as joseph saw his brothers he recognized them but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them where do you come from he asked from the land of canaan they replied to buy food although joseph recognized his brothers they did not recognize him then he remembered his dreams about them and said to them you are spies you have come to see where our land is unprotected no my lord they answered your servants have come to buy food we are all the sons of one man your servants are honest men not spies no he said to them you have come to see where our land is unprotected but they replied your servants were twelve brothers the sons of one man who lives in the land of canaan the youngest is now with our father and one is no more joseph said to them it is just as i told you you are spies and this is how you will be tested as surely as pharaoh lives you will not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here send one of your number to get your brother the rest of you will be kept in prison so that your words may be tested to see if you are telling the truth if you are not then as surely as pharaoh lives you are spies and he put them all in custody for three days on the third day joseph said to them do this and you will live for i fear god if you are honest men let one of your brothers stay here in prison while the rest of you go and take grain back for your starving households but you must bring your youngest brother to me so that your words may be verified and that you may not die this they proceeded to do they said to one another surely we are being punished because of our brother we saw how distressed he was when he pleaded with us for his life but we would not listen thats why this distress has come upon us reuben replied didnt i tell you not to sin against the boy but you wouldnt listen now we must give an accounting for his blood they did not realize that joseph could understand them since he was using an interpreter he turned away from them and began to weep but then turned back and spoke to them again he had simeon taken from them and bound before their eyes joseph gave orders to fill their bags with grain to put each mans silver back in his sack and to give them provisions for their journey after this was done for them they loaded their grain on their donkeys and left at the place where they stopped for the night one of them opened his sack to get feed for his donkey and he saw his silver in the mouth of his sack my silver has been returned he said to his brothers here it is in my sack their hearts sank and they turned to each other trembling and said what is this that god has done to us when they came to their father jacob in the land of canaan they told him all that had happened to them they said the man who is lord over the land spoke harshly to us and treated us as though we were spying on the land but we said to him we are honest men we are not spies we were twelve brothers sons of one father one is no more and the youngest is now with our father in canaan then the man who is lord over the land said to us this is how i will know whether you are honest men leave one of your brothers here with me and take food for your starving households and go but bring your youngest brother to me so i will know that you are not spies but honest men then i will give your brother back to you and you can trade in the land as they were emptying their sacks there in each mans sack was his pouch of silver when they and their father saw the money pouches they were frightened their father jacob said to them you have deprived me of my children joseph is no more and simeon is no more and now you want to take benjamin everything is against me then reuben said to his father you may put both of my sons to death if i do not bring him back to you entrust him to my care and i will bring him back but jacob said my son will not go down there with you his brother is dead and he is the only one left if harm comes to him on the journey you are taking you will bring my gray head down to the grave in sorrow now the famine was still severe in the land so when they had eaten all the grain they had brought from egypt their father said to them go back and buy us a little more food but judah said to him the man warned us solemnly you will not see my face again unless your brother is with you if you will send our brother along with us we will go down and buy food for you but if you will not send him we will not go down because the man said to us you will not see my face again unless your brother is with you israel asked why did you bring this trouble on me by telling the man you had another brother they replied the man questioned us closely about ourselves and our family is your father still living he asked us do you have another brother we simply answered his questions how were we to know he would say bring your brother down here then judah said to israel his father send the boy along with me and we will go at once so that we and you and our children may live and not die i myself will guarantee his safety you can hold me personally responsible for him if i do not bring him back to you and set him here before you i will bear the blame before you all my life as it is if we had not delayed we could have gone and returned twice then their father israel said to them if it must be then do this put some of the best products of the land in your bags and take them down to the man as a gift a little balm and a little honey some spices and myrrh some pistachio nuts and almonds take double the amount of silver with you for you must return the silver that was put back into the mouths of your sacks perhaps it was a mistake take your brother also and go back to the man at once and may god almighty grant you mercy before the man so that he will let your other brother and benjamin come back with you as for me if i am bereaved i am bereaved so the men took the gifts and double the amount of silver and benjamin also they hurried down to egypt and presented themselves to joseph when joseph saw benjamin with them he said to the steward of his house take these men to my house slaughter an animal and prepare dinner they are to eat with me at noon the man did as joseph told him and took the men to josephs house now the men were frightened when they were taken to his house they thought we were brought here because of the silver that was put back into our sacks the first time he wants to attack us and overpower us and seize us as slaves and take our donkeys so they went up to josephs steward and spoke to him at the entrance to the house please sir they said we came down here the first time to buy food but at the place where we stopped for the night we opened our sacks and each of us found his silver the exact weight in the mouth of his sack so we have brought it back with us we have also brought additional silver with us to buy food we dont know who put our silver in our sacks its all right he said dont be afraid your god the god of your father has given you treasure in your sacks i received your silver then he brought simeon out to them the steward took the men into josephs house gave them water to wash their feet and provided fodder for their donkeys they prepared their gifts for josephs arrival at noon because they had heard that they were to eat there when joseph came home they presented to him the gifts they had brought into the house and they bowed down before him to the ground he asked them how they were and then he said how is your aged father you told me about is he still living they replied your servant our father is still alive and well and they bowed low to pay him honor as he looked about and saw his brother benjamin his own mothers son he asked is this your youngest brother the one you told me about and he said god be gracious to you my son deeply moved at the sight of his brother joseph hurried out and looked for a place to weep he went into his private room and wept there after he had washed his face he came out and controlling himself said serve the food they served him by himself the brothers by themselves and the egyptians who ate with him by themselves because egyptians could not eat with hebrews for that is detestable to egyptians the men had been seated before him in the order of their ages from the firstborn to the youngest and they looked at each other in astonishment when portions were served to them from josephs table benjamins portion was five times as much as anyone elses so they feasted and drank freely with him now joseph gave these instructions to the steward of his house fill the mens sacks with as much food as they can carry and put each mans silver in the mouth of his sack then put my cup the silver one in the mouth of the youngest ones sack along with the silver for his grain and he did as joseph said as morning dawned the men were sent on their way with their donkeys they had not gone far from the city when joseph said to his steward go after those men at once and when you catch up with them say to them why have you repaid good with evil isnt this the cup my master drinks from and also uses for divination this is a wicked thing you have done when he caught up with them he repeated these words to them but they said to him why does my lord say such things far be it from your servants to do anything like that we even brought back to you from the land of canaan the silver we found inside the mouths of our sacks so why would we steal silver or gold from your masters house if any of your servants is found to have it he will die and the rest of us will become my lords slaves very well then he said let it be as you say whoever is found to have it will become my slave the rest of you will be free from blame each of them quickly lowered his sack to the ground and opened it then the steward proceeded to search beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest and the cup was found in benjamins sack at this they tore their clothes then they all loaded their donkeys and returned to the city joseph was still in the house when judah and his brothers came in and they threw themselves to the ground before him joseph said to them what is this you have done dont you know that a man like me can find things out by divination what can we say to my lord judah replied what can we say how can we prove our innocence god has uncovered your servants guilt we are now my lords slaves we ourselves and the one who was found to have the cup but joseph said far be it from me to do such a thing only the man who was found to have the cup will become my slave the rest of you go back to your father in peace then judah went up to him and said please my lord let your servant speak a word to my lord do not be angry with your servant though you are equal to pharaoh himself my lord asked his servants do you have a father or a brother and we answered we have an aged father and there is a young son born to him in his old age his brother is dead and he is the only one of his mothers sons left and his father loves him then you said to your servants bring him down to me so i can see him for myself and we said to my lord the boy cannot leave his father if he leaves him his father will die but you told your servants unless your youngest brother comes down with you you will not see my face again when we went back to your servant my father we told him what my lord had said then our father said go back and buy a little more food but we said we cannot go down only if our youngest brother is with us will we go we cannot see the mans face unless our youngest brother is with us your servant my father said to us you know that my wife bore me two sons one of them went away from me and i said he has surely been torn to pieces and i have not seen him since if you take this one from me too and harm comes to him you will bring my gray head down to the grave in misery so now if the boy is not with us when i go back to your servant my father and if my father whose life is closely bound up with the boys life sees that the boy isnt there he will die your servants will bring the gray head of our father down to the grave in sorrow your servant guaranteed the boys safety to my father i said if i do not bring him back to you i will bear the blame before you my father all my life now then please let your servant remain here as my lords slave in place of the boy and let the boy return with his brothers how can i go back to my father if the boy is not with me no do not let me see the misery that would come upon my father then joseph could no longer control himself before all his attendants and he cried out have everyone leave my presence so there was no one with joseph when he made himself known to his brothers and he wept so loudly that the egyptians heard him and pharaohs household heard about it joseph said to his brothers i am joseph is my father still living but his brothers were not able to answer him because they were terrified at his presence then joseph said to his brothers come close to me when they had done so he said i am your brother joseph the one you sold into egypt and now do not be distressed and do not be angry with yourselves for selling me here because it was to save lives that god sent me ahead of you for two years now there has been famine in the land and for the next five years there will not be plowing and reaping but god sent me ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance so then it was not you who sent me here but god he made me father to pharaoh lord of his entire household and ruler of all egypt now hurry back to my father and say to him this is what your son joseph says god has made me lord of all egypt come down to me dont delay you shall live in the region of goshen and be near me you your children and grandchildren your flocks and herds and all you have i will provide for you there because five years of famine are still to come otherwise you and your household and all who belong to you will become destitute you can see for yourselves and so can my brother benjamin that it is really i who am speaking to you tell my father about all the honor accorded me in egypt and about everything you have seen and bring my father down here quickly then he threw his arms around his brother benjamin and wept and benjamin embraced him weeping and he kissed all his brothers and wept over them afterward his brothers talked with him when the news reached pharaohs palace that josephs brothers had come pharaoh and all his officials were pleased pharaoh said to joseph tell your brothers do this load your animals and return to the land of canaan and bring your father and your families back to me i will give you the best of the land of egypt and you can enjoy the fat of the land you are also directed to tell them do this take some carts from egypt for your children and your wives and get your father and come never mind about your belongings because the best of all egypt will be yours so the sons of israel did this joseph gave them carts as pharaoh had commanded and he also gave them provisions for their journey to each of them he gave new clothing but to benjamin he gave three hundred shekels of silver and five sets of clothes and this is what he sent to his father ten donkeys loaded with the best things of egypt and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other provisions for his journey then he sent his brothers away and as they were leaving he said to them dont quarrel on the way so they went up out of egypt and came to their father jacob in the land of canaan they told him joseph is still alive in fact he is ruler of all egypt jacob was stunned he did not believe them but when they told him everything joseph had said to them and when he saw the carts joseph had sent to carry him back the spirit of their father jacob revived and israel said im convinced my son joseph is still alive i will go and see him before i die so israel set out with all that was his and when he reached beersheba he offered sacrifices to the god of his father isaac and god spoke to israel in a vision at night and said jacob jacobhere i am he replied i am god the god of your father he said do not be afraid to go down to egypt for i will make you into a great nation there i will go down to egypt with you and i will surely bring you back again and josephs own hand will close your eyes then jacob left beersheba and israels sons took their father jacob and their children and their wives in the carts that pharaoh had sent to transport him they also took with them their livestock and the possessions they had acquired in canaan and jacob and all his offspring went to egypt he took with him to egypt his sons and grandsons and his daughters and granddaughters all his offspring these are the names of the sons of israel jacob and his descendants who went to egypt reuben the firstborn of jacob the sons of reuben hanoch pallu hezron and carmi the sons of simeon jemuel jamin ohad jakin zohar and shaul the son of a canaanite woman the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari the sons of judah er onan shelah perez and zerah but er and onan had died in the land of canaan the sons of perez hezron and hamul the sons of issachar tola puah jashub and shimron the sons of zebulun sered elon and jahleel these were the sons leah bore to jacob in paddan aram besides his daughter dinah these sons and daughters of his were thirty three in all the sons of gad zephon haggi shuni ezbon eri arodi and areli the sons of asher imnah ishvah ishvi and beriah their sister was serah the sons of beriah heber and malkiel these were the children born to jacob by zilpah whom laban had given to his daughter leah sixteen in all the sons of jacobs wife rachel joseph and benjamin in egypt manasseh and ephraim were born to joseph by asenath daughter of potiphera priest of on the sons of benjamin bela beker ashbel gera naaman ehi rosh muppim huppim and ard these were the sons of rachel who were born to jacob fourteen in all the son of dan hushim the sons of naphtali jahziel guni jezer and shillem these were the sons born to jacob by bilhah whom laban had given to his daughter rachel seven in all all those who went to egypt with jacob those who were his direct descendants not counting his sons wives numbered sixty six persons with the two sons who had been born to joseph in egypt the members of jacobs family which went to egypt were seventy in all now jacob sent judah ahead of him to joseph to get directions to goshen when they arrived in the region of goshen joseph had his chariot made ready and went to goshen to meet his father israel as soon as joseph appeared before him he threw his arms around his father and wept for a long time israel said to joseph now i am ready to die since i have seen for myself that you are still alive then joseph said to his brothers and to his fathers household i will go up and speak to pharaoh and will say to him my brothers and my fathers household who were living in the land of canaan have come to me the men are shepherds they tend livestock and they have brought along their flocks and herds and everything they own when pharaoh calls you in and asks what is your occupation you should answer your servants have tended livestock from our boyhood on just as our fathers did then you will be allowed to settle in the region of goshen for all shepherds are detestable to the egyptians joseph went and told pharaoh my father and brothers with their flocks and herds and everything they own have come from the land of canaan and are now in goshen he chose five of his brothers and presented them before pharaoh pharaoh asked the brothers what is your occupationyour servants are shepherds they replied to pharaoh just as our fathers were they also said to him we have come to live here awhile because the famine is severe in canaan and your servants flocks have no pasture so now please let your servants settle in goshen pharaoh said to joseph your father and your brothers have come to you and the land of egypt is before you settle your father and your brothers in the best part of the land let them live in goshen and if you know of any among them with special ability put them in charge of my own livestock then joseph brought his father jacob in and presented him before pharaoh after jacob blessed pharaoh pharaoh asked him how old are you and jacob said to pharaoh the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty my years have been few and difficult and they do not equal the years of the pilgrimage of my fathers then jacob blessed pharaoh and went out from his presence so joseph settled his father and his brothers in egypt and gave them property in the best part of the land the district of rameses as pharaoh directed joseph also provided his father and his brothers and all his fathers household with food according to the number of their children there was no food however in the whole region because the famine was severe both egypt and canaan wasted away because of the famine joseph collected all the money that was to be found in egypt and canaan in payment for the grain they were buying and he brought it to pharaohs palace when the money of the people of egypt and canaan was gone all egypt came to joseph and said give us food why should we die before your eyes our money is used up then bring your livestock said joseph i will sell you food in exchange for your livestock since your money is gone so they brought their livestock to joseph and he gave them food in exchange for their horses their sheep and goats their cattle and donkeys and he brought them through that year with food in exchange for all their livestock when that year was over they came to him the following year and said we cannot hide from our lord the fact that since our money is gone and our livestock belongs to you there is nothing left for our lord except our bodies and our land why should we perish before your eyes we and our land as well buy us and our land in exchange for food and we with our land will be in bondage to pharaoh give us seed so that we may live and not die and that the land may not become desolate so joseph bought all the land in egypt for pharaoh the egyptians one and all sold their fields because the famine was too severe for them the land became pharaohs and joseph reduced the people to servitude from one end of egypt to the other however he did not buy the land of the priests because they received a regular allotment from pharaoh and had food enough from the allotment pharaoh gave them that is why they did not sell their land joseph said to the people now that i have bought you and your land today for pharaoh here is seed for you so you can plant the ground but when the crop comes in give a fifth of it to pharaoh the other four fifths you may keep as seed for the fields and as food for yourselves and your households and your children you have saved our lives they said may we find favor in the eyes of our lord we will be in bondage to pharaoh so joseph established it as a law concerning land in egypt still in force today that a fifth of the produce belongs to pharaoh it was only the land of the priests that did not become pharaohs now the israelites settled in egypt in the region of goshen they acquired property there and were fruitful and increased greatly in number jacob lived in egypt seventeen years and the years of his life were a hundred and forty seven when the time drew near for israel to die he called for his son joseph and said to him if i have found favor in your eyes put your hand under my thigh and promise that you will show me kindness and faithfulness do not bury me in egypt but when i rest with my fathers carry me out of egypt and bury me where they are buriedi will do as you say he said swear to me he said then joseph swore to him and israel worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff some time later joseph was told your father is ill so he took his two sons manasseh and ephraim along with him when jacob was told your son joseph has come to you israel rallied his strength and sat up on the bed jacob said to joseph god almighty appeared to me at luz in the land of canaan and there he blessed me and said to me i am going to make you fruitful and will increase your numbers i will make you a community of peoples and i will give this land as an everlasting possession to your descendants after you now then your two sons born to you in egypt before i came to you here will be reckoned as mine ephraim and manasseh will be mine just as reuben and simeon are mine any children born to you after them will be yours in the territory they inherit they will be reckoned under the names of their brothers as i was returning from paddan to my sorrow rachel died in the land of canaan while we were still on the way a little distance from ephrath so i buried her there beside the road to ephrath that is bethlehem when israel saw the sons of joseph he asked who are these they are the sons god has given me here joseph said to his father then israel said bring them to me so i may bless them now israels eyes were failing because of old age and he could hardly see so joseph brought his sons close to him and his father kissed them and embraced them israel said to joseph i never expected to see your face again and now god has allowed me to see your children too then joseph removed them from israels knees and bowed down with his face to the ground and joseph took both of them ephraim on his right toward israels left hand and manasseh on his left toward israels right hand and brought them close to him but israel reached out his right hand and put it on ephraims head though he was the younger and crossing his arms he put his left hand on manassehs head even though manasseh was the firstborn then he blessed joseph and said may the god before whom my fathers abraham and isaac walked the god who has been my shepherd all my life to this day the angel who has delivered me from all harm may he bless these boys may they be called by my name and the names of my fathers abraham and isaac and may they increase greatly upon the earth when joseph saw his father placing his right hand on ephraims head he was displeased so he took hold of his fathers hand to move it from ephraims head to manassehs head joseph said to him no my father this one is the firstborn put your right hand on his head but his father refused and said i know my son i know he too will become a people and he too will become great nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he and his descendants will become a group of nations he blessed them that day and said in your name will israel pronounce this blessing may god make you like ephraim and manasseh so he put ephraim ahead of manasseh then israel said to joseph i am about to die but god will be with you and take you back to the land of your fathers and to you as one who is over your brothers i give the ridge of land i took from the amorites with my sword and my bow then jacob called for his sons and said gather around so i can tell you what will happen to you in days to come assemble and listen sons of jacob listen to your father israel reuben you are my firstborn my might the first sign of my strength excelling in honor excelling in power turbulent as the waters you will no longer excel for you went up onto your fathers bed onto my couch and defiled it simeon and levi are brothers their swords are weapons of violence let me not enter their council let me not join their assembly for they have killed men in their anger and hamstrung oxen as they pleased cursed be their anger so fierce and their fury so cruel i will scatter them in jacob and disperse them in israel judah your brothers will praise you your hand will be on the neck of your enemies your fathers sons will bow down to you you are a lions cub o judah you return from the prey my son like a lion he crouches and lies down like a lioness who dares to rouse him the scepter will not depart from judah nor the rulers staff from between his feet until he comes to whom it belongs and the obedience of the nations is his he will tether his donkey to a vine his colt to the choicest branch he will wash his garments in wine his robes in the blood of grapes his eyes will be darker than wine his teeth whiter than milk zebulun will live by the seashore and become a haven for ships his border will extend toward sidon issachar is a rawboned donkey lying down between two saddlebags when he sees how good is his resting place and how pleasant is his land he will bend his shoulder to the burden and submit to forced labor dan will provide justice for his people as one of the tribes of israel dan will be a serpent by the roadside a viper along the path that bites the horses heels so that its rider tumbles backward i look for your deliverance o lord gad will be attacked by a band of raiders but he will attack them at their heels ashers food will be rich he will provide delicacies fit for a king naphtali is a doe set free that bears beautiful fawns joseph is a fruitful vine a fruitful vine near a spring whose branches climb over a wall with bitterness archers attacked him they shot at him with hostility but his bow remained steady his strong arms stayed limber because of the hand of the mighty one of jacob because of the shepherd the rock of israel because of your fathers god who helps you because of the almighty who blesses you with blessings of the heavens above blessings of the deep that lies below blessings of the breast and womb your fathers blessings are greater than the blessings of the ancient mountains than the bounty of the age old hills let all these rest on the head of joseph on the brow of the prince among his brothers benjamin is a ravenous wolf in the morning he devours the prey in the evening he divides the plunder all these are the twelve tribes of israel and this is what their father said to them when he blessed them giving each the blessing appropriate to him then he gave them these instructions i am about to be gathered to my people bury me with my fathers in the cave in the field of ephron the hittite the cave in the field of machpelah near mamre in canaan which abraham bought as a burial place from ephron the hittite along with the field there abraham and his wife sarah were buried there isaac and his wife rebekah were buried and there i buried leah the field and the cave in it were bought from the hittites when jacob had finished giving instructions to his sons he drew his feet up into the bed breathed his last and was gathered to his people joseph threw himself upon his father and wept over him and kissed him then joseph directed the physicians in his service to embalm his father israel so the physicians embalmed him taking a full forty days for that was the time required for embalming and the egyptians mourned for him seventy days when the days of mourning had passed joseph said to pharaohs court if i have found favor in your eyes speak to pharaoh for me tell him my father made me swear an oath and said i am about to die bury me in the tomb i dug for myself in the land of canaan now let me go up and bury my father then i will return pharaoh said go up and bury your father as he made you swear to do so joseph went up to bury his father all pharaohs officials accompanied him the dignitaries of his court and all the dignitaries of egypt besides all the members of josephs household and his brothers and those belonging to his fathers household only their children and their flocks and herds were left in goshen chariots and horsemen also went up with him it was a very large company when they reached the threshing floor of atad near the jordan they lamented loudly and bitterly and there joseph observed a seven day period of mourning for his father when the canaanites who lived there saw the mourning at the threshing floor of atad they said the egyptians are holding a solemn ceremony of mourning that is why that place near the jordan is called abel mizraim so jacobs sons did as he had commanded them they carried him to the land of canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of machpelah near mamre which abraham had bought as a burial place from ephron the hittite along with the field after burying his father joseph returned to egypt together with his brothers and all the others who had gone with him to bury his father when josephs brothers saw that their father was dead they said what if joseph holds a grudge against us and pays us back for all the wrongs we did to him so they sent word to joseph saying your father left these instructions before he died this is what you are to say to joseph i ask you to forgive your brothers the sins and the wrongs they committed in treating you so badly now please forgive the sins of the servants of the god of your father when their message came to him joseph wept his brothers then came and threw themselves down before him we are your slaves they said but joseph said to them dont be afraid am i in the place of god you intended to harm me but god intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done the saving of many lives so then dont be afraid i will provide for you and your children and he reassured them and spoke kindly to them joseph stayed in egypt along with all his fathers family he lived a hundred and ten years and saw the third generation of ephraims children also the children of makir son of manasseh were placed at birth on josephs knees then joseph said to his brothers i am about to die but god will surely come to your aid and take you up out of this land to the land he promised on oath to abraham isaac and jacob and joseph made the sons of israel swear an oath and said god will surely come to your aid and then you must carry my bones up from this place so joseph died at the age of a hundred and ten and after they embalmed him he was placed in a coffin in egypt  these are the names of the sons of israel who went to egypt with jacob each with his family reuben simeon levi and judah issachar zebulun and benjamin dan and naphtali gad and asher the descendants of jacob numbered seventy in all joseph was already in egypt now joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died but the israelites were fruitful and multiplied greatly and became exceedingly numerous so that the land was filled with them then a new king who did not know about joseph came to power in egypt look he said to his people the israelites have become much too numerous for us come we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and if war breaks out will join our enemies fight against us and leave the country so they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labor and they built pithom and rameses as store cities for pharaoh but the more they were oppressed the more they multiplied and spread so the egyptians came to dread the israelites and worked them ruthlessly they made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields in all their hard labor the egyptians used them ruthlessly the king of egypt said to the hebrew midwives whose names were shiphrah and puah when you help the hebrew women in childbirth and observe them on the delivery stool if it is a boy kill him but if it is a girl let her live the midwives however feared god and did not do what the king of egypt had told them to do they let the boys live then the king of egypt summoned the midwives and asked them why have you done this why have you let the boys live the midwives answered pharaoh hebrew women are not like egyptian women they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive so god was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous and because the midwives feared god he gave them families of their own then pharaoh gave this order to all his people every boy that is born you must throw into the nile but let every girl live now a man of the house of levi married a levite woman and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son when she saw that he was a fine child she hid him for three months but when she could hide him no longer she got a papyrus basket for him and coated it with tar and pitch then she placed the child in it and put it among the reeds along the bank of the nile his sister stood at a distance to see what would happen to him then pharaohs daughter went down to the nile to bathe and her attendants were walking along the river bank she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her slave girl to get it she opened it and saw the baby he was crying and she felt sorry for him this is one of the hebrew babies she said then his sister asked pharaohs daughter shall i go and get one of the hebrew women to nurse the baby for you yes go she answered and the girl went and got the babys mother pharaohs daughter said to her take this baby and nurse him for me and i will pay you so the woman took the baby and nursed him when the child grew older she took him to pharaohs daughter and he became her son she named him moses saying i drew him out of the water one day after moses had grown up he went out to where his own people were and watched them at their hard labor he saw an egyptian beating a hebrew one of his own people glancing this way and that and seeing no one he killed the egyptian and hid him in the sand the next day he went out and saw two hebrews fighting he asked the one in the wrong why are you hitting your fellow hebrew the man said who made you ruler and judge over us are you thinking of killing me as you killed the egyptian then moses was afraid and thought what i did must have become known when pharaoh heard of this he tried to kill moses but moses fled from pharaoh and went to live in midian where he sat down by a well now a priest of midian had seven daughters and they came to draw water and fill the troughs to water their fathers flock some shepherds came along and drove them away but moses got up and came to their rescue and watered their flock when the girls returned to reuel their father he asked them why have you returned so early today they answered an egyptian rescued us from the shepherds he even drew water for us and watered the flock and where is he he asked his daughters why did you leave him invite him to have something to eat moses agreed to stay with the man who gave his daughter zipporah to moses in marriage zipporah gave birth to a son and moses named him gershom saying i have become an alien in a foreign land during that long period the king of egypt died the israelites groaned in their slavery and cried out and their cry for help because of their slavery went up to god god heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob so god looked on the israelites and was concerned about them now moses was tending the flock of jethro his father in law the priest of midian and he led the flock to the far side of the desert and came to horeb the mountain of god there the angel of the lord appeared to him in flames of fire from within a bush moses saw that though the bush was on fire it did not burn up so moses thought i will go over and see this strange sight why the bush does not burn up when the lord saw that he had gone over to look god called to him from within the bush moses moses and moses said here i am do not come any closer god said take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy ground then he said i am the god of your father the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob at this moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at god the lord said i have indeed seen the misery of my people in egypt i have heard them crying out because of their slave drivers and i am concerned about their suffering so i have come down to rescue them from the hand of the egyptians and to bring them up out of that land into a good and spacious land a land flowing with milk and honey the home of the canaanites hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites and now the cry of the israelites has reached me and i have seen the way the egyptians are oppressing them so now go i am sending you to pharaoh to bring my people the israelites out of egypt but moses said to god who am i that i should go to pharaoh and bring the israelites out of egypt and god said i will be with you and this will be the sign to you that it is i who have sent you when you have brought the people out of egypt you will worship god on this mountain moses said to god suppose i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name then what shall i tell them god said to moses i am who i am this is what you are to say to the israelites i am has sent me to you god also said to moses say to the israelites the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has sent me to you this is my name forever the name by which i am to be remembered from generation to generation go assemble the elders of israel and say to them the lord the god of your fathers the god of abraham isaac and jacob appeared to me and said i have watched over you and have seen what has been done to you in egypt and i have promised to bring you up out of your misery in egypt into the land of the canaanites hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites a land flowing with milk and honey the elders of israel will listen to you then you and the elders are to go to the king of egypt and say to him the lord the god of the hebrews has met with us let us take a three day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the lord our god but i know that the king of egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand compels him so i will stretch out my hand and strike the egyptians with all the wonders that i will perform among them after that he will let you go and i will make the egyptians favorably disposed toward this people so that when you leave you will not go empty handed every woman is to ask her neighbor and any woman living in her house for articles of silver and gold and for clothing which you will put on your sons and daughters and so you will plunder the egyptians moses answered what if they do not believe me or listen to me and say the lord did not appear to you then the lord said to him what is that in your handa staff he replied the lord said throw it on the ground moses threw it on the ground and it became a snake and he ran from it then the lord said to him reach out your hand and take it by the tail so moses reached out and took hold of the snake and it turned back into a staff in his hand this said the lord is so that they may believe that the lord the god of their fathers the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob has appeared to you then the lord said put your hand inside your cloak so moses put his hand into his cloak and when he took it out it was leprous like snow now put it back into your cloak he said so moses put his hand back into his cloak and when he took it out it was restored like the rest of his flesh then the lord said if they do not believe you or pay attention to the first miraculous sign they may believe the second but if they do not believe these two signs or listen to you take some water from the nile and pour it on the dry ground the water you take from the river will become blood on the ground moses said to the lord o lord i have never been eloquent neither in the past nor since you have spoken to your servant i am slow of speech and tongue the lord said to him who gave man his mouth who makes him deaf or mute who gives him sight or makes him blind is it not i the lord now go i will help you speak and will teach you what to say but moses said o lord please send someone else to do it then the lords anger burned against moses and he said what about your brother aaron the levite i know he can speak well he is already on his way to meet you and his heart will be glad when he sees you you shall speak to him and put words in his mouth i will help both of you speak and will teach you what to do he will speak to the people for you and it will be as if he were your mouth and as if you were god to him but take this staff in your hand so you can perform miraculous signs with it then moses went back to jethro his father in law and said to him let me go back to my own people in egypt to see if any of them are still alive jethro said go and i wish you well now the lord had said to moses in midian go back to egypt for all the men who wanted to kill you are dead so moses took his wife and sons put them on a donkey and started back to egypt and he took the staff of god in his hand the lord said to moses when you return to egypt see that you perform before pharaoh all the wonders i have given you the power to do but i will harden his heart so that he will not let the people go then say to pharaoh this is what the lord says israel is my firstborn son and i told you let my son go so he may worship me but you refused to let him go so i will kill your firstborn son at a lodging place on the way the lord met {moses} and was about to kill him but zipporah took a flint knife cut off her sons foreskin and touched {moses} feet with it surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me she said so the lord let him alone at that time she said bridegroom of blood referring to circumcision the lord said to aaron go into the desert to meet moses so he met moses at the mountain of god and kissed him then moses told aaron everything the lord had sent him to say and also about all the miraculous signs he had commanded him to perform moses and aaron brought together all the elders of the israelites and aaron told them everything the lord had said to moses he also performed the signs before the people and they believed and when they heard that the lord was concerned about them and had seen their misery they bowed down and worshiped afterward moses and aaron went to pharaoh and said this is what the lord the god of israel says let my people go so that they may hold a festival to me in the desert pharaoh said who is the lord that i should obey him and let israel go i do not know the lord and i will not let israel go then they said the god of the hebrews has met with us now let us take a three day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the lord our god or he may strike us with plagues or with the sword but the king of egypt said moses and aaron why are you taking the people away from their labor get back to your work then pharaoh said look the people of the land are now numerous and you are stopping them from working that same day pharaoh gave this order to the slave drivers and foremen in charge of the people you are no longer to supply the people with straw for making bricks let them go and gather their own straw but require them to make the same number of bricks as before dont reduce the quota they are lazy that is why they are crying out let us go and sacrifice to our god make the work harder for the men so that they keep working and pay no attention to lies then the slave drivers and the foremen went out and said to the people this is what pharaoh says i will not give you any more straw go and get your own straw wherever you can find it but your work will not be reduced at all so the people scattered all over egypt to gather stubble to use for straw the slave drivers kept pressing them saying complete the work required of you for each day just as when you had straw the israelite foremen appointed by pharaohs slave drivers were beaten and were asked why didnt you meet your quota of bricks yesterday or today as before then the israelite foremen went and appealed to pharaoh why have you treated your servants this way your servants are given no straw yet we are told make bricks your servants are being beaten but the fault is with your own people pharaoh said lazy thats what you are lazy that is why you keep saying let us go and sacrifice to the lord now get to work you will not be given any straw yet you must produce your full quota of bricks the israelite foremen realized they were in trouble when they were told you are not to reduce the number of bricks required of you for each day when they left pharaoh they found moses and aaron waiting to meet them and they said may the lord look upon you and judge you you have made us a stench to pharaoh and his officials and have put a sword in their hand to kill us moses returned to the lord and said o lord why have you brought trouble upon this people is this why you sent me ever since i went to pharaoh to speak in your name he has brought trouble upon this people and you have not rescued your people at all then the lord said to moses now you will see what i will do to pharaoh because of my mighty hand he will let them go because of my mighty hand he will drive them out of his country god also said to moses i am the lord i appeared to abraham to isaac and to jacob as god almighty but by my name the lord i did not make myself known to them i also established my covenant with them to give them the land of canaan where they lived as aliens moreover i have heard the groaning of the israelites whom the egyptians are enslaving and i have remembered my covenant therefore say to the israelites i am the lord and i will bring you out from under the yoke of the egyptians i will free you from being slaves to them and i will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with mighty acts of judgment i will take you as my own people and i will be your god then you will know that i am the lord your god who brought you out from under the yoke of the egyptians and i will bring you to the land i swore with uplifted hand to give to abraham to isaac and to jacob i will give it to you as a possession i am the lord moses reported this to the israelites but they did not listen to him because of their discouragement and cruel bondage then the lord said to moses go tell pharaoh king of egypt to let the israelites go out of his country but moses said to the lord if the israelites will not listen to me why would pharaoh listen to me since i speak with faltering lips now the lord spoke to moses and aaron about the israelites and pharaoh king of egypt and he commanded them to bring the israelites out of egypt these were the heads of their families the sons of reuben the firstborn son of israel were hanoch and pallu hezron and carmi these were the clans of reuben the sons of simeon were jemuel jamin ohad jakin zohar and shaul the son of a canaanite woman these were the clans of simeon these were the names of the sons of levi according to their records gershon kohath and merari levi lived 137 years the sons of gershon by clans were libni and shimei the sons of kohath were amram izhar hebron and uzziel kohath lived 133 years the sons of merari were mahli and mushi these were the clans of levi according to their records amram married his fathers sister jochebed who bore him aaron and moses amram lived 137 years the sons of izhar were korah nepheg and zicri the sons of uzziel were mishael elzaphan and sithri aaron married elisheba daughter of amminadab and sister of nahshon and she bore him nadab and abihu eleazar and ithamar the sons of korah were assir elkanah and abiasaph these were the korahite clans eleazar son of aaron married one of the daughters of putiel and she bore him phinehas these were the heads of the levite families clan by clan it was this same aaron and moses to whom the lord said bring the israelites out of egypt by their divisions they were the ones who spoke to pharaoh king of egypt about bringing the israelites out of egypt it was the same moses and aaron now when the lord spoke to moses in egypt he said to him i am the lord tell pharaoh king of egypt everything i tell you but moses said to the lord since i speak with faltering lips why would pharaoh listen to me then the lord said to moses see i have made you like god to pharaoh and your brother aaron will be your prophet you are to say everything i command you and your brother aaron is to tell pharaoh to let the israelites go out of his country but i will harden pharaohs heart and though i multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in egypt he will not listen to you then i will lay my hand on egypt and with mighty acts of judgment i will bring out my divisions my people the israelites and the egyptians will know that i am the lord when i stretch out my hand against egypt and bring the israelites out of it moses and aaron did just as the lord commanded them moses was eighty years old and aaron eighty three when they spoke to pharaoh the lord said to moses and aaron when pharaoh says to you perform a miracle then say to aaron take your staff and throw it down before pharaoh and it will become a snake so moses and aaron went to pharaoh and did just as the lord commanded aaron threw his staff down in front of pharaoh and his officials and it became a snake pharaoh then summoned wise men and sorcerers and the egyptian magicians also did the same things by their secret arts each one threw down his staff and it became a snake but aarons staff swallowed up their staffs yet pharaohs heart became hard and he would not listen to them just as the lord had said then the lord said to moses pharaohs heart is unyielding he refuses to let the people go go to pharaoh in the morning as he goes out to the water wait on the bank of the nile to meet him and take in your hand the staff that was changed into a snake then say to him the lord the god of the hebrews has sent me to say to you let my people go so that they may worship me in the desert but until now you have not listened this is what the lord says by this you will know that i am the lord with the staff that is in my hand i will strike the water of the nile and it will be changed into blood the fish in the nile will die and the river will stink the egyptians will not be able to drink its water the lord said to moses tell aaron take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of egypt over the streams and canals over the ponds and all the reservoirs and they will turn to blood blood will be everywhere in egypt even in the wooden buckets and stone jars moses and aaron did just as the lord had commanded he raised his staff in the presence of pharaoh and his officials and struck the water of the nile and all the water was changed into blood the fish in the nile died and the river smelled so bad that the egyptians could not drink its water blood was everywhere in egypt but the egyptian magicians did the same things by their secret arts and pharaohs heart became hard he would not listen to moses and aaron just as the lord had said instead he turned and went into his palace and did not take even this to heart and all the egyptians dug along the nile to get drinking water because they could not drink the water of the river seven days passed after the lord struck the nile then the lord said to moses go to pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship me if you refuse to let them go i will plague your whole country with frogs the nile will teem with frogs they will come up into your palace and your bedroom and onto your bed into the houses of your officials and on your people and into your ovens and kneading troughs the frogs will go up on you and your people and all your officials then the lord said to moses tell aaron stretch out your hand with your staff over the streams and canals and ponds and make frogs come up on the land of egypt so aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of egypt and the frogs came up and covered the land but the magicians did the same things by their secret arts they also made frogs come up on the land of egypt pharaoh summoned moses and aaron and said pray to the lord to take the frogs away from me and my people and i will let your people go to offer sacrifices to the lord moses said to pharaoh i leave to you the honor of setting the time for me to pray for you and your officials and your people that you and your houses may be rid of the frogs except for those that remain in the nile tomorrow pharaoh said moses replied it will be as you say so that you may know there is no one like the lord our god the frogs will leave you and your houses your officials and your people they will remain only in the nile after moses and aaron left pharaoh moses cried out to the lord about the frogs he had brought on pharaoh and the lord did what moses asked the frogs died in the houses in the courtyards and in the fields they were piled into heaps and the land reeked of them but when pharaoh saw that there was relief he hardened his heart and would not listen to moses and aaron just as the lord had said then the lord said to moses tell aaron stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground and throughout the land of egypt the dust will become gnats they did this and when aaron stretched out his hand with the staff and struck the dust of the ground gnats came upon men and animals all the dust throughout the land of egypt became gnats but when the magicians tried to produce gnats by their secret arts they could not and the gnats were on men and animals the magicians said to pharaoh this is the finger of god but pharaohs heart was hard and he would not listen just as the lord had said then the lord said to moses get up early in the morning and confront pharaoh as he goes to the water and say to him this is what the lord says let my people go so that they may worship me if you do not let my people go i will send swarms of flies on you and your officials on your people and into your houses the houses of the egyptians will be full of flies and even the ground where they are but on that day i will deal differently with the land of goshen where my people live no swarms of flies will be there so that you will know that i the lord am in this land i will make a distinction between my people and your people this miraculous sign will occur tomorrow and the lord did this dense swarms of flies poured into pharaohs palace and into the houses of his officials and throughout egypt the land was ruined by the flies then pharaoh summoned moses and aaron and said go sacrifice to your god here in the land but moses said that would not be right the sacrifices we offer the lord our god would be detestable to the egyptians and if we offer sacrifices that are detestable in their eyes will they not stone us we must take a three day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the lord our god as he commands us pharaoh said i will let you go to offer sacrifices to the lord your god in the desert but you must not go very far now pray for me moses answered as soon as i leave you i will pray to the lord and tomorrow the flies will leave pharaoh and his officials and his people only be sure that pharaoh does not act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the lord then moses left pharaoh and prayed to the lord and the lord did what moses asked the flies left pharaoh and his officials and his people not a fly remained but this time also pharaoh hardened his heart and would not let the people go then the lord said to moses go to pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may worship me if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them back the hand of the lord will bring a terrible plague on your livestock in the field on your horses and donkeys and camels and on your cattle and sheep and goats but the lord will make a distinction between the livestock of israel and that of egypt so that no animal belonging to the israelites will die the lord set a time and said tomorrow the lord will do this in the land and the next day the lord did it all the livestock of the egyptians died but not one animal belonging to the israelites died pharaoh sent men to investigate and found that not even one of the animals of the israelites had died yet his heart was unyielding and he would not let the people go then the lord said to moses and aaron take handfuls of soot from a furnace and have moses toss it into the air in the presence of pharaoh it will become fine dust over the whole land of egypt and festering boils will break out on men and animals throughout the land so they took soot from a furnace and stood before pharaoh moses tossed it into the air and festering boils broke out on men and animals the magicians could not stand before moses because of the boils that were on them and on all the egyptians but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not listen to moses and aaron just as the lord had said to moses then the lord said to moses get up early in the morning confront pharaoh and say to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says let my people go so that they may worship me or this time i will send the full force of my plagues against you and against your officials and your people so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth for by now i could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague that would have wiped you off the earth but i have raised you up for this very purpose that i might show you my power and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth you still set yourself against my people and will not let them go therefore at this time tomorrow i will send the worst hailstorm that has ever fallen on egypt from the day it was founded till now give an order now to bring your livestock and everything you have in the field to a place of shelter because the hail will fall on every man and animal that has not been brought in and is still out in the field and they will die those officials of pharaoh who feared the word of the lord hurried to bring their slaves and their livestock inside but those who ignored the word of the lord left their slaves and livestock in the field then the lord said to moses stretch out your hand toward the sky so that hail will fall all over egypt on men and animals and on everything growing in the fields of egypt when moses stretched out his staff toward the sky the lord sent thunder and hail and lightning flashed down to the ground so the lord rained hail on the land of egypt hail fell and lightning flashed back and forth it was the worst storm in all the land of egypt since it had become a nation throughout egypt hail struck everything in the fields both men and animals it beat down everything growing in the fields and stripped every tree the only place it did not hail was the land of goshen where the israelites were then pharaoh summoned moses and aaron this time i have sinned he said to them the lord is in the right and i and my people are in the wrong pray to the lord for we have had enough thunder and hail i will let you go you dont have to stay any longer moses replied when i have gone out of the city i will spread out my hands in prayer to the lord the thunder will stop and there will be no more hail so you may know that the earth is the lords but i know that you and your officials still do not fear the lord god the flax and barley were destroyed since the barley had headed and the flax was in bloom the wheat and spelt however were not destroyed because they ripen later then moses left pharaoh and went out of the city he spread out his hands toward the lord the thunder and hail stopped and the rain no longer poured down on the land when pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped he sinned again he and his officials hardened their hearts so pharaohs heart was hard and he would not let the israelites go just as the lord had said through moses then the lord said to moses go to pharaoh for i have hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials so that i may perform these miraculous signs of mine among them that you may tell your children and grandchildren how i dealt harshly with the egyptians and how i performed my signs among them and that you may know that i am the lord so moses and aaron went to pharaoh and said to him this is what the lord the god of the hebrews says how long will you refuse to humble yourself before me let my people go so that they may worship me if you refuse to let them go i will bring locusts into your country tomorrow they will cover the face of the ground so that it cannot be seen they will devour what little you have left after the hail including every tree that is growing in your fields they will fill your houses and those of all your officials and all the egyptians something neither your fathers nor your forefathers have ever seen from the day they settled in this land till now then moses turned and left pharaoh pharaohs officials said to him how long will this man be a snare to us let the people go so that they may worship the lord their god do you not yet realize that egypt is ruined then moses and aaron were brought back to pharaoh go worship the lord your god he said but just who will be going moses answered we will go with our young and old with our sons and daughters and with our flocks and herds because we are to celebrate a festival to the lord pharaoh said the lord be with you if i let you go along with your women and children clearly you are bent on evil no have only the men go and worship the lord since thats what you have been asking for then moses and aaron were driven out of pharaohs presence and the lord said to moses stretch out your hand over egypt so that locusts will swarm over the land and devour everything growing in the fields everything left by the hail so moses stretched out his staff over egypt and the lord made an east wind blow across the land all that day and all that night by morning the wind had brought the locusts they invaded all egypt and settled down in every area of the country in great numbers never before had there been such a plague of locusts nor will there ever be again they covered all the ground until it was black they devoured all that was left after the hail everything growing in the fields and the fruit on the trees nothing green remained on tree or plant in all the land of egypt pharaoh quickly summoned moses and aaron and said i have sinned against the lord your god and against you now forgive my sin once more and pray to the lord your god to take this deadly plague away from me moses then left pharaoh and prayed to the lord and the lord changed the wind to a very strong west wind which caught up the locusts and carried them into the red sea not a locust was left anywhere in egypt but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let the israelites go then the lord said to moses stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness will spread over egypt darkness that can be felt so moses stretched out his hand toward the sky and total darkness covered all egypt for three days no one could see anyone else or leave his place for three days yet all the israelites had light in the places where they lived then pharaoh summoned moses and said go worship the lord even your women and children may go with you only leave your flocks and herds behind but moses said you must allow us to have sacrifices and burnt offerings to present to the lord our god our livestock too must go with us not a hoof is to be left behind we have to use some of them in worshiping the lord our god and until we get there we will not know what we are to use to worship the lord but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he was not willing to let them go pharaoh said to moses get out of my sight make sure you do not appear before me again the day you see my face you will die just as you say moses replied i will never appear before you again now the lord had said to moses i will bring one more plague on pharaoh and on egypt after that he will let you go from here and when he does he will drive you out completely tell the people that men and women alike are to ask their neighbors for articles of silver and gold the lord made the egyptians favorably disposed toward the people and moses himself was highly regarded in egypt by pharaohs officials and by the people so moses said this is what the lord says about midnight i will go throughout egypt every firstborn son in egypt will die from the firstborn son of pharaoh who sits on the throne to the firstborn son of the slave girl who is at her hand mill and all the firstborn of the cattle as well there will be loud wailing throughout egypt worse than there has ever been or ever will be again but among the israelites not a dog will bark at any man or animal then you will know that the lord makes a distinction between egypt and israel all these officials of yours will come to me bowing down before me and saying go you and all the people who follow you after that i will leave then moses hot with anger left pharaoh the lord had said to moses pharaoh will refuse to listen to you so that my wonders may be multiplied in egypt moses and aaron performed all these wonders before pharaoh but the lord hardened pharaohs heart and he would not let the israelites go out of his country the lord said to moses and aaron in egypt this month is to be for you the first month the first month of your year tell the whole community of israel that on the tenth day of this month each man is to take a lamb for his family one for each household if any household is too small for a whole lamb they must share one with their nearest neighbor having taken into account the number of people there are you are to determine the amount of lamb needed in accordance with what each person will eat the animals you choose must be year old males without defect and you may take them from the sheep or the goats take care of them until the fourteenth day of the month when all the people of the community of israel must slaughter them at twilight then they are to take some of the blood and put it on the sides and tops of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the lambs that same night they are to eat the meat roasted over the fire along with bitter herbs and bread made without yeast do not eat the meat raw or cooked in water but roast it over the fire head legs and inner parts do not leave any of it till morning if some is left till morning you must burn it this is how you are to eat it with your cloak tucked into your belt your sandals on your feet and your staff in your hand eat it in haste it is the lords passover on that same night i will pass through egypt and strike down every firstborn both men and animals and i will bring judgment on all the gods of egypt i am the lord the blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you no destructive plague will touch you when i strike egypt this is a day you are to commemorate for the generations to come you shall celebrate it as a festival to the lord a lasting ordinance for seven days you are to eat bread made without yeast on the first day remove the yeast from your houses for whoever eats anything with yeast in it from the first day through the seventh must be cut off from israel on the first day hold a sacred assembly and another one on the seventh day do no work at all on these days except to prepare food for everyone to eat that is all you may do celebrate the feast of unleavened bread because it was on this very day that i brought your divisions out of egypt celebrate this day as a lasting ordinance for the generations to come in the first month you are to eat bread made without yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day until the evening of the twenty first day for seven days no yeast is to be found in your houses and whoever eats anything with yeast in it must be cut off from the community of israel whether he is an alien or native born eat nothing made with yeast wherever you live you must eat unleavened bread then moses summoned all the elders of israel and said to them go at once and select the animals for your families and slaughter the passover lamb take a bunch of hyssop dip it into the blood in the basin and put some of the blood on the top and on both sides of the doorframe not one of you shall go out the door of his house until morning when the lord goes through the land to strike down the egyptians he will see the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe and will pass over that doorway and he will not permit the destroyer to enter your houses and strike you down obey these instructions as a lasting ordinance for you and your descendants when you enter the land that the lord will give you as he promised observe this ceremony and when your children ask you what does this ceremony mean to you then tell them it is the passover sacrifice to the lord who passed over the houses of the israelites in egypt and spared our homes when he struck down the egyptians then the people bowed down and worshiped the israelites did just what the lord commanded moses and aaron at midnight the lord struck down all the firstborn in egypt from the firstborn of pharaoh who sat on the throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon and the firstborn of all the livestock as well pharaoh and all his officials and all the egyptians got up during the night and there was loud wailing in egypt for there was not a house without someone dead during the night pharaoh summoned moses and aaron and said up leave my people you and the israelites go worship the lord as you have requested take your flocks and herds as you have said and go and also bless me the egyptians urged the people to hurry and leave the country for otherwise they said we will all die so the people took their dough before the yeast was added and carried it on their shoulders in kneading troughs wrapped in clothing the israelites did as moses instructed and asked the egyptians for articles of silver and gold and for clothing the lord had made the egyptians favorably disposed toward the people and they gave them what they asked for so they plundered the egyptians the israelites journeyed from rameses to succoth there were about six hundred thousand men on foot besides women and children many other people went up with them as well as large droves of livestock both flocks and herds with the dough they had brought from egypt they baked cakes of unleavened bread the dough was without yeast because they had been driven out of egypt and did not have time to prepare food for themselves now the length of time the israelite people lived in egypt was 430 years at the end of the 430 years to the very day all the lords divisions left egypt because the lord kept vigil that night to bring them out of egypt on this night all the israelites are to keep vigil to honor the lord for the generations to come the lord said to moses and aaron these are the regulations for the passover no foreigner is to eat of it any slave you have bought may eat of it after you have circumcised him but a temporary resident and a hired worker may not eat of it it must be eaten inside one house take none of the meat outside the house do not break any of the bones the whole community of israel must celebrate it an alien living among you who wants to celebrate the lords passover must have all the males in his household circumcised then he may take part like one born in the land no uncircumcised male may eat of it the same law applies to the native born and to the alien living among you all the israelites did just what the lord had commanded moses and aaron and on that very day the lord brought the israelites out of egypt by their divisions the lord said to moses consecrate to me every firstborn male the first offspring of every womb among the israelites belongs to me whether man or animal then moses said to the people commemorate this day the day you came out of egypt out of the land of slavery because the lord brought you out of it with a mighty hand eat nothing containing yeast today in the month of abib you are leaving when the lord brings you into the land of the canaanites hittites amorites hivites and jebusites the land he swore to your forefathers to give you a land flowing with milk and honey you are to observe this ceremony in this month for seven days eat bread made without yeast and on the seventh day hold a festival to the lord eat unleavened bread during those seven days nothing with yeast in it is to be seen among you nor shall any yeast be seen anywhere within your borders on that day tell your son i do this because of what the lord did for me when i came out of egypt this observance will be for you like a sign on your hand and a reminder on your forehead that the law of the lord is to be on your lips for the lord brought you out of egypt with his mighty hand you must keep this ordinance at the appointed time year after year after the lord brings you into the land of the canaanites and gives it to you as he promised on oath to you and your forefathers you are to give over to the lord the first offspring of every womb all the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the lord redeem with a lamb every firstborn donkey but if you do not redeem it break its neck redeem every firstborn among your sons in days to come when your son asks you what does this mean say to him with a mighty hand the lord brought us out of egypt out of the land of slavery when pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go the lord killed every firstborn in egypt both man and animal this is why i sacrifice to the lord the first male offspring of every womb and redeem each of my firstborn sons and it will be like a sign on your hand and a symbol on your forehead that the lord brought us out of egypt with his mighty hand when pharaoh let the people go god did not lead them on the road through the philistine country though that was shorter for god said if they face war they might change their minds and return to egypt so god led the people around by the desert road toward the red sea the israelites went up out of egypt armed for battle moses took the bones of joseph with him because joseph had made the sons of israel swear an oath he had said god will surely come to your aid and then you must carry my bones up with you from this place after leaving succoth they camped at etham on the edge of the desert by day the lord went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light so that they could travel by day or night neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people then the lord said to moses tell the israelites to turn back and encamp near pi hahiroth between migdol and the sea they are to encamp by the sea directly opposite baal zephon pharaoh will think the israelites are wandering around the land in confusion hemmed in by the desert and i will harden pharaohs heart and he will pursue them but i will gain glory for myself through pharaoh and all his army and the egyptians will know that i am the lord so the israelites did this when the king of egypt was told that the people had fled pharaoh and his officials changed their minds about them and said what have we done we have let the israelites go and have lost their services so he had his chariot made ready and took his army with him he took six hundred of the best chariots along with all the other chariots of egypt with officers over all of them the lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of egypt so that he pursued the israelites who were marching out boldly the egyptians all pharaohs horses and chariots horsemen and troops pursued the israelites and overtook them as they camped by the sea near pi hahiroth opposite baal zephon as pharaoh approached the israelites looked up and there were the egyptians marching after them they were terrified and cried out to the lord they said to moses was it because there were no graves in egypt that you brought us to the desert to die what have you done to us by bringing us out of egypt didnt we say to you in egypt leave us alone let us serve the egyptians it would have been better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the desert moses answered the people do not be afraid stand firm and you will see the deliverance the lord will bring you today the egyptians you see today you will never see again the lord will fight for you you need only to be still then the lord said to moses why are you crying out to me tell the israelites to move on raise your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea to divide the water so that the israelites can go through the sea on dry ground i will harden the hearts of the egyptians so that they will go in after them and i will gain glory through pharaoh and all his army through his chariots and his horsemen the egyptians will know that i am the lord when i gain glory through pharaoh his chariots and his horsemen then the angel of god who had been traveling in front of israels army withdrew and went behind them the pillar of cloud also moved from in front and stood behind them coming between the armies of egypt and israel throughout the night the cloud brought darkness to the one side and light to the other side so neither went near the other all night long then moses stretched out his hand over the sea and all that night the lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land the waters were divided and the israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their right and on their left the egyptians pursued them and all pharaohs horses and chariots and horsemen followed them into the sea during the last watch of the night the lord looked down from the pillar of fire and cloud at the egyptian army and threw it into confusion he made the wheels of their chariots come off so that they had difficulty driving and the egyptians said lets get away from the israelites the lord is fighting for them against egypt then the lord said to moses stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may flow back over the egyptians and their chariots and horsemen moses stretched out his hand over the sea and at daybreak the sea went back to its place the egyptians were fleeing toward it and the lord swept them into the sea the water flowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen the entire army of pharaoh that had followed the israelites into the sea not one of them survived but the israelites went through the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on their right and on their left that day the lord saved israel from the hands of the egyptians and israel saw the egyptians lying dead on the shore and when the israelites saw the great power the lord displayed against the egyptians the people feared the lord and put their trust in him and in moses his servant then moses and the israelites sang this song to the lord i will sing to the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea the lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation he is my god and i will praise him my fathers god and i will exalt him the lord is a warrior the lord is his name pharaohs chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea the best of pharaohs officers are drowned in the red sea the deep waters have covered them they sank to the depths like a stone your right hand o lord was majestic in power your right hand o lord shattered the enemy in the greatness of your majesty you threw down those who opposed you you unleashed your burning anger it consumed them like stubble by the blast of your nostrils the waters piled up the surging waters stood firm like a wall the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea the enemy boasted i will pursue i will overtake them i will divide the spoils i will gorge myself on them i will draw my sword and my hand will destroy them but you blew with your breath and the sea covered them they sank like lead in the mighty waters who among the gods is like you o lord who is like you majestic in holiness awesome in glory working wonders you stretched out your right hand and the earth swallowed them in your unfailing love you will lead the people you have redeemed in your strength you will guide them to your holy dwelling the nations will hear and tremble anguish will grip the people of philistia the chiefs of edom will be terrified the leaders of moab will be seized with trembling the people of canaan will melt away terror and dread will fall upon them by the power of your arm they will be as still as a stone until your people pass by o lord until the people you bought pass by you will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance the place o lord you made for your dwelling the sanctuary o lord your hands established the lord will reign for ever and ever when pharaohs horses chariots and horsemen went into the sea the lord brought the waters of the sea back over them but the israelites walked through the sea on dry ground then miriam the prophetess aarons sister took a tambourine in her hand and all the women followed her with tambourines and dancing miriam sang to them sing to the lord for he is highly exalted the horse and its rider he has hurled into the sea then moses led israel from the red sea and they went into the desert of shur for three days they traveled in the desert without finding water when they came to marah they could not drink its water because it was bitter that is why the place is called marah  so the people grumbled against moses saying what are we to drink then moses cried out to the lord and the lord showed him a piece of wood he threw it into the water and the water became sweet there the lord made a decree and a law for them and there he tested them he said if you listen carefully to the voice of the lord your god and do what is right in his eyes if you pay attention to his commands and keep all his decrees i will not bring on you any of the diseases i brought on the egyptians for i am the lord who heals you then they came to elim where there were twelve springs and seventy palm trees and they camped there near the water the whole israelite community set out from elim and came to the desert of sin which is between elim and sinai on the fifteenth day of the second month after they had come out of egypt in the desert the whole community grumbled against moses and aaron the israelites said to them if only we had died by the lords hand in egypt there we sat around pots of meat and ate all the food we wanted but you have brought us out into this desert to starve this entire assembly to death then the lord said to moses i will rain down bread from heaven for you the people are to go out each day and gather enough for that day in this way i will test them and see whether they will follow my instructions on the sixth day they are to prepare what they bring in and that is to be twice as much as they gather on the other days so moses and aaron said to all the israelites in the evening you will know that it was the lord who brought you out of egypt and in the morning you will see the glory of the lord because he has heard your grumbling against him who are we that you should grumble against us moses also said you will know that it was the lord when he gives you meat to eat in the evening and all the bread you want in the morning because he has heard your grumbling against him who are we you are not grumbling against us but against the lord then moses told aaron say to the entire israelite community come before the lord for he has heard your grumbling while aaron was speaking to the whole israelite community they looked toward the desert and there was the glory of the lord appearing in the cloud the lord said to moses i have heard the grumbling of the israelites tell them at twilight you will eat meat and in the morning you will be filled with bread then you will know that i am the lord your god that evening quail came and covered the camp and in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp when the dew was gone thin flakes like frost on the ground appeared on the desert floor when the israelites saw it they said to each other what is it for they did not know what it was moses said to them it is the bread the lord has given you to eat this is what the lord has commanded each one is to gather as much as he needs take an omer for each person you have in your tent the israelites did as they were told some gathered much some little and when they measured it by the omer he who gathered much did not have too much and he who gathered little did not have too little each one gathered as much as he needed then moses said to them no one is to keep any of it until morning however some of them paid no attention to moses they kept part of it until morning but it was full of maggots and began to smell so moses was angry with them each morning everyone gathered as much as he needed and when the sun grew hot it melted away on the sixth day they gathered twice as much two omers for each person and the leaders of the community came and reported this to moses he said to them this is what the lord commanded tomorrow is to be a day of rest a holy sabbath to the lord so bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil save whatever is left and keep it until morning so they saved it until morning as moses commanded and it did not stink or get maggots in it eat it today moses said because today is a sabbath to the lord you will not find any of it on the ground today six days you are to gather it but on the seventh day the sabbath there will not be any nevertheless some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather it but they found none then the lord said to moses how long will you refuse to keep my commands and my instructions bear in mind that the lord has given you the sabbath that is why on the sixth day he gives you bread for two days everyone is to stay where he is on the seventh day no one is to go out so the people rested on the seventh day the people of israel called the bread manna it was white like coriander seed and tasted like wafers made with honey moses said this is what the lord has commanded take an omer of manna and keep it for the generations to come so they can see the bread i gave you to eat in the desert when i brought you out of egypt so moses said to aaron take a jar and put an omer of manna in it then place it before the lord to be kept for the generations to come as the lord commanded moses aaron put the manna in front of the testimony that it might be kept the israelites ate manna forty years until they came to a land that was settled they ate manna until they reached the border of canaan an omer is one tenth of an ephah the whole israelite community set out from the desert of sin traveling from place to place as the lord commanded they camped at rephidim but there was no water for the people to drink so they quarreled with moses and said give us water to drink moses replied why do you quarrel with me why do you put the lord to the test but the people were thirsty for water there and they grumbled against moses they said why did you bring us up out of egypt to make us and our children and livestock die of thirst then moses cried out to the lord what am i to do with these people they are almost ready to stone me the lord answered moses walk on ahead of the people take with you some of the elders of israel and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the nile and go i will stand there before you by the rock at horeb strike the rock and water will come out of it for the people to drink so moses did this in the sight of the elders of israel and he called the place massah and meribah because the israelites quarreled and because they tested the lord saying is the lord among us or not the amalekites came and attacked the israelites at rephidim moses said to joshua choose some of our men and go out to fight the amalekites tomorrow i will stand on top of the hill with the staff of god in my hands so joshua fought the amalekites as moses had ordered and moses aaron and hur went to the top of the hill as long as moses held up his hands the israelites were winning but whenever he lowered his hands the amalekites were winning when moses hands grew tired they took a stone and put it under him and he sat on it aaron and hur held his hands up one on one side one on the other so that his hands remained steady till sunset so joshua overcame the amalekite army with the sword then the lord said to moses write this on a scroll as something to be remembered and make sure that joshua hears it because i will completely blot out the memory of amalek from under heaven moses built an altar and called it the lord is my banner he said for hands were lifted up to the throne of the lord the lord will be at war against the amalekites from generation to generation now jethro the priest of midian and father in law of moses heard of everything god had done for moses and for his people israel and how the lord had brought israel out of egypt after moses had sent away his wife zipporah his father in law jethro received her and her two sons one son was named gershom for moses said i have become an alien in a foreign land and the other was named eliezer for he said my fathers god was my helper he saved me from the sword of pharaoh jethro moses father in law together with moses sons and wife came to him in the desert where he was camped near the mountain of god jethro had sent word to him i your father in law jethro am coming to you with your wife and her two sons so moses went out to meet his father in law and bowed down and kissed him they greeted each other and then went into the tent moses told his father in law about everything the lord had done to pharaoh and the egyptians for israels sake and about all the hardships they had met along the way and how the lord had saved them jethro was delighted to hear about all the good things the lord had done for israel in rescuing them from the hand of the egyptians he said praise be to the lord who rescued you from the hand of the egyptians and of pharaoh and who rescued the people from the hand of the egyptians now i know that the lord is greater than all other gods for he did this to those who had treated israel arrogantly then jethro moses father in law brought a burnt offering and other sacrifices to god and aaron came with all the elders of israel to eat bread with moses father in law in the presence of god the next day moses took his seat to serve as judge for the people and they stood around him from morning till evening when his father in law saw all that moses was doing for the people he said what is this you are doing for the people why do you alone sit as judge while all these people stand around you from morning till evening moses answered him because the people come to me to seek gods will whenever they have a dispute it is brought to me and i decide between the parties and inform them of gods decrees and laws moses father in law replied what you are doing is not good you and these people who come to you will only wear yourselves out the work is too heavy for you you cannot handle it alone listen now to me and i will give you some advice and may god be with you you must be the peoples representative before god and bring their disputes to him teach them the decrees and laws and show them the way to live and the duties they are to perform but select capable men from all the people men who fear god trustworthy men who hate dishonest gain and appoint them as officials over thousands hundreds fifties and tens have them serve as judges for the people at all times but have them bring every difficult case to you the simple cases they can decide themselves that will make your load lighter because they will share it with you if you do this and god so commands you will be able to stand the strain and all these people will go home satisfied moses listened to his father in law and did everything he said he chose capable men from all israel and made them leaders of the people officials over thousands hundreds fifties and tens they served as judges for the people at all times the difficult cases they brought to moses but the simple ones they decided themselves then moses sent his father in law on his way and jethro returned to his own country in the third month after the israelites left egypt on the very day they came to the desert of sinai after they set out from rephidim they entered the desert of sinai and israel camped there in the desert in front of the mountain then moses went up to god and the lord called to him from the mountain and said this is what you are to say to the house of jacob and what you are to tell the people of israel you yourselves have seen what i did to egypt and how i carried you on eagles wings and brought you to myself now if you obey me fully and keep my covenant then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession although the whole earth is mine you will be for me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation these are the words you are to speak to the israelites so moses went back and summoned the elders of the people and set before them all the words the lord had commanded him to speak the people all responded together we will do everything the lord has said so moses brought their answer back to the lord the lord said to moses i am going to come to you in a dense cloud so that the people will hear me speaking with you and will always put their trust in you then moses told the lord what the people had said and the lord said to moses go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow have them wash their clothes and be ready by the third day because on that day the lord will come down on mount sinai in the sight of all the people put limits for the people around the mountain and tell them be careful that you do not go up the mountain or touch the foot of it whoever touches the mountain shall surely be put to death he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows not a hand is to be laid on him whether man or animal he shall not be permitted to live only when the rams horn sounds a long blast may they go up to the mountain after moses had gone down the mountain to the people he consecrated them and they washed their clothes then he said to the people prepare yourselves for the third day abstain from sexual relations on the morning of the third day there was thunder and lightning with a thick cloud over the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast everyone in the camp trembled then moses led the people out of the camp to meet with god and they stood at the foot of the mountain mount sinai was covered with smoke because the lord descended on it in fire the smoke billowed up from it like smoke from a furnace the whole mountain trembled violently and the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder then moses spoke and the voice of god answered him the lord descended to the top of mount sinai and called moses to the top of the mountain so moses went up and the lord said to him go down and warn the people so they do not force their way through to see the lord and many of them perish even the priests who approach the lord must consecrate themselves or the lord will break out against them moses said to the lord the people cannot come up mount sinai because you yourself warned us put limits around the mountain and set it apart as holy the lord replied go down and bring aaron up with you but the priests and the people must not force their way through to come up to the lord or he will break out against them so moses went down to the people and told them and god spoke all these words i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt out of the land of slavery you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me but showing love to a thousand {generations} of those who love me and keep my commandments you shall not misuse the name of the lord your god for the lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name remember the sabbath day by keeping it holy six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it you shall not do any work neither you nor your son or daughter nor your manservant or maidservant nor your animals nor the alien within your gates for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth the sea and all that is in them but he rested on the seventh day therefore the lord blessed the sabbath day and made it holy honor your father and your mother so that you may live long in the land the lord your god is giving you you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not give false testimony against your neighbor you shall not covet your neighbors house you shall not covet your neighbors wife or his manservant or maidservant his ox or donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor when the people saw the thunder and lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain in smoke they trembled with fear they stayed at a distance and said to moses speak to us yourself and we will listen but do not have god speak to us or we will die moses said to the people do not be afraid god has come to test you so that the fear of god will be with you to keep you from sinning the people remained at a distance while moses approached the thick darkness where god was then the lord said to moses tell the israelites this you have seen for yourselves that i have spoken to you from heaven do not make any gods to be alongside me do not make for yourselves gods of silver or gods of gold make an altar of earth for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings your sheep and goats and your cattle wherever i cause my name to be honored i will come to you and bless you if you make an altar of stones for me do not build it with dressed stones for you will defile it if you use a tool on it and do not go up to my altar on steps lest your nakedness be exposed on it these are the laws you are to set before them if you buy a hebrew servant he is to serve you for six years but in the seventh year he shall go free without paying anything if he comes alone he is to go free alone but if he has a wife when he comes she is to go with him if his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters the woman and her children shall belong to her master and only the man shall go free but if the servant declares i love my master and my wife and children and do not want to go free then his master must take him before the judges he shall take him to the door or the doorpost and pierce his ear with an awl then he will be his servant for life if a man sells his daughter as a servant she is not to go free as menservants do if she does not please the master who has selected her for himself he must let her be redeemed he has no right to sell her to foreigners because he has broken faith with her if he selects her for his son he must grant her the rights of a daughter if he marries another woman he must not deprive the first one of her food clothing and marital rights if he does not provide her with these three things she is to go free without any payment of money anyone who strikes a man and kills him shall surely be put to death however if he does not do it intentionally but god lets it happen he is to flee to a place i will designate but if a man schemes and kills another man deliberately take him away from my altar and put him to death anyone who attacks his father or his mother must be put to death anyone who kidnaps another and either sells him or still has him when he is caught must be put to death anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death if men quarrel and one hits the other with a stone or with his fist and he does not die but is confined to bed the one who struck the blow will not be held responsible if the other gets up and walks around outside with his staff however he must pay the injured man for the loss of his time and see that he is completely healed if a man beats his male or female slave with a rod and the slave dies as a direct result he must be punished but he is not to be punished if the slave gets up after a day or two since the slave is his property if men who are fighting hit a pregnant woman and she gives birth prematurely but there is no serious injury the offender must be fined whatever the womans husband demands and the court allows but if there is serious injury you are to take life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burn for burn wound for wound bruise for bruise if a man hits a manservant or maidservant in the eye and destroys it he must let the servant go free to compensate for the eye and if he knocks out the tooth of a manservant or maidservant he must let the servant go free to compensate for the tooth if a bull gores a man or a woman to death the bull must be stoned to death and its meat must not be eaten but the owner of the bull will not be held responsible if however the bull has had the habit of goring and the owner has been warned but has not kept it penned up and it kills a man or woman the bull must be stoned and the owner also must be put to death however if payment is demanded of him he may redeem his life by paying whatever is demanded this law also applies if the bull gores a son or daughter if the bull gores a male or female slave the owner must pay thirty shekels of silver to the master of the slave and the bull must be stoned if a man uncovers a pit or digs one and fails to cover it and an ox or a donkey falls into it the owner of the pit must pay for the loss he must pay its owner and the dead animal will be his if a mans bull injures the bull of another and it dies they are to sell the live one and divide both the money and the dead animal equally however if it was known that the bull had the habit of goring yet the owner did not keep it penned up the owner must pay animal for animal and the dead animal will be his if a man steals an ox or a sheep and slaughters it or sells it he must pay back five head of cattle for the ox and four sheep for the sheep if a thief is caught breaking in and is struck so that he dies the defender is not guilty of bloodshed but if it happens after sunrise he is guilty of bloodshed a thief must certainly make restitution but if he has nothing he must be sold to pay for his theft if the stolen animal is found alive in his possession whether ox or donkey or sheep he must pay back double if a man grazes his livestock in a field or vineyard and lets them stray and they graze in another mans field he must make restitution from the best of his own field or vineyard if a fire breaks out and spreads into thornbushes so that it burns shocks of grain or standing grain or the whole field the one who started the fire must make restitution if a man gives his neighbor silver or goods for safekeeping and they are stolen from the neighbors house the thief if he is caught must pay back double but if the thief is not found the owner of the house must appear before the judges to determine whether he has laid his hands on the other mans property in all cases of illegal possession of an ox a donkey a sheep a garment or any other lost property about which somebody says this is mine both parties are to bring their cases before the judges the one whom the judges declare guilty must pay back double to his neighbor if a man gives a donkey an ox a sheep or any other animal to his neighbor for safekeeping and it dies or is injured or is taken away while no one is looking the issue between them will be settled by the taking of an oath before the lord that the neighbor did not lay hands on the other persons property the owner is to accept this and no restitution is required but if the animal was stolen from the neighbor he must make restitution to the owner if it was torn to pieces by a wild animal he shall bring in the remains as evidence and he will not be required to pay for the torn animal if a man borrows an animal from his neighbor and it is injured or dies while the owner is not present he must make restitution but if the owner is with the animal the borrower will not have to pay if the animal was hired the money paid for the hire covers the loss if a man seduces a virgin who is not pledged to be married and sleeps with her he must pay the bride price and she shall be his wife if her father absolutely refuses to give her to him he must still pay the bride price for virgins do not allow a sorceress to live anyone who has sexual relations with an animal must be put to death whoever sacrifices to any god other than the lord must be destroyed do not mistreat an alien or oppress him for you were aliens in egypt do not take advantage of a widow or an orphan if you do and they cry out to me i will certainly hear their cry my anger will be

make artistic designs for work in gold silver and bronze to cut and set stones to work in wood and to engage in all kinds of craftsmanship moreover i have appointed oholiab son of ahisamach of the

know that i am the lord who makes you holy observe the sabbath because it is holy to you anyone who desecrates it must be put to death whoever does any work on that day must be cut off from his people

celebrating it for the generations to come as a lasting covenant it will be a sign between me and the israelites forever for in six days the lord made the heavens and the earth and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested when the lord finished speaking to moses on mount sinai he gave him the two tablets of the testimony the tablets of stone inscribed by the finger of god when the people saw that moses was so long in coming down from the mountain they gathered around aaron and said come make us gods who will go before us as for this fellow moses who brought us up out of egypt we dont know what has happened to him aaron answered them take off the gold earrings that your wives your sons and your daughters are wearing and bring them to me so all the people took off their earrings and brought them to aaron he took what they handed him and made it into an idol cast in the shape of a calf fashioning it with a tool then they said these are your gods o israel who brought you up out of egypt when aaron saw this he built an altar in front of the calf and announced tomorrow there will be a festival to the lord so the next day the people rose early and sacrificed burnt offerings and presented fellowship offerings afterward they sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in revelry then the lord said to moses go down because your people whom you brought up out of egypt have become corrupt they have been quick to turn away from what i commanded them and have made themselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf they have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and have said these are your gods o israel who brought you up out of egypt i have seen these people the lord said to moses and they are a stiff necked people now leave me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that i may destroy them then i will make you into a great nation but moses sought the favor of the lord his god o lord he said why should your anger burn against your people whom you brought out of egypt with great power and a mighty hand why should the egyptians say it was with evil intent that he brought them out to kill them in the mountains and to wipe them off the face of the earth turn from your fierce anger relent and do not bring disaster on your people remember your servants abraham isaac and israel to whom you swore by your own self i will make your descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and i will give your descendants all this land i promised them and it will be their inheritance forever then the lord relented and did not bring on his people the disaster he had threatened moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands they were inscribed on both sides front and back the tablets were the work of god the writing was the writing of god engraved on the tablets when joshua heard the noise of the people shouting he said to moses there is the sound of war in the camp moses replied it is not the sound of victory it is not the sound of defeat it is the sound of singing that i hear when moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing his anger burned and he threw the tablets out of his hands breaking them to pieces at the foot of the mountain and he took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire then he ground it to powder scattered it on the water and made the israelites drink it he said to aaron what did these people do to you that you led them into such great sin do not be angry my lord aaron answered you know how prone these people are to evil they said to me make us gods who will go before us as for this fellow moses who brought us up out of egypt we dont know what has happened to him so i told them whoever has any gold jewelry take it off then they gave me the gold and i threw it into the fire and out came this calf moses saw that the people were running wild and that aaron had let them get out of control and so become a laughingstock to their enemies so he stood at the entrance to the camp and said whoever is for the lord come to me and all the levites rallied to him then he said to them this is what the lord the god of israel says each man strap a sword to his side go back and forth through the camp from one end to the other each killing his brother and friend and neighbor the levites did as moses commanded and that day about three thousand of the people died then moses said you have been set apart to the lord today for you were against your own sons and brothers and he has blessed you this day the next day moses said to the people you have committed a great sin but now i will go up to the lord perhaps i can make atonement for your sin so moses went back to the lord and said oh what a great sin these people have committed they have made themselves gods of gold but now please forgive their sin but if not then blot me out of the book you have written the lord replied to moses whoever has sinned against me i will blot out of my book now go lead the people to the place i spoke of and my angel will go before you however when the time comes for me to punish i will punish them for their sin and the lord struck the people with a plague because of what they did with the calf aaron had made then the lord said to moses leave this place you and the people you brought up out of egypt and go up to the land i promised on oath to abraham isaac and jacob saying i will give it to your descendants i will send an angel before you and drive out the canaanites amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites go up to the land flowing with milk and honey but i will not go with you because you are a stiff necked people and i might destroy you on the way when the people heard these distressing words they began to mourn and no one put on any ornaments for the lord had said to moses tell the israelites you are a stiff necked people if i were to go with you even for a moment i might destroy you now take off your ornaments and i will decide what to do with you so the israelites stripped off their ornaments at mount horeb now moses used to take a tent and pitch it outside the camp some distance away calling it the tent of meeting anyone inquiring of the lord would go to the tent of meeting outside the camp and whenever moses went out to the tent all the people rose and stood at the entrances to their tents watching moses until he entered the tent as moses went into the tent the pillar of cloud would come down and stay at the entrance while the lord spoke with moses whenever the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance to the tent they all stood and worshiped each at the entrance to his tent the lord would speak to moses face to face as a man speaks with his friend then moses would return to the camp but his young aide joshua son of nun did not leave the tent moses said to the lord you have been telling me lead these people but you have not let me know whom you will send with me you have said i know you by name and you have found favor with me if you are pleased with me teach me your ways so i may know you and continue to find favor with you remember that this nation is your people the lord replied my presence will go with you and i will give you rest then moses said to him if your presence does not go with us do not send us up from here how will anyone know that you are pleased with me and with your people unless you go with us what else will distinguish me and your people from all the other people on the face of the earth and the lord said to moses i will do the very thing you have asked because i am pleased with you and i know you by name then moses said now show me your glory and the lord said i will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and i will proclaim my name the lord in your presence i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion but he said you cannot see my face for no one may see me and live then the lord said there is a place near me where you may stand on a rock when my glory passes by i will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until i have passed by then i will remove my hand and you will see my back but my face must not be seen the lord said to moses chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and i will write on them the words that were on the first tablets which you broke be ready in the morning and then come up on mount sinai present yourself to me there on top of the mountain no one is to come with you or be seen anywhere on the mountain not even the flocks and herds may graze in front of the mountain so moses chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and went up mount sinai early in the morning as the lord had commanded him and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands then the lord came down in the cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed his name the lord and he passed in front of moses proclaiming the lord the lord the compassionate and gracious god slow to anger abounding in love and faithfulness maintaining love to thousands and forgiving wickedness rebellion and sin yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished he punishes the children and their children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation moses bowed to the ground at once and worshiped o lord if i have found favor in your eyes he said then let the lord go with us although this is a stiff necked people forgive our wickedness and our sin and take us as your inheritance then the lord said i am making a covenant with you before all your people i will do wonders never before done in any nation in all the world the people you live among will see how awesome is the work that i the lord will do for you obey what i command you today i will drive out before you the amorites canaanites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land where you are going or they will be a snare among you break down their altars smash their sacred stones and cut down their asherah poles do not worship any other god for the lord whose name is jealous is a jealous god be careful not to make a treaty with those who live in the land for when they prostitute themselves to their gods and sacrifice to them they will invite you and you will eat their sacrifices and when you choose some of their daughters as wives for your sons and those daughters prostitute themselves to their gods they will lead your sons to do the same do not make cast idols celebrate the feast of unleavened bread for seven days eat bread made without yeast as i commanded you do this at the appointed time in the month of abib for in that month you came out of egypt the first offspring of every womb belongs to me including all the firstborn males of your livestock whether from herd or flock redeem the firstborn donkey with a lamb but if you do not redeem it break its neck redeem all your firstborn sons no one is to appear before me empty handed six days you shall labor but on the seventh day you shall rest even during the plowing season and harvest you must rest celebrate the feast of weeks with the firstfruits of the wheat harvest and the feast of ingathering at the turn of the year three times a year all your men are to appear before the sovereign lord the god of israel i will drive out nations before you and enlarge your territory and no one will covet your land when you go up three times each year to appear before the lord your god do not offer the blood of a sacrifice to me along with anything containing yeast and do not let any of the sacrifice from the passover feast remain until morning bring the best of the firstfruits of your soil to the house of the lord your god do not cook a young goat in its mothers milk then the lord said to moses write down these words for in accordance with these words i have made a covenant with you and with israel moses was there with the lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water and he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant the ten commandments when moses came down from mount sinai with the two tablets of the testimony in his hands he was not aware that his face was radiant because he had spoken with the lord when aaron and all the israelites saw moses his face was radiant and they were afraid to come near him but moses called to them so aaron and all the leaders of the community came back to him and he spoke to them afterward all the israelites came near him and he gave them all the commands the lord had given him on mount sinai when moses finished speaking to them he put a veil over his face but whenever he entered the lords presence to speak with him he removed the veil until he came out and when he came out and told the israelites what he had been commanded they saw that his face was radiant then moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with the lord moses assembled the whole israelite community and said to them these are the things the lord has commanded you to do for six days work is to be done but the seventh day shall be your holy day a sabbath of rest to the lord whoever does any work on it must be put to death do not light a fire in any of your dwellings on the sabbath day moses said to the whole israelite community this

sons and asked why didnt you eat the sin offering in the sanctuary area it is most holy it was given to you to take away the guilt of the community by making atonement for them before the lord since its blood was not taken into the holy place you should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary area as i commanded aaron replied to moses today they sacrificed their sin offering and their burnt offering

household and he is to slaughter the bull for his own sin offering he is to take a censer full of burning coals from the altar before the lord and two handfuls of finely ground fragrant incense and take them behind the curtain he is to put the incense on the fire before the lord and the smoke of the incense will conceal the atonement cover above the testimony so that he will not die he is to take some of the bulls blood and with his finger sprinkle it on the front of the atonement cover then he shall sprinkle some of it with his finger seven times before the atonement cover he shall then slaughter the goat for the sin offering for the people and take its blood behind the curtain and do with it as he did with the bulls blood he shall sprinkle it on the atonement cover and in front of it in this way he will make atonement for the most holy place because of the uncleanness and rebellion of the israelites whatever their sins have been he is to do the same for the tent of meeting which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness no one is to be in the tent of meeting from the time aaron goes in to make atonement in the most holy place until he comes out having made

some of the goats blood and put it on all the horns of the altar he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger seven times to cleanse it and to consecrate it from the uncleanness of the

this is to be a lasting ordinance for you on the tenth day of the seventh month you must deny yourselves and not do any work whether native born or an alien living among you because on this day atonement will be made for you to cleanse you then before the lord you will be clean from all your sins it is a sabbath of rest and you must deny yourselves it is a lasting ordinance the priest who is anointed and ordained to succeed his father as high priest is to make atonement he is to put on the sacred linen garments and make atonement for the most holy place for the tent of meeting and the altar and for the priests and all the people of the community this is to be a lasting ordinance for you atonement is to be made once a year for all the sins of the israelites and it was done as the lord commanded moses the lord said to moses speak to aaron and his sons and to all the israelites and say to them this is what the lord has commanded any israelite who sacrifices an ox a lamb or a goat in the camp or outside of it instead of bringing it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to present it as an offering to the lord in front of the tabernacle of the lord that man shall be considered guilty of bloodshed he has shed blood and must be cut off from his people this is so the israelites will bring to the lord the sacrifices they are now making in the open fields they must bring them to the priest that is to the lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting and sacrifice them as fellowship offerings the priest is to sprinkle the blood against the altar of the lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting and burn the fat as an aroma pleasing to the lord they must no longer offer any of their sacrifices to the goat idols to whom they prostitute themselves this is to be a lasting ordinance for them and for the generations to come say to them any israelite or any alien living among them who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice and does not bring it to the entrance to the tent of meeting to sacrifice it to the lord that man must be cut off from his people any israelite or any alien living among them who eats any blood i will set my face against that person who eats blood and will cut him off from his people for the life of a creature is in the blood and i have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar it is the blood that makes atonement for ones life therefore i say to the israelites none of you may eat blood nor may an alien living among you eat blood any israelite or any alien living among you who hunts any animal or bird that may be eaten must drain out the blood and cover it with earth because the life of every creature is its blood that is why i have said to the israelites you must not eat the blood of any creature because the life of every creature is its blood anyone who eats it must be cut off anyone whether native born or alien who eats anything found dead or torn by wild animals must wash his clothes and bathe with water and he will be ceremonially unclean till evening then he will be clean but if he does not wash his clothes and bathe himself he will be held responsible the lord said to moses speak to the

and so defile himself priests must not shave their heads or shave off the edges of their beards or cut their bodies they must be holy to their god and must not profane the name of their god because they present the offerings made to the lord by fire the food of their god they are to be holy they must not marry women defiled by prostitution or divorced from their husbands because priests are holy

food yet because of his defect he must not go near the curtain or approach the altar and so desecrate my sanctuary i am the lord who makes them holy so moses told this to aaron and his sons and to all the israelites the lord said to moses tell aaron and his sons to treat with respect the sacred offerings the israelites consecrate to me so they will not profane my holy name i am the lord say to them for the generations to come if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean and yet comes near the sacred offerings that the israelites consecrate to the lord that person must be cut off from my presence i am the lord if a descendant of aaron has an infectious skin disease or a bodily discharge he may not eat the sacred offerings until he is cleansed he will also be unclean if he touches something defiled by a corpse or by anyone who has an emission of semen or if he touches any crawling thing that makes him unclean or any person who makes him unclean whatever the uncleanness may be the one who touches any such thing will be unclean till evening he must not eat any of the sacred offerings unless he has bathed himself with water when the sun goes down he will be clean and after that he may eat the sacred offerings for they are his food he must not eat anything found dead or torn by wild animals and so become unclean through it i am the lord the priests are to keep my requirements so that they do not become guilty and die for treating them with contempt i am the lord who makes them holy no one outside a priests family may eat the sacred offering nor may the guest of a priest or his hired worker eat it but if a priest buys a slave with money or if a slave is born in his household that slave may eat his food if a priests daughter marries anyone other than a priest she may not eat any of the sacred contributions but if a priests daughter becomes a widow or is divorced yet has no children and she returns to live in her fathers house as in her youth she may eat of her fathers food no unauthorized person however may eat any of it if anyone eats a sacred offering by mistake he must make restitution to the priest for the offering and add a fifth of the value to it the priests must not desecrate the sacred offerings the israelites present to the lord by allowing them to eat the sacred offerings and so bring upon them guilt requiring payment i am the lord who makes them holy the lord said to moses speak to aaron and his sons and to all the israelites and say to them if any of you either an israelite or an alien living in israel presents a gift for

the bread and to be an offering made to the lord by fire this bread is to be set out before the lord regularly sabbath after sabbath on behalf of the israelites as a lasting covenant it belongs to aaron and his sons who are to eat it in a holy place because it is a most holy part of their regular share of the offerings made to the lord by fire a blasphemer stoned now the son of an israelite mother and an egyptian father went out among the israelites and a fight broke out in the camp between him and an israelite the son of the israelite woman blasphemed the name with a curse so they brought him to moses his mothers name was shelomith the daughter of dibri the danite they put him in custody until the will of the lord should be made clear to them then the lord said to moses take the blasphemer outside the camp all those who heard him are to lay their hands on his head and the entire assembly is to stone him say to the israelites if anyone curses his god he will be held responsible anyone who blasphemes the name of the lord must be put to death the entire assembly must stone him whether an alien or native born when he blasphemes the name he must be put to death if anyone takes the life of a human being he must be put to death anyone who takes the life of someones animal must make restitution life for life if anyone injures his neighbor whatever he has done must be done to him fracture for fracture eye for eye tooth for tooth as he has injured the other so he is to be injured whoever kills an animal must make restitution but whoever kills a man must be put to death you are to have the same law for the alien and the native born i am the lord your god then moses spoke to the israelites and they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him the israelites did as the lord commanded moses the lord said to moses on mount sinai speak to the israelites and say to them when you enter the land i am going to give you the land itself must observe a sabbath to the lord for six years sow your fields and for six years prune your vineyards and gather their crops but in the seventh year the land is to have a sabbath of rest a sabbath to the lord do not sow your fields or prune your vineyards do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the grapes of your untended vines the land is to have a year of rest whatever the land yields during the sabbath year will be food for you for yourself your manservant and maidservant and the hired worker and temporary resident who live among you as well as for your livestock and the wild animals in your land whatever the land produces may be eaten count off seven sabbaths of years seven times seven years so that the seven sabbaths of years amount to a period of forty nine years then have the trumpet sounded everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month on the day of atonement sound the trumpet throughout your land consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants it shall be a jubilee for you each one of you is to return to his family property and each to his own clan the fiftieth year shall be a jubilee for you do not sow and do not reap what grows of itself or harvest the untended vines for it is a jubilee and is to be holy for you eat only what is taken directly from the fields in this year of jubilee everyone is to return to his own property if you sell land to one of your countrymen or buy any from him do not take advantage of each other you are to buy from your countryman on the basis of the number of years since the jubilee and he is to sell to you on the basis of the number of years left for harvesting crops when the years are many you are to increase the price and when the years are few you are to decrease the price because what he is really selling you is the number of crops do not take advantage of each other but fear your god i am the lord your god follow my decrees and be careful to obey my laws and you will live safely in the land then the land will yield its fruit and you will eat your fill and live there in safety you may ask what will we eat in the seventh year if we do not plant or harvest our crops i will send you such a blessing in the sixth year that the land will yield enough for three years while you plant during the eighth year you will eat from the old crop and will continue to eat from it until the harvest of the ninth year comes in the land must not be sold permanently because the land is mine and you are but aliens and my tenants throughout the country that you hold as a possession you must provide for the redemption of the land if one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells some of his property his nearest relative is to come and redeem what his countryman has sold if however a man has no one to redeem it for him but he himself prospers and acquires sufficient means to redeem it he is to determine the value for the years since he sold it and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it he can then go back to his own property but if he does not acquire the means to repay him what he sold will remain in the possession of the buyer until the year of jubilee it will be returned in the jubilee and he can then go back to his property if a man sells a house in a walled city he retains the right of redemption a full year after its sale during that time he may redeem it if it is not redeemed before a full year has passed the house in the walled city shall belong permanently to the buyer and his descendants it is not to be returned in the jubilee but houses in villages without walls around them are to be considered as open country they can be redeemed and they are to be returned in the jubilee the levites always have the right to redeem their houses in the levitical towns which they possess so the property of the levites is redeemable that is a house sold in any town they hold and is to be returned in the jubilee because the houses in the towns of the levites are their property among the israelites but the pastureland belonging to their towns must not be sold it is their permanent possession if one of your countrymen becomes poor and is unable to support himself among you help him as you would an alien or a temporary resident so he can continue to live among you do not take interest of any kind from him but fear your god so that your countryman may continue to live among you you must not lend him money at interest or sell him food at a profit i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt to give you the land of canaan and to be your god if one of your countrymen becomes poor among you and sells himself to you do not make him work as a slave he is to be treated as a hired worker or a temporary resident among you he is to work for you until the year of jubilee then he and his children are to be released and he will go back to his own clan and to the property of his forefathers because the israelites are my servants whom i brought out of egypt they must not be sold as slaves do not rule over them ruthlessly but fear your god your male and female slaves are to come from the nations around you from them you may buy slaves you may also buy some of the temporary residents living among you and members of their clans born in your country and they will become your property you can will them to your children as inherited property and can make them slaves for life but you must not rule over your fellow israelites ruthlessly if an alien or a temporary resident among you becomes rich and one of your countrymen becomes poor and sells himself to the alien living among you or to a member of the aliens clan he retains the right of redemption after he has sold himself one of his relatives may redeem him an uncle or a cousin or any blood relative in his clan may redeem him or if he prospers he may redeem himself he and his buyer are to count the time from the year he sold himself up to the year of jubilee the price for his release is to be based on the rate paid to a hired man for that number of years if many years remain he must pay for his redemption a larger share of the price paid for him if only a few years remain until the year of jubilee he is to compute that and pay for his redemption accordingly he is to be treated as a man hired from year to year you must see to it that his owner does not rule over him ruthlessly even if he is not redeemed in any of these ways he and his children are to be released in the year of jubilee for the israelites belong to me as servants they are my servants whom i brought out of egypt i am the lord your god do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves and do not place a carved stone in your land to bow down before it i am the lord your god observe my sabbaths and have reverence for my sanctuary i am the lord if you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands i will send you rain in its season and the ground will yield its crops and the trees of the field their fruit your threshing will continue until grape harvest and the grape harvest will continue until planting and you will eat all the food you want and live in safety in your land i will grant peace in the land and you will lie down and no one will make you afraid i will remove savage beasts from the land and the sword will not pass through your country you will pursue your enemies and they will fall by the sword before you five of you will chase a hundred and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand and your enemies will fall by the sword before you i will look on you with favor and make you fruitful and increase your numbers and i will keep my covenant with you you will still be eating last years harvest when you will have to move it out to make room for the new i will put my dwelling place among you and i will not abhor you i will walk among you and be your god and you will be my people i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt so that you would no longer be slaves to the egyptians i broke the bars of your yoke and enabled you to walk with heads held high but if you will not listen to me and carry out all these commands and if you reject my decrees and abhor my laws and fail to carry out all my commands and so violate my covenant then i will do this to you i will bring upon you sudden terror wasting diseases and fever that will destroy your sight and drain away your life you will plant seed in vain because your enemies will eat it i will set my face against you so that you will be defeated by your enemies those who hate you will rule over you and you will flee even when no one is pursuing you if after all this you will not listen to me i will punish you for your sins seven times over i will break down your stubborn pride and make the sky above you like iron and the ground beneath you like bronze your strength will be spent in vain because your soil will not yield its crops nor will the trees of the land yield their fruit if you remain hostile toward me and refuse to listen to me i will multiply your afflictions seven times over as your sins deserve i will send wild animals against you and they will rob you of your children destroy your cattle and make you so few in number that your roads will be deserted if in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me i myself will be hostile toward you and will afflict you for your sins seven times over and i will bring the sword upon you to avenge the breaking of the covenant when you withdraw into your cities i will send a plague among you and you will be given into enemy hands when i cut off your supply of bread ten women will be able to bake your bread in one oven and they will dole out the bread by weight you will eat but you will not be satisfied if in spite of this you still do not listen to me but continue to be hostile toward me then in my anger i will be hostile toward you and i myself will punish you for your sins seven times over you will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters i will destroy your high places cut down your incense altars and pile your dead bodies on the lifeless forms of your idols and i will abhor you i will turn your cities into ruins and lay waste your sanctuaries and i will take no delight in the pleasing aroma of your offerings i will lay waste the land so that your enemies who live there will be appalled i will scatter you among the nations and will draw out my sword and pursue you your land will be laid waste and your cities will lie in ruins then the land will enjoy its sabbath years all the time that it lies desolate and you are in the country of your enemies then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths all the time that it lies desolate the land will have the rest it did not have during the sabbaths you lived in it as for those of you who are left i will make their hearts so fearful in the lands of their enemies that the sound of a windblown leaf will put them to flight they will run as though fleeing from the sword and they will fall even though no one is pursuing them they will stumble over one another as though fleeing from the sword even though no one is pursuing them so you will not be able to stand before your enemies you will perish among the nations the land of your enemies will devour you those of you who are left will waste away in the lands of their enemies because of their sins also because of their fathers sins they will waste away but if they will confess their sins and the sins of their fathers their treachery against me and their hostility toward me which made me hostile toward them so that i sent them into the land of their enemies then when their uncircumcised hearts are humbled and they pay for their sin i will remember my covenant with jacob and my covenant with isaac and my covenant with abraham and i will remember the land for the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them they will pay for their sins because they rejected my laws and abhorred my decrees yet in spite of this when they are in the land of their enemies i will not reject them or abhor them so as to destroy them completely breaking my covenant with them i am the lord their god but for their sake i will remember the covenant with their ancestors whom i brought out of egypt in the sight of the nations to be their god i am the lord these are the decrees the laws and the regulations that the lord established on mount sinai between himself and the israelites through moses the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them if anyone makes a special vow to dedicate persons to the lord by giving equivalent values set the value of a male between the ages of twenty and sixty at fifty shekels of silver according to the sanctuary shekel and if it is a female set her value at thirty shekels if it is a person between the ages of five and twenty set the value of a male at twenty shekels and of a female at ten shekels if it is a person between one month and five years set the value of a male at five shekels of silver and that of a female at three shekels of silver if it is a person sixty years old or more set the value of a male at fifteen shekels and of a female at ten shekels if anyone making the vow is too poor to pay the specified amount he is to present the person to the priest who will set the value for him according to what the man making the vow can afford if what he vowed is an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the lord such an animal given to the lord becomes holy he must not exchange it or substitute a good one for a bad one or a bad one for a good one if he should substitute one animal for another both it and the substitute become holy if what he vowed is a ceremonially unclean animal one that is not acceptable as an offering to the lord the animal must be presented to the priest who will judge its quality as good or bad whatever value the priest then sets that is what it will be if the owner wishes to redeem the animal he must add a fifth to its value if a man dedicates his house as something holy to the lord the priest will judge its quality as good or bad whatever value the priest then sets so it will remain if the man who dedicates his house redeems it he must add a fifth to its value and the house will again become his if a man dedicates to the lord part of his family land its value is to be set according to the amount of seed required for it fifty shekels of silver to a homer of barley seed if he dedicates his field during the year of jubilee the value that has been set remains but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee the priest will determine the value according to the number of years that remain until the next year of jubilee and its set value will be reduced if the man who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it he must add a fifth to its value and the field will again become his if however he does not redeem the field or if he has sold it to someone else it can never be redeemed when the field is released in the jubilee it will become holy like a field devoted to the lord it will become the property of the priests if a man dedicates to the lord a field he has bought which is not part of his family land the priest will determine its value up to the year of jubilee and the man must pay its value on that day as something holy to the lord in the year of jubilee the field will revert to the person from whom he bought it the one whose land it was every value is to be set according to the sanctuary shekel twenty gerahs to the shekel no one however may dedicate the firstborn of an animal since the firstborn already belongs to the lord whether an ox or a sheep it is the lords if it is one of the unclean animals he may buy it back at its set value adding a fifth of the value to it if he does not redeem it it is to be sold at its set value but nothing that a man owns and devotes to the lord whether man or animal or family land may be sold or redeemed everything so devoted is most holy to the lord no person devoted to destruction may be ransomed he must be put to death a tithe of everything from the land whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees belongs to the lord it is holy to the lord if a man redeems any of his tithe he must add a fifth of the value to it the entire tithe of the herd and flock every tenth animal that passes under the shepherds rod will be holy to the lord he must not pick out the good from the bad or make any substitution if he does make a substitution both the animal and its substitute become holy and cannot be redeemed these are the commands the lord gave

is ceremonially unclean because of a dead body send away male and female alike send them outside the camp so they will not defile their camp where i dwell among them the israelites did this they sent them outside the camp they did just as the lord had instructed moses the lord said to moses say to the israelites when a man or woman wrongs another in any way and so is unfaithful to the lord that person is guilty and must confess the sin he has committed he must make full restitution for his wrong add one fifth to it and give it all to the person he has wronged but if that person has no close relative to whom restitution can be made for the wrong the restitution belongs to the lord and must be given to the priest along with the ram with which atonement is made for him all the sacred contributions the israelites bring to a priest will belong to him each mans sacred gifts are his own but what he gives to the priest will belong to the priest then the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them if a mans wife goes astray and is unfaithful to him by sleeping with another man and this is hidden from her husband and her impurity is undetected since there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act and if feelings of jealousy come over her husband and he suspects his wife and she is impure or if he is jealous and suspects her even though she is not impure then he is to take his wife to the priest he must also take an offering of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour on her behalf he must not pour oil on it or put incense on it because it is a grain offering for jealousy a reminder offering to draw attention to guilt the priest shall bring her and have her stand before the lord then he shall take some holy water in a clay jar and put some dust from the tabernacle floor into the water after the priest has had the woman stand before the lord he shall loosen her hair and place in her hands the reminder offering the grain offering for jealousy while he himself holds the bitter water that brings a curse then the priest shall put the woman under oath and say to her if no other man has slept with you and you have not gone astray and become impure while married to your husband may this bitter water that brings a curse not harm you but if you have gone astray while married to your husband and you have defiled yourself by sleeping with a man other than your husband here the priest is to put the woman under this curse of the oath may the lord cause your people to curse and denounce you when he causes your thigh to waste away and your abdomen to swell may this water that brings a curse enter your body so that your abdomen swells and your thigh wastes away then the woman is to say amen so be it the priest is to write these curses on a scroll and then wash them off into the bitter water he shall have the woman drink the bitter water that brings a curse and this water will enter her and cause bitter suffering the priest is to take from her hands the grain offering for jealousy wave it before the lord and bring it to the altar the priest is then to take a handful of the grain offering as a memorial offering and burn it on the altar after that he is to have the woman drink the water if she has defiled herself and been unfaithful to her husband then when she is made to drink the water that brings a curse it will go into her and cause bitter suffering her abdomen will swell and her thigh waste away and she will become accursed among her people if however the woman has not defiled herself and is free from impurity she will be cleared of guilt and will be able to have children this then is the law of jealousy when a woman goes astray and defiles herself while married to her husband or when feelings of jealousy come over a man because he suspects his wife the priest is to have her stand before the lord and is to apply this entire law to her the husband will be innocent of any wrongdoing but the woman will bear the consequences of her sin the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them if a man or woman wants to make a special vow a vow of separation to the lord as a nazirite he must abstain from wine and other fermented drink and must not drink vinegar made from wine or from other fermented drink he must not drink grape juice or eat grapes or raisins as long as he is a nazirite he must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine not even the seeds or skins during the entire period of his vow of separation no razor may be used on his head he must be holy until the period of his separation to the lord is over he must let the hair of his head grow long throughout the period of his separation to the lord he must not go near a dead body even if his own father or mother or brother or sister dies he must not make himself ceremonially unclean on account of them because the symbol of his separation to god is on his head throughout the period of his separation he is consecrated to the lord if someone dies suddenly in his presence thus defiling the hair he has dedicated he must shave his head on the day of his cleansing the seventh day then on the eighth day he must bring two doves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance to the tent of meeting the priest is to offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to make atonement for him because he sinned by being in the presence of the dead body that same day he is to consecrate his head he must dedicate himself to the lord for the period of his separation and must bring a year old male lamb as a guilt offering the previous days do not count because he became defiled during his separation now this is the law for the nazirite when the period of his separation is over he is to be brought to the entrance to the tent of meeting there he is to present his offerings to the lord a year old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering a year old ewe lamb without defect for a sin offering a ram without defect for a fellowship offering together with their grain offerings and drink offerings and a basket of bread made without yeast cakes made of fine flour mixed with oil and wafers spread with oil the priest is to present them before the lord and make the sin offering and the burnt offering he is to present the basket of unleavened bread and is to sacrifice the ram as a fellowship offering to the lord together with its grain offering and drink offering then at the entrance to the tent of meeting the nazirite must shave off the hair that he dedicated he is to take the hair and put it in the fire that is under the sacrifice of the fellowship offering after the nazirite has shaved off the hair of his dedication the priest is to place in his hands a boiled shoulder of the ram and a cake and a wafer from the basket both made without yeast the priest shall then wave them before the lord as a wave offering they are holy and belong to the priest together with the breast that was waved and the thigh that was presented after that the nazirite may drink wine this is the law of the nazirite who vows his offering to the lord in accordance with his separation in addition to whatever else he can afford he must fulfill the vow he has made according to the law of the nazirite the lord said to moses tell aaron and his sons this is how you are to bless the israelites say to them the lord bless you and keep you the lord make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you the lord turn his face toward you and give you peace so they will put my name on the israelites and i will bless them when moses finished setting up the tabernacle he anointed it and consecrated it and all its furnishings he also anointed and consecrated the altar and all its utensils then the leaders of israel the heads of families who were the tribal leaders in charge of those who were counted made offerings they brought as their gifts before the lord six covered carts and twelve oxen an ox from each leader and a cart from every two these they presented before the tabernacle the lord said to moses accept these from them that they may be used in the work at the tent of meeting

four carts and eight oxen to the merarites as their work required they were all under the direction of ithamar son of aaron the priest but moses did not give any to the kohathites because they were to

are to light the area in front of the lampstand aaron did so he set up the lamps so that they faced forward on the lampstand just as the lord commanded moses this is how the lampstand was made it was made of hammered gold from its base to its blossoms the lampstand was made exactly like the pattern the lord had shown moses the lord said to moses take the levites from among the other israelites and make them ceremonially clean to purify them do this sprinkle the water of cleansing on them then have them shave their whole bodies and wash their clothes and so purify themselves have them take a

the other israelites and the levites will be mine after you have purified the levites and presented them as a wave offering they are to come to do their work at the tent of meeting they are the israelites who are to be given wholly to me i have taken them as my own in place of the firstborn the first male offspring from every israelite woman every firstborn male in israel whether man or animal is mine when i struck down all the firstborn in egypt i set them apart for myself and i have taken the levites in place of all the firstborn sons in israel of all the israelites i have given the levites as gifts to aaron and his sons to do the work at the tent of meeting on behalf of the israelites and to make atonement for them so that no plague will strike the israelites when they go near the sanctuary moses aaron and the whole israelite community did with the levites just as the lord commanded moses the levites purified themselves and washed their clothes then aaron presented them as a wave offering before the lord and made atonement for them to purify them after that the levites came to do their work at the tent of meeting under the supervision of aaron and his sons they did with the levites just as the lord commanded moses the lord said to moses this applies to the levites men twenty five years old or more shall come to take part in the work at the tent of meeting but at the age of fifty they must retire from their regular service and work no longer they may assist their brothers in performing their duties at the tent of meeting but they themselves must not do the work this then is how you are to assign the responsibilities of the levites the lord spoke to moses in the desert of sinai in the first month of the second year after they came out of egypt he said have the israelites celebrate the passover at the appointed time celebrate it at the appointed time at twilight on the fourteenth day of this month in accordance with all its rules and regulations so moses told the israelites to celebrate the passover and they did so in the desert of sinai at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month the israelites did everything just as the lord commanded moses but some of them could not celebrate the passover on that day because they were ceremonially unclean on account of a dead body so they came to moses and aaron that same day and said to moses we have become unclean because of a dead body but why should we be kept from presenting the lords offering with the other israelites at the appointed time moses answered them wait until i find out what the lord commands concerning you then the lord said to moses tell the israelites when any of you or your descendants are unclean because of a dead body or are away on a journey they may still celebrate the lords passover they are to celebrate it on the fourteenth day of the second month at twilight they are to eat the lamb together with unleavened bread and bitter herbs they must not leave any of it till morning or break any of its bones when they celebrate the passover they must follow all the regulations but if a man who is ceremonially clean and not on a journey fails to celebrate the passover that person must be cut off from his people because he did not present the lords offering at the appointed time that man will bear the consequences of his sin an alien living among you who wants to celebrate the lords passover must do so in accordance with its rules and regulations you must have the same regulations for the alien and the native born on the day the tabernacle the tent of the testimony was set up the cloud covered it from evening till morning the cloud above the tabernacle looked like fire that is how it continued to be the cloud covered it and at night it looked like fire whenever the cloud lifted from above the tent the israelites set out wherever the cloud settled the israelites encamped at the lords command the israelites set out and at his command they encamped as long as the cloud stayed over the tabernacle they remained in camp when the cloud remained over the tabernacle a long time the israelites obeyed the lords order and did not set out sometimes the cloud was over the tabernacle only a few days at the lords command they would encamp and then at his command they would set out sometimes the cloud stayed only from evening till morning and when it lifted in the morning they set out whether by day or by night whenever the cloud lifted they set out whether the cloud stayed over the tabernacle for two days or a month or a year the israelites would remain in camp and not set out but when it lifted they would set out at the lords command they encamped and at the lords command they set out they obeyed the lords order in accordance with his command through moses the lord said to moses make two trumpets of hammered silver and use them for calling the community together and for having the camps set out when both are sounded the whole community is to assemble before you at the entrance to the tent of meeting if only one is sounded the leaders the heads of the clans of israel are to assemble before you when a trumpet blast is sounded the tribes camping on the east are to set out at the sounding of a second blast the camps on the south are to set out the blast will be the signal for setting out to gather the assembly blow the trumpets but not with the same signal the sons of aaron the priests are to blow the trumpets this is to be a lasting ordinance for you and the generations to come when you go into battle in your own land against an enemy who is oppressing you sound a blast on the trumpets then you will be remembered by the lord your god and rescued from your enemies also at your times of rejoicing your appointed feasts and new moon festivals you are to sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings and fellowship offerings and they will be a memorial for you before your god i am the lord your god on the twentieth day of the second month of the second year the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle of the testimony then the israelites set out from the desert of sinai and traveled from place to place until the cloud came to rest in the desert of paran they set out this first time at the lords command through moses the divisions of the camp of judah went first under their standard nahshon son of amminadab was in command nethanel son of zuar was over the division of the tribe of issachar and eliab son of helon was over the division of the tribe of zebulun then the tabernacle was taken down and the gershonites and merarites who carried it set out the divisions of the camp of reuben went next under their standard elizur son of shedeur was in command shelumiel son of zurishaddai was over the division of the tribe of simeon and eliasaph son of deuel was over the division of the tribe of gad then the kohathites set out carrying the holy things the tabernacle was to be set up before they arrived the divisions of the camp of ephraim went next under their standard elishama son of ammihud was in command gamaliel son of pedahzur was over the division of the tribe of manasseh and abidan son of gideoni was over the division of the tribe of benjamin finally as the rear guard for all the units the divisions of the camp of dan set out under their standard ahiezer son of ammishaddai was in command pagiel son of ocran was over the division of the tribe of asher and ahira son of enan was over the division of the tribe of naphtali this was the order of march for the israelite divisions as they set out now moses said to hobab son of reuel the midianite moses father in law we are setting out for the place about which the lord said i will give it to you come with us and we will treat you well for the lord has promised good things to israel he answered no i will not go i am going back to my own land and my own people but moses said please do not leave us you know where we should camp in the desert and you can be our eyes if you come with us we will share with you whatever good things the lord gives us so they set out from the mountain of the lord and traveled for three days the ark of the covenant of the lord went before them during those three days to find them a place to rest the cloud of the lord was over them by day when they set out from the camp whenever the ark set out moses said rise up o lord may your enemies be scattered may your foes flee before you whenever it came to rest he said return o lord to the countless thousands of israel now the people complained about their hardships in the hearing of the lord and when he heard them his anger was aroused then fire from the lord burned among them and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp when the people cried out to moses he prayed to the lord and the fire died down so that place was called taberah because fire from the lord had burned among them quail from the lord the rabble with them began to crave other food and again the israelites started wailing and said if only we had meat to eat we remember the fish we ate in egypt at no cost also the cucumbers melons leeks onions and garlic but now we have lost our appetite we never see anything but this manna the manna was like coriander seed and looked like resin the people went around gathering it and then ground it in a handmill or crushed it in a mortar they cooked it in a pot or made it into cakes and it tasted like something made with olive oil when the dew settled on the camp at night the manna also came down moses heard the people of every family wailing each at the entrance to his tent the lord became exceedingly angry and moses was troubled he asked the lord why have you brought this trouble on your servant what have i done to displease you that you put the burden of all these people on me did i conceive all these people did i give them birth why do you tell me to carry them in my arms as a nurse carries an infant to the land you promised on oath to their forefathers where can i get meat for all these people they keep wailing to me give us meat to eat i cannot carry all these people by myself the burden is too heavy for me if this is how you are going to treat me put me to death right now if i have found favor in your eyes and do not let me face my own ruin the lord said to moses bring me seventy of israels elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people have them come to the tent of meeting that they may stand there with you i will come down and speak with you there and i will take of the spirit that is on you and put the spirit on them they will help you carry the burden of the people so that you will not have to carry it alone tell the people consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow when you will eat meat the lord heard you when you wailed if only we had meat to eat we were better off in egypt now the lord will give you meat and you will eat it you will not eat it for just one day or two days or five ten or twenty days but for a whole month until it comes out of your nostrils and you loathe it because you have rejected the lord who is among you and have wailed before him saying why did we ever leave egypt but moses said here i am among six hundred thousand men on foot and you say i will give them meat to eat for a whole month would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them the lord answered moses is the lords arm too short you will now see whether or not what i say will come true for you so moses went out and told the people what the lord had said he brought together seventy of their elders and had them stand around the tent then the lord came down in the cloud and spoke with him and he took of the spirit that was on him and put the spirit on the seventy elders when the spirit rested on them they prophesied but they did not do so again however two men whose names were eldad and medad had remained in the camp they were listed among the elders but did not go out to the tent yet the spirit also rested on them and they prophesied in the camp a young man ran and told moses eldad and medad are prophesying in the camp joshua son of nun who had been moses aide since youth spoke up and said moses my lord stop them but moses replied are you jealous for my sake i wish that all the lords people were prophets and that the lord would put his spirit on them then moses and the elders of israel returned to the camp now a wind went out from the lord and drove quail in from the sea it brought them down all around the camp to about three feet above the ground as far as a days walk in any direction all that day and night and all the next day the people went out and gathered quail no one gathered less than ten homers then they spread them out all around the camp but while the meat was still between their teeth and before it could be consumed the anger of the lord burned against the people and he struck them with a severe plague therefore the place was named kibroth hattaavah because there they buried the people who had craved other food from kibroth hattaavah the people traveled to hazeroth and stayed there miriam and aaron began to talk against moses because of his cushite wife for he had married a cushite has the lord spoken only through moses they asked hasnt he also spoken through us and the lord heard this now moses was a very humble man more humble than anyone else on the face of the earth at once the lord said to moses aaron and miriam come out to the tent of meeting all three of you so the three of them came out then the lord came down in a pillar of cloud he stood at the entrance to the tent and summoned aaron and miriam when both of them stepped forward he said listen to my words when a prophet of the lord is among you i reveal myself to him in visions i speak to him in dreams but this is not true of my servant moses he is faithful in all my house with him i speak face to face clearly and not in riddles he sees the form of the lord why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant moses the anger of the lord burned against them and he left them when the cloud lifted from above the tent there stood miriam leprous like snow aaron turned toward her and saw that she had leprosy and he said to moses please my lord do not hold against us the sin we have so foolishly committed do not let her be like a stillborn infant coming from its mothers womb with its flesh half eaten away so moses cried out to the lord o god please heal her the lord replied to moses if her father had spit in her face would she not have been in disgrace for seven days confine her outside the camp for seven days after that she can be brought back so miriam was confined outside the camp for seven days and the people did not move on till she was brought back after that the people left hazeroth and encamped in the desert of paran the lord said to moses send some men to explore the land of canaan which i am giving to the israelites from each ancestral tribe send one of its leaders so at the lords command moses sent them out from the desert of paran all of them were leaders of the israelites these are their names from the tribe of reuben shammua son of zaccur from the tribe of simeon shaphat son of hori from the tribe of judah caleb son of jephunneh from the tribe of issachar igal son of joseph from the tribe of ephraim hoshea son of nun from the tribe of benjamin palti son of raphu from the tribe of zebulun gaddiel son of sodi from the tribe of manasseh a tribe of joseph gaddi son of susi from the tribe of dan ammiel son of gemalli from the tribe of asher sethur son of michael from the tribe of naphtali nahbi son of vophsi from the tribe of gad geuel son of maki these are the names of the men moses sent to explore the land moses gave hoshea son of nun the name joshua when moses sent them to explore canaan he said go up through the negev and on into the hill country see what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak few or many what kind of land do they live in is it good or bad what kind of towns do they live in are they unwalled or fortified how is the soil is it fertile or poor are there trees on it or not do your best to bring back some of the fruit of the land it was the season for the first ripe grapes so they went up and explored the land from the desert of zin as far as rehob toward lebo hamath they went up through the negev and came to hebron where ahiman sheshai and talmai the descendants of anak lived hebron had been built seven years before zoan in egypt when they reached the valley of eshcol they cut off a branch bearing a single cluster of grapes two of them carried it on a pole between them along with some pomegranates and figs that place was called the valley of eshcol because of the cluster of grapes the israelites cut off there at the end of forty days they returned from exploring the land they came back to moses and aaron and the whole israelite community at kadesh in the desert of paran there they reported to them and to the whole assembly and showed them the fruit of the land they gave moses this account we went into the land to which you sent us and it does flow with milk and honey here is its fruit but the people who live there are powerful and the cities are fortified and very large we even saw descendants of anak there the amalekites live in the negev the hittites jebusites and amorites live in the hill country and the canaanites live near the sea and along the jordan then caleb silenced the people before moses and said we should go up and take possession of the land for we can certainly do it but the men who had gone up with him said we cant attack those people they are stronger than we are and they spread among the israelites a bad report about the land they had explored they said the land we explored devours those living in it all the people we saw there are of great size we saw the nephilim there the descendants of anak come from the nephilim we seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes and we looked the same to them that night all the people of the community raised their voices and wept aloud all the israelites grumbled against moses and aaron and the whole assembly said to them if only we had died in egypt or in this desert why is the lord bringing us to this land only to let us fall by the sword our wives and children will be taken as plunder wouldnt it be better for us to go back to egypt and they said to each other we should choose a leader and go back to egypt then moses and aaron fell facedown in front of the whole israelite assembly gathered there joshua son of nun and caleb son of jephunneh who were among those who had explored the land tore their clothes and said to the entire israelite assembly the land we passed through and explored is exceedingly good if the lord is pleased with us he will lead us into that land a land flowing with milk and honey and will give it to us only do not rebel against the lord and do not be afraid of the people of the land because we will swallow them up their protection is gone but the lord is with us do not be afraid of them but the whole assembly talked about stoning them then the glory of the lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all the israelites the lord said to moses how long will these people treat me with contempt how long will they refuse to believe in me in spite of all the miraculous signs i have performed among them i will strike them down with a plague and destroy them but i will make you into a nation greater and stronger than they moses said to the lord then the egyptians will hear about it by your power you brought these people up from among them and they will tell the inhabitants of this land about it they have already heard that you o lord are with these people and that you o lord have been seen face to face that your cloud stays over them and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night if you put these people to death all at one time the nations who have heard this report about you will say the lord was not able to bring these people into the land he promised them on oath so he slaughtered them in the desert now may the lords strength be displayed just as you have declared the lord is slow to anger abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion yet he does not leave the guilty unpunished he punishes the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation in accordance with your great love forgive the sin of these people just as you have pardoned them from the time they left egypt until now the lord replied i have forgiven them as you asked nevertheless as surely as i live and as surely as the glory of the lord fills the whole earth not one of the men who saw my glory and the miraculous signs i performed in egypt and in the desert but who disobeyed me and tested me ten times not one of them will ever see the land i promised on oath to their forefathers no one who has treated me with contempt will ever see it but because my servant caleb has a different spirit and follows me wholeheartedly i will bring him into the land he went to and his descendants will inherit it since the amalekites and canaanites are living in the valleys turn back tomorrow and set out toward the desert along the route to the red sea the lord said to moses and aaron how long will this wicked community grumble against me i have heard the complaints of these grumbling israelites so tell them as surely as i live declares the lord i will do to you the very things i heard you say in this desert your bodies will fall every one of you twenty years old or more who was counted in the census and who has grumbled against me not one of you will enter the land i swore with uplifted hand to make your home except caleb son of jephunneh and joshua son of nun as for your children that you said would be taken as plunder i will bring them in to enjoy the land you have rejected but you your bodies will fall in this desert your children will be shepherds here for forty years suffering for your unfaithfulness until the last of your bodies lies in the desert for forty years one year for each of the forty days you explored the land you will suffer for your sins and know what it is like to have me against you i the lord have spoken and i will surely do these things to this whole wicked community which has banded together against me they will meet their end in this desert here they will die so the men moses had sent to explore the land who returned and made the whole community grumble against him by spreading a bad report about it these men responsible for spreading the bad report about the land were struck down and died of a plague before the lord of the men who went to explore the land only joshua son of nun and caleb son of jephunneh survived when moses reported this to all the israelites they mourned bitterly early the next morning they went up toward the high hill country we have sinned they said we will go up to the place the lord promised but moses said why are you disobeying the lords command this will not succeed do not go up because the lord is not with you you will be defeated by your enemies for the amalekites and canaanites will face you there because you have turned away from the lord he will not be with you and you will fall by the sword nevertheless in their presumption they went up toward the high hill country though neither moses nor the ark of the lords covenant moved from the camp then the amalekites and canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and attacked them and beat them down all the way to hormah the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them after you enter the land i am giving you as a home and you present to the lord offerings made by fire from the herd or the flock as an aroma pleasing to the lord whether burnt offerings or sacrifices for special vows or freewill offerings or festival offerings then the one who brings his offering shall present to the lord a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a quarter of a hin of oil with each lamb for the burnt offering or the sacrifice prepare a quarter of a hin of wine as a drink offering with a ram prepare a grain offering of two tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil and a third of a hin of wine as a drink offering offer it as an aroma pleasing to the lord when you prepare a young bull as a burnt offering or sacrifice for a special vow or a fellowship offering to the lord bring with the bull a grain offering of three tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil also bring half a hin of wine as a drink offering it will be an offering made by fire an aroma pleasing to the lord each bull or ram each lamb or young goat is to be prepared in this manner do this for each one for as many as you prepare everyone who is native born must do these things in this way when he brings an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the lord for the generations to come whenever an alien or anyone else living among you presents an offering made by fire as an aroma pleasing to the lord he must do exactly as you do the community is to have the same rules for you and for the alien living among you this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come you and the alien shall be the same before the lord the same laws and regulations will apply both to you and to the alien living among you the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them when you enter the land to which i am taking you and you eat the food of the land present a portion as an offering to the lord present a cake from the first of your ground meal and present it as an offering from the threshing floor throughout the generations to come you are to give this offering to the lord from the first of your ground meal now if you unintentionally fail to keep any of these commands the lord gave moses any of the lords commands to you through him from the day the lord gave them and continuing through the generations to come and if this is done unintentionally without the community being aware of it then the whole community is to offer a young bull for a burnt offering as an aroma pleasing to the lord along with its prescribed grain offering and drink offering and a male goat for a sin offering the priest is to make atonement for the whole israelite community and they will be forgiven for it was not intentional and they have brought to the lord for their wrong an offering made by fire and a sin offering the whole israelite community and the aliens living among them will be forgiven because all the people were involved in the unintentional wrong but if just one person sins unintentionally he must bring a year old female goat for a sin offering the priest is to make atonement before the lord for the one who erred by sinning unintentionally and when atonement has been made for him he will be forgiven one and the same law applies to everyone who sins unintentionally whether he is a native born israelite or an alien but anyone who sins defiantly whether native born or alien blasphemes the lord and that person must be cut off from his people because he has despised the lords word and broken his commands that person must surely be cut off his guilt remains on him while the israelites were in the desert a man was found gathering wood on the sabbath day those who found him gathering wood brought him to moses and aaron and the whole assembly and they kept him in custody because it was not clear what should be done to him then the lord said to moses the man must die the whole assembly must stone him outside the camp so the assembly took him outside the camp and stoned him to death as the lord commanded moses the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them throughout the generations to come you are to make tassels on the corners of your garments with a blue cord on each tassel you will have these tassels to look at and so you will remember all the commands of the lord that you may obey them and not prostitute yourselves by going after the lusts of your own hearts and eyes then you will remember to obey all my commands and will be consecrated to your god i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt to be your god i am the lord your god korah son of izhar the son of kohath the son of levi and certain reubenites dathan and abiram sons of eliab and on son of peleth became insolent and rose up against moses with them were 250 israelite men well known community leaders who had been appointed members of the council they came as a group to oppose moses and aaron and said to them you have gone too far the whole community is holy every one of them and the lord is with them why then do you set yourselves above the lords assembly when moses heard this he fell facedown then he said to korah and all his followers in the morning the lord will show who belongs to him and who is holy and he will have that person come near him the man he chooses he will cause to come near him you korah and all your followers are to do this take censers and tomorrow put fire and incense in them before the lord the man the lord chooses will be the one who is holy you levites have gone too far moses also said to korah now listen you levites isnt it enough for you that the god of israel has separated you from the rest of the israelite community and brought you near himself to do the work at the lords tabernacle and to stand before the community and minister to them he has brought you and all your fellow levites near himself but now you are trying to get the priesthood too it is against the lord that you and all your followers have banded together who is aaron that you should grumble against him then moses summoned dathan and abiram the sons of eliab but they said we will not come isnt it enough that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the desert and now you also want to lord it over us moreover you havent brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey or given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards will you gouge out the eyes of these men no we will not come then moses became very angry and said to the lord do not accept their offering i have not taken so much as a donkey from them nor have i wronged any of them moses said to korah you and all your followers are to appear before the lord tomorrow you and they and aaron each man is to take his censer and put incense in it 250 censers in all and present it before the lord you and aaron are to present your censers also so each man took his censer put fire and incense in it and stood with moses and aaron at the entrance to the tent of meeting when korah had gathered all his followers in opposition to them at the entrance to the tent of meeting the glory of the lord appeared to the entire assembly the lord said to moses and aaron separate yourselves from this assembly so i can put an end to them at once but moses and aaron fell facedown and cried out o god god of the spirits of all mankind will you be angry with the entire assembly when only one man sins then the lord said to moses say to the assembly move away from the tents of korah dathan and abiram moses got up and went to dathan and abiram and the elders of israel followed him he warned the assembly move back from the tents of these wicked men do not touch anything belonging to them or you will be swept away because of all their sins so they moved away from the tents of korah dathan and abiram dathan and abiram had come out and were standing with their wives children and little ones at the entrances to their tents then moses said this is how you will know that the lord has sent me to do all these things and that it was not my idea if these men die a natural death and experience only what usually happens to men then the lord has not sent me but if the lord brings about something totally new and the earth opens its mouth and swallows them with everything that belongs to them and they go down alive into the grave then you will know that these men have treated the lord with contempt as soon as he finished saying all this the ground under them split apart and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them with their households and all korahs men and all their possessions they went down alive into the grave with everything they owned the earth closed over them and they perished and were gone from the community at their cries all the israelites around them fled shouting the earth is going to swallow us too and fire came out from the lord and consumed the 250 men who were offering the incense the lord said to moses tell eleazar son of aaron the priest to take the censers out of the smoldering remains and scatter the coals some distance away for the censers are holy the censers of the men who sinned at the cost of their lives hammer the censers into sheets to overlay the altar for they were presented before the lord and have become holy let them be a sign to the israelites so eleazar the priest collected the bronze censers brought by those who had been burned up and he had them hammered out to overlay the altar as the lord directed him through moses this was to remind the israelites that no one except a descendant of aaron should come to burn incense before the lord or he would become like korah and his followers the next day the whole israelite community grumbled against moses and aaron you have killed the lords people they said but when the assembly gathered in opposition to moses and aaron and turned toward the tent of meeting suddenly the cloud covered it and the glory of the lord appeared then moses and aaron went to the front of the tent of meeting and the lord said to moses get away from this assembly so i can put an end to them at once and they fell facedown then moses said to aaron take your censer and put incense in it along with fire from the altar and hurry to the assembly to make atonement for them wrath has come out from the lord the plague has started so aaron did as moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly the plague had already started among the people but aaron offered the incense and made atonement for them he stood between the living and the dead and the plague stopped but 14700 people died from the plague in addition to those who had died because of korah then aaron returned to moses at the entrance to the tent of meeting for the plague had stopped the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and get twelve staffs from them one from the leader of each of their ancestral tribes write the name of each man on his staff on the staff of levi write aarons name for there must be one staff for the head of each ancestral tribe place them in the tent of meeting in front of the testimony where i meet with you the staff belonging to the man i choose will sprout and i will rid myself of this constant grumbling against you by the israelites so moses spoke to the israelites and their leaders gave him twelve staffs one for the leader of each of their ancestral tribes and aarons staff was among them moses placed the staffs before the lord in the tent of the testimony the next day moses entered the tent of the testimony and saw that aarons staff which represented the house of levi had not only sprouted but had budded blossomed and produced almonds then moses brought out all the staffs from the lords presence to all the israelites they looked at them and each man took his own staff the lord said to moses put back aarons staff in front of the testimony to be kept as a sign to the rebellious this will put an end to their grumbling against me so that they will not die moses did just as the lord commanded him the israelites said to moses we will die we are lost we are all lost anyone who even comes near the tabernacle of the lord will die are we all going to die the lord said to aaron you your sons and your fathers family are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the sanctuary and you and your sons alone are to bear the responsibility for offenses against the priesthood bring your fellow levites from your ancestral tribe to join you and assist you when you and your sons minister before the tent of the testimony they are to be responsible to you and are to perform all the duties of the tent but they must not go near the furnishings of the sanctuary or the altar or both they and you will die they are to join you and be responsible for the care of the tent of meeting all the work at the tent and no one else may come near where you are you are to be responsible for the care of the sanctuary and the altar so that wrath will not fall on the israelites again i myself have selected your fellow levites from among the israelites as a gift to you dedicated to the lord to do the work at the tent of meeting but only you and your sons may serve as priests in connection with everything at the altar and inside the curtain i am giving you the service of the priesthood as a gift anyone else who comes near the sanctuary must be put to death then the lord said to aaron i myself have put you in charge of the offerings presented to me all the holy offerings the israelites give me i give to you and your sons as your portion and regular share you are to have the part of the most holy offerings that is kept from the fire from all the gifts they bring me as most holy offerings whether grain or sin or guilt offerings that part belongs to you and your sons eat it as something most holy every male shall eat it you must regard it as holy this also is yours whatever is set aside from the gifts of all the wave offerings of the israelites i give this to you and your sons and daughters as your regular share everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it i give you all the finest olive oil and all the finest new wine and grain they give the lord as the firstfruits of their harvest all the lands firstfruits that they bring to the lord will be yours everyone in your household who is ceremonially clean may eat it everything in israel that is devoted to the lord is yours the first offspring of every womb both man and animal that is offered to the lord is yours but you must redeem every firstborn son and every firstborn male of unclean animals when they are a month old you must redeem them at the redemption price set at five shekels of silver according to the sanctuary shekel which weighs twenty gerahs but you must not redeem the firstborn of an ox a sheep or a goat they are holy sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat as an offering made by fire an aroma pleasing to the lord their meat is to be yours just as the breast of the wave offering and the right thigh are yours whatever is set aside from the holy offerings the israelites present to the lord i give to you and your sons and daughters as your regular share it is an everlasting covenant of salt before the lord for both you and your offspring the lord said to aaron you will have no inheritance in their land nor will you have any share among them i am your share and your inheritance among the israelites i give to the levites all the tithes in israel as their inheritance in return for the work they do while serving at the tent of meeting from now on the israelites must not go near the tent of meeting or they will bear the consequences of their sin and will die it is the levites who are to do the work at the tent of meeting and bear the responsibility for offenses against it this is a lasting ordinance for the generations to come they will receive no inheritance among the israelites instead i give to the levites as their inheritance the tithes that the israelites present as an offering to the lord that is why i said concerning them they will have no inheritance among the israelites the lord said to moses speak to the levites and say to them when you receive from the israelites the tithe i give you as your inheritance you must present a tenth of that tithe as the lords offering your offering will be reckoned to you as grain from the threshing floor or juice from the winepress in this way you also will present an offering to the lord from all the tithes you receive from the israelites from these tithes you must give the lords portion to aaron the priest you must present as the lords portion the best and holiest part of everything given to you say to the levites when you present the best part it will be reckoned to you as the product of the threshing floor or the winepress you and your households may eat the rest of it anywhere for it is your wages for your work at the tent of meeting by presenting the best part of it you will not be guilty in this matter then you will not defile the holy offerings of the israelites and you will not die the lord said to moses and aaron this is a requirement of the law that the lord has commanded tell the israelites to bring you a red heifer without defect or blemish and that has never been under a yoke give it to eleazar the priest it is to be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence then eleazar the priest is to take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the tent of meeting while he watches the heifer is to be burned its hide flesh blood and offal the priest is to take some cedar wood hyssop and scarlet wool and throw them onto the burning heifer after that the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself with water he may then come into the camp but he will be ceremonially unclean till evening the man who burns it must also wash his clothes and bathe with water and he too will be unclean till evening a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer and put them in a ceremonially clean place outside the camp they shall be kept by the israelite community for use in the water of cleansing it is for purification from sin the man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes and he too will be unclean till evening this will be a lasting ordinance both for the israelites and for the aliens living among them whoever touches the dead body of anyone will be unclean for seven days he must purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day then he will be clean but if he does not purify himself on the third and seventh days he will not be clean whoever touches the dead body of anyone and fails to purify himself defiles the lords tabernacle that person must be cut off from israel because the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him he is unclean his uncleanness remains on him this is the law that applies when a person dies in a tent anyone who enters the tent and anyone who is in it will be unclean for seven days and every open container without a lid fastened on it will be unclean anyone out in the open who touches someone who has been killed with a sword or someone who has died a natural death or anyone who touches a human bone or a grave will be unclean for seven days for the unclean person put some ashes from the burned purification offering into a jar and pour fresh water over them then a man who is ceremonially clean is to take some hyssop dip it in the water and sprinkle the tent and all the furnishings and the people who were there he must also sprinkle anyone who has touched a human bone or a grave or someone who has been killed or someone who has died a natural death the man who is clean is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third and seventh days and on the seventh day he is to purify him the person being cleansed must wash his clothes and bathe with water and that evening he will be clean but if a person who is unclean does not purify himself he must be cut off from the community because he has defiled the sanctuary of the lord the water of cleansing has not been sprinkled on him and he is unclean this is a lasting ordinance for them the man who sprinkles the water of cleansing must also wash his clothes and anyone who touches the water of cleansing will be unclean till evening anything that an unclean person touches becomes unclean and anyone who touches it becomes unclean till evening in the first month the whole israelite community arrived at the desert of zin and they stayed at kadesh there miriam died and was buried now there was no water for the community and the people gathered in opposition to moses and aaron they quarreled with moses and said if only we had died when our brothers fell dead before the lord why did you bring the lords community into this desert that we and our livestock should die here why did you bring us up out of egypt to this terrible place it has no grain or figs grapevines or pomegranates and there is no water to drink moses and aaron went from the assembly to the entrance to the tent of meeting and fell facedown and the glory of the lord appeared to them the lord said to moses take the staff and you and your brother aaron gather the assembly together speak to that rock before their eyes and it will pour out its water you will bring water out of the rock for the community so they and their livestock can drink so moses took the staff from the lords presence just as he commanded him he and aaron gathered the assembly together in front of the rock and moses said to them listen you rebels must we bring you water out of this rock then moses raised his arm and struck the rock twice with his staff water gushed out and the community and their livestock drank but the lord said to moses and aaron because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the israelites you will not bring this community into the land i give them these were the waters of meribah where the israelites quarreled with the lord and where he showed himself holy among them moses sent messengers from kadesh to the king of edom saying this is what your brother israel says you know about all the hardships that have come upon us our forefathers went down into egypt and we lived there many years the egyptians mistreated us and our fathers but when we cried out to the lord he heard our cry and sent an angel and brought us out of egypt now we are here at kadesh a town on the edge of your territory please let us pass through your country we will not go through any field or vineyard or drink water from any well we will travel along the kings highway and not turn to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory but edom answered you may not pass through here if you try we will march out and attack you with the sword the israelites replied we will go along the main road and if we or our livestock drink any of your water we will pay for it we only want to pass through on foot nothing else again they answered you may not pass through then edom came out against them with a large and powerful army since edom refused to let them go through their territory israel turned away from them the whole israelite community set out from kadesh and came to mount hor at mount hor near the border of edom the lord said to moses and aaron aaron will be gathered to his people he will not enter the land i give the israelites because both of you rebelled against my command at the waters of meribah get aaron and his son eleazar and take them up mount hor remove aarons garments and put them on his son eleazar for aaron will be gathered to his people he will die there moses did as the lord commanded they went up mount hor in the sight of the whole community moses removed aarons garments and put them on his son eleazar and aaron died there on top of the mountain then moses and eleazar came down from the mountain and when the whole community learned that aaron had died the entire house of israel mourned for him thirty days when the canaanite king of arad who lived in the negev heard that israel was coming along the road to atharim he attacked the israelites and captured some of them then israel made this vow to the lord if you will deliver these people into our hands we will totally destroy their cities the lord listened to israels plea and gave the canaanites over to them they completely destroyed them and their towns so the place was named hormah they traveled from mount hor along the route to the red sea to go around edom but the people grew impatient on the way they spoke against god and against moses and said why have you brought us up out of egypt to die in the desert there is no bread there is no water and we detest this miserable food then the lord sent venomous snakes among them they bit the people and many israelites died the people came to moses and said we sinned when we spoke against the lord and against you pray that the lord will take the snakes away from us so moses prayed for the people the lord said to moses make a snake and put it up on a pole anyone who is bitten can look at it and live so moses made a bronze snake and put it up on a pole then when anyone was bitten by a snake and looked at the bronze snake he lived the israelites moved on and camped at oboth then they set out from oboth and camped in iye abarim in the desert that faces moab toward the sunrise from there they moved on and camped in the zered valley they set out from there and camped alongside the arnon which is in the desert extending into amorite territory the arnon is the border of moab between moab and the amorites that is why the book of the wars of the lord says waheb in suphah and the ravines the arnon and the slopes of the ravines that lead to the site of ar and lie along the border of moab from there they continued on to beer the well where the lord said to moses gather the people together and i will give them water then israel sang this song spring up o well sing about it about the well that the princes dug that the nobles of the people sank the nobles with scepters and staffs then they went from the desert to mattanah from mattanah to nahaliel from nahaliel to bamoth and from bamoth to the valley in moab where the top of pisgah overlooks the wasteland israel sent messengers to say to sihon king of the amorites let us pass through your country we will not turn aside into any field or vineyard or drink water from any well we will travel along the kings highway until we have passed through your territory but sihon would not let israel pass through his territory he mustered his entire army and marched out into the desert against israel when he reached jahaz he fought with israel israel however put him to the sword and took over his land from the arnon to the jabbok but only as far as the ammonites because their border was fortified israel captured all the cities of the amorites and occupied them including heshbon and all its surrounding settlements heshbon was the city of sihon king of the amorites who had fought against the former king of moab and had taken from him all his land as far as the arnon that is why the poets say come to heshbon and let it be rebuilt let sihons city be restored fire went out from heshbon a blaze from the city of sihon it consumed ar of moab the citizens of arnons heights woe to you o moab you are destroyed o people of chemosh he has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters as captives to sihon king of the amorites but we have overthrown them heshbon is destroyed all the way to dibon we have demolished them as far as nophah which extends to medeba so israel settled in the land of the amorites after moses had sent spies to jazer the israelites captured its surrounding settlements and drove out the amorites who were there then they turned and went up along the road toward bashan and og king of bashan and his whole army marched out to meet them in battle at edrei the lord said to moses do not be afraid of him for i have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land do to him what you did to sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon so they struck him down together with his sons and his whole army leaving them no survivors and they took possession of his land then the israelites traveled to the plains of moab and camped along the jordan across from jericho now balak son of zippor saw all that israel had done to the amorites and moab was terrified because there were so many people indeed moab was filled with dread because of the israelites the moabites said to the elders of midian this horde is going to lick up everything around us as an ox licks up the grass of the field so balak son of zippor who was king of moab at that time sent messengers to summon balaam son of beor who was at pethor near the river in his native land balak said a people has come out of egypt they cover the face of the land and have settled next to me now come and put a curse on these people because they are too powerful for me perhaps then i will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the country for i know that those you bless are blessed and those you curse are cursed the elders of moab and midian left taking with them the fee for divination when they came to balaam they told him what balak had said spend the night here balaam said to them and i will bring you back the answer the lord gives me so the moabite princes stayed with him god came to balaam and asked who are these men with you balaam said to god balak son of zippor king of moab sent me this message a people that has come out of egypt covers the face of the land now come and put a curse on them for me perhaps then i will be able to fight them and drive them away but god said to balaam do not go with them you must not put a curse on those people because they are blessed the next morning balaam got up and said to balaks princes go back to your own country for the lord has refused to let me go with you so the moabite princes returned to balak and said balaam refused to come with us then balak sent other princes more numerous and more distinguished than the first they came to balaam and said this is what balak son of zippor says do not let anything keep you from coming to me because i will reward you handsomely and do whatever you say come and put a curse on these people for me but balaam answered them even if balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold i could not do anything great or small to go beyond the command of the lord my god now stay here tonight as the others did and i will find out what else the lord will tell me that night god came to balaam and said since these men have come to summon you go with them but do only what i tell you balaam got up in the morning saddled his donkey and went with the princes of moab but god was very angry when he went and the angel of the lord stood in the road to oppose him balaam was riding on his donkey and his two servants were with him when the donkey saw the angel of the lord standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand she turned off the road into a field balaam beat her to get her back on the road then the angel of the lord stood in a narrow path between two vineyards with walls on both sides when the donkey saw the angel of the lord she pressed close to the wall crushing balaams foot against it so he beat her again then the angel of the lord moved on ahead and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn either to the right or to the left when the donkey saw the angel of the lord she lay down under balaam and he was angry and beat her with his staff then the lord opened the donkeys mouth and she said to balaam what have i done to you to make you beat me these three times balaam answered the donkey you have made a fool of me if i had a sword in my hand i would kill you right now the donkey said to balaam am i not your own donkey which you have always ridden to this day have i been in the habit of doing this to youno he said then the lord opened balaams eyes and he saw the angel of the lord standing in the road with his sword drawn so he bowed low and fell facedown the angel of the lord asked him why have you beaten your donkey these three times i have come here to oppose you because your path is a reckless one before me the donkey saw me and turned away from me these three times if she had not turned away i would certainly have killed you by now but i would have spared her balaam said to the angel of the lord i have sinned i did not realize you were standing in the road to oppose me now if you are displeased i will go back the angel of the lord said to balaam go with the men but speak only what i tell you so balaam went with the princes of balak when balak heard that balaam was coming he went out to meet him at the moabite town on the arnon border at the edge of his territory balak said to balaam did i not send you an urgent summons why didnt you come to me am i really not able to reward you well i have come to you now balaam replied but can i say just anything i must speak only what god puts in my mouth then balaam went with balak to kiriath huzoth balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and gave some to balaam and the princes who were with him the next morning balak took balaam up to bamoth baal and from there he saw part of the people balaam said build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me balak did as balaam said and the two of them offered a bull and a ram on each altar then balaam said to balak stay here beside your offering while i go aside perhaps the lord will come to meet with me whatever he reveals to me i will tell you then he went off to a barren height god met with him and balaam said i have prepared seven altars and on each altar i have offered a bull and a ram the lord put a message in balaams mouth and said go back to balak and give him this message so he went back to him and found him standing beside his offering with all the princes of moab then balaam uttered his oracle balak brought me from aram the king of moab from the eastern mountains come he said curse jacob for me come denounce israel how can i curse those whom god has not cursed how can i denounce those whom the lord has not denounced from the rocky peaks i see them from the heights i view them i see a people who live apart and do not consider themselves one of the nations who can count the dust of jacob or number the fourth part of israel let me die the death of the righteous and may my end be like theirs balak said to balaam what have you done to me i brought you to curse my enemies but you have done nothing but bless them he answered must i not speak what the lord puts in my mouth then balak said to him come with me to another place where you can see them you will see only a part but not all of them and from there curse them for me so he took him to the field of zophim on the top of pisgah and there he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on each altar balaam said to balak stay here beside your offering while i meet with him over there the lord met with balaam and put a message in his mouth and said go back to balak and give him this message so he went to him and found him standing beside his offering with the princes of moab balak asked him what did the lord say then he uttered his oracle arise balak and listen hear me son of zippor god is not a man that he should lie nor a son of man that he should change his mind does he speak and then not act does he promise and not fulfill i have received a command to bless he has blessed and i cannot change it no misfortune is seen in jacob no misery observed in israel the lord their god is with them the shout of the king is among them god brought them out of egypt they have the strength of a wild ox there is no sorcery against jacob no divination against israel it will now be said of jacob and of israel see what god has done the people rise like a lioness they rouse themselves like a lion that does not rest till he devours his prey and drinks the blood of his victims then balak said to balaam neither curse them at all nor bless them at all balaam answered did i not tell you i must do whatever the lord says then balak said to balaam come let me take you to another place perhaps it will please god to let you curse them for me from there and balak took balaam to the top of peor overlooking the wasteland balaam said build me seven altars here and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me balak did as balaam had said and offered a bull and a ram on each altar now when balaam saw that it pleased the lord to bless israel he did not resort to sorcery as at other times but turned his face toward the desert when balaam looked out and saw israel encamped tribe by tribe the spirit of god came upon him and he uttered his oracle the oracle of balaam son of beor the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly the oracle of one who hears the words of god who sees a vision from the almighty who falls prostrate and whose eyes are opened how beautiful are your tents o jacob your dwelling places o israel like valleys they spread out like gardens beside a river like aloes planted by the lord like cedars beside the waters water will flow from their buckets their seed will have abundant water their king will be greater than agag their kingdom will be exalted god brought them out of egypt they have the strength of a wild ox they devour hostile nations and break their bones in pieces with their arrows they pierce them like a lion they crouch and lie down like a lioness who dares to rouse them may those who bless you be blessed and those who curse you be cursed then balaks anger burned against balaam he struck his hands together and said to him i summoned you to curse my enemies but you have blessed them these three times now leave at once and go home i said i would reward you handsomely but the lord has kept you from being rewarded balaam answered balak did i not tell the messengers you sent me even if balak gave me his palace filled with silver and gold i could not do anything of my own accord good or bad to go beyond the command of the lord and i must say only what the lord says now i am going back to my people but come let me warn you of what this people will do to your people in days to come then he uttered his oracle the oracle of balaam son of beor the oracle of one whose eye sees clearly the oracle of one who hears the words of god who has knowledge from the most high who sees a vision from the almighty who falls prostrate and whose eyes are opened i see him but not now i behold him but not near a star will come out of jacob a scepter will rise out of israel he will crush the foreheads of moab the skulls of all the sons of sheth edom will be conquered seir his enemy will be conquered but israel will grow strong a ruler will come out of jacob and destroy the survivors of the city then balaam saw amalek and uttered his oracle amalek was first among the nations but he will come to ruin at last then he saw the kenites and uttered his oracle your dwelling place is secure your nest is set in a rock yet you kenites will be destroyed when asshur takes you captive then he uttered his oracle ah who can live when god does this ships will come from the shores of kittim they will subdue asshur and eber but they too will come to ruin then balaam got up and returned home and balak went his own way while israel was staying in shittim the men began to indulge in sexual immorality with moabite women who invited them to the sacrifices to their gods the people ate and bowed down before these gods so israel joined in worshiping the baal of peor and the lords anger burned against them the lord said to moses take all the leaders of these people kill them and expose them in broad daylight before the lord so that the lords fierce anger may turn away from israel so moses said to israels judges each of you must put to death those of your men who have joined in worshiping the baal of peor then an israelite man brought to his family a midianite woman right before the eyes of moses and the whole assembly of israel while they were weeping at the entrance to the tent of meeting when phinehas son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest saw this he left the assembly took a spear in his hand and followed the israelite into the tent he drove the spear through both of them through the israelite and into the womans body then the plague against the israelites was stopped but those who died in the plague numbered 24000 the lord said to moses phinehas son of eleazar the son of aaron the priest has turned my anger away from the israelites for he was as zealous as i am for my honor among them so that in my zeal i did not put an end to them therefore tell him i am making my covenant of peace with him he and his descendants will have a covenant of a lasting priesthood because he was zealous for the honor of his god and made atonement for the israelites the name of the israelite who was killed with the midianite woman was zimri son of salu the leader of a simeonite family and the name of the midianite woman who was put to death was cozbi daughter of zur a tribal chief of a midianite family the lord said to moses treat the midianites as enemies and kill them because they treated you as enemies when they deceived you in the affair of peor and their sister cozbi the daughter of a midianite leader the woman who was killed when the plague came as a result of peor after the plague the lord said to moses and eleazar son of aaron the priest take a

had no son give us property among our fathers relatives so moses brought their case before the lord and the lord said to him what zelophehads daughters are saying is right you must certainly give them property as an inheritance among their fathers relatives and turn their fathers inheritance over to them say to the israelites if a man dies and leaves no son turn his inheritance over to his daughter if he has no daughter give his inheritance to his brothers if he has no brothers give his inheritance to his fathers brothers if his father had no brothers give his inheritance to the nearest relative

i have given the israelites after you have seen it you too will be gathered to your people as your brother aaron was for when the community rebelled at the waters in the desert of zin both of you disobeyed my command to honor me as holy before their eyes these were the waters of meribah kadesh in the desert of zin moses said to the lord may the lord the god of the spirits of all mankind appoint a man over this community to go out and come in before them one who will lead them out and bring them in so the lords people will not be like sheep without a shepherd so the lord said to moses

takes an oath to obligate himself by a pledge he must not break his word but must do everything he said when a young woman still living in her fathers house makes a vow to the lord or obligates herself by a pledge and her father hears about her vow or pledge but says nothing to her then all her vows and every pledge by which she obligated herself will stand but if her father forbids her when he hears about it none of her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand the lord will release her because her father has forbidden her if she marries after she makes a vow or after her lips utter a rash promise by which she obligates herself and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her then her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand but if her husband forbids her when he hears about it he nullifies the vow that obligates her or the rash promise by which she obligates herself and the lord will release her any vow or obligation taken by a widow or divorced woman will be binding on her if a woman living with her husband makes a vow or obligates herself by a pledge under oath and her husband hears about it but says nothing to her and does not forbid her then all her vows or the pledges by which she obligated herself will stand but if her husband nullifies them when he hears about them then none of the vows or pledges that came from her lips will stand her husband has nullified them and the lord will release her her husband may confirm or nullify any vow she makes or any sworn pledge to deny herself but if her husband says nothing to her about it from day to day then he confirms all her vows or the pledges binding on her he confirms them by saying nothing to her when he hears about them if however he nullifies them some time after he hears about them then he is responsible for her guilt these are the regulations the lord gave moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife and between a father and his young daughter still living in his house the lord said to moses take vengeance on the midianites for the israelites after that you will be gathered to your people so moses said to the people arm some of your men to go to war against the midianites and to carry out the lords vengeance on them send into battle a thousand men from each of the tribes of israel so twelve thousand men armed for battle a thousand from each tribe were supplied from the clans of israel moses sent them into battle a thousand from each tribe along with phinehas son of eleazar the priest who took with him articles from the sanctuary and the trumpets for signaling they fought against midian as the lord commanded moses and killed every man among their victims were evi rekem zur hur and reba the five kings of midian they also killed balaam son of beor with the sword the israelites captured the midianite women and children and took all the midianite herds flocks and goods as plunder they burned all the towns where the midianites had settled as well as all their camps they took all the plunder and spoils including the people and animals and brought the captives spoils and plunder to moses and eleazar the priest and the israelite assembly at their camp on the plains of moab by the jordan across from jericho moses eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp moses was angry with the officers of the army the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds who returned from the battle have you allowed all the women to live he asked them they were the ones who followed balaams advice and were the means of turning the israelites away from the lord in what happened at peor so that a plague struck the lords people now kill all the boys and kill every woman who has slept with a man but save for yourselves every girl who has never slept with a man all of you who have killed anyone or touched anyone who was killed must stay outside the camp seven days on the third and seventh days you must purify yourselves and your captives purify every garment as well as everything made of leather goat hair or wood then eleazar the priest said to the soldiers who had gone into battle this is the requirement of the law that the lord gave moses gold silver bronze iron tin lead and anything else that can withstand fire must be put through the fire and then it will be clean but it must also be purified with the water of cleansing and whatever cannot withstand fire must be put through that water on the seventh day wash your clothes and you will be clean then you may come into the camp the lord said to moses you and eleazar the priest and the family heads of the community are to count all the people and animals that were captured divide the spoils between the soldiers who took part in the battle and the rest of the community from the soldiers who fought in the battle set apart as tribute for the lord one out of every five hundred whether persons cattle donkeys sheep or goats take this tribute from their half share and give it to eleazar the priest as the lords part from the israelites half select one out of every fifty whether persons cattle donkeys sheep goats or other animals give them to the levites who are responsible for the care of the lords tabernacle so moses and eleazar the priest did as the lord commanded moses the plunder remaining from the spoils that the soldiers took was 675000 sheep 72000 cattle 61000 donkeys and 32000 women who had never slept with a man the half share of those who fought in the battle was 337500 sheep of which the tribute for the lord was 675 36000 cattle of which the tribute for the lord was 72 30500 donkeys of which the tribute for the lord was 61 16000 people of which the tribute for the lord was 32 moses gave the tribute to eleazar the priest as the lords part as the lord commanded moses the half belonging to the israelites which moses set apart from that of the fighting men the communitys half was 337500 sheep 36000 cattle 30500 donkeys and 16000 people from the israelites half moses selected one out of every fifty persons and animals as the lord commanded him and gave them to the levites who were responsible for the care of the lords tabernacle then the officers who were over the units of the army the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds went to moses and said to him your servants have counted the soldiers under our command and not one is missing so we have brought as an offering to the lord the gold articles each of us acquired armlets bracelets signet rings earrings and necklaces to make atonement for ourselves before the lord moses and eleazar the priest accepted from them the gold all the crafted articles all the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds that moses and eleazar presented as a gift to the lord weighed 16750 shekels each soldier had taken plunder for himself moses and eleazar the priest accepted the gold from the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds and brought it into the tent of meeting as a memorial for the israelites before the lord the reubenites and gadites who had very large herds and flocks saw that the lands of jazer and gilead were suitable for livestock so they came to moses and eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the community and said ataroth dibon jazer nimrah heshbon elealeh sebam nebo and beon the land the lord subdued before the people of israel are suitable for livestock and your servants have livestock if we have found favor in your eyes they said let this land be given to your servants as our possession do not make us cross the jordan moses said to the gadites and reubenites shall your countrymen go to war while you sit here why do you discourage the israelites from going over into the land the lord has given them this is what your fathers did when i sent them from kadesh barnea to look over the land after they went up to the valley of eshcol and viewed the land they discouraged the israelites from entering the land the lord had given them the lords anger was aroused that day and he swore this oath because they have not followed me wholeheartedly not one of the men twenty years old or more who came up out of egypt will see the land i promised on oath to abraham isaac and jacob not one except caleb son of jephunneh the kenizzite and joshua son of nun for they followed the lord wholeheartedly the lords anger burned against israel and he made them wander in the desert forty years until the whole generation of those who had done evil in his sight was gone and here you are a brood of sinners standing in the place of your fathers and making the lord even more angry with israel if you turn away from following him he will again leave all this people in the desert and you will be the cause of their destruction then they came up to him and said we would like to build pens here for our livestock and cities for our women and children but we are ready to arm ourselves and go ahead of the israelites until we have brought them to their place meanwhile our women and children will live in fortified cities for protection from the inhabitants of the land we will not return to our homes until every israelite has received his inheritance we will not receive any inheritance with them on the other side of the jordan because our inheritance has come to us on the east side of the jordan then moses said to them if you will do this if you will arm yourselves before the lord for battle and if all of you will go armed over the jordan before the lord until he has driven his enemies out before him then when the land is subdued before the lord you may return and be free from your obligation to the lord and to israel and this land will be your possession before the lord but if you fail to do this you will be sinning against the lord and you may be sure that your sin will find you out build cities for your women and children and pens for your flocks but do what you have promised the gadites and reubenites said to moses we your servants will do as our lord commands our children and wives our flocks and herds will remain here in the cities of gilead but your servants every man armed for battle will cross over to fight before the lord just as our lord says then moses gave orders about them to eleazar the priest and joshua son of nun and to the family heads of the israelite tribes he said to them if the gadites and reubenites every man armed for battle cross over the jordan with you before the lord then when the land is subdued before you give them the land of gilead as their possession but if they do not cross over with you armed they must accept their possession with you in canaan the gadites and reubenites answered your servants will do what the lord has said we will cross over before the lord into canaan armed but the property we inherit will be on this side of the jordan then moses gave to the gadites the reubenites and the half tribe of manasseh son of joseph the kingdom of sihon king of the amorites and the kingdom of og king of bashan the whole land with its cities and the territory around them the gadites built up dibon ataroth aroer atroth shophan jazer jogbehah beth nimrah and beth haran as fortified cities and built pens for their flocks and the reubenites rebuilt heshbon elealeh and kiriathaim as well as nebo and baal meon these names were changed and sibmah they gave names to the cities they rebuilt the descendants of makir son of manasseh went to gilead captured it and drove out the amorites who were there so moses gave gilead to the makirites the descendants of manasseh and they settled there jair a descendant of manasseh captured their settlements and called them havvoth jair and nobah captured kenath and its surrounding settlements and called it nobah after himself here are the stages in the journey of the israelites when they came out of egypt by divisions under the leadership of moses and aaron at the lords command moses recorded the stages in their journey this is their journey by stages the israelites set out from rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month the day after the passover they marched out boldly in full view of all the egyptians who were burying all their firstborn whom the lord had struck down among them for the lord

moab by the jordan across from jericho there on the plains of moab they camped along the jordan from beth jeshimoth to abel shittim on the plains of moab by the jordan across from jericho the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them when you cross the jordan into canaan drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you destroy all their carved images and their cast idols and demolish all their high places take possession of the land and settle in it for i have given you the land to possess distribute the land by lot according to your clans to a larger group give a larger inheritance and to a smaller group a smaller one whatever falls to them by lot will be theirs distribute it according to your ancestral tribes but if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land those you allow to remain will become barbs in your eyes and thorns in your sides they will give you trouble in the land where you will live and then i will do to you what i plan to do to them the lord said to moses command the israelites and say to them when you enter canaan the land that will be allotted to you as an inheritance will have these boundaries your southern side will include some of the desert of zin along the border of edom on the east your southern boundary will start from the end of the salt sea cross south of scorpion pass continue on to zin and go south of kadesh barnea then it will go to hazar addar and over to azmon where it will turn join the wadi of egypt and end at the sea your western boundary will be the coast of the great sea this will be your boundary on the west for your northern boundary run a line from the great sea to mount hor and from mount hor to lebo hamath then the boundary will go to zedad continue to ziphron and end at hazar enan this will be your boundary on the north for your eastern boundary run a line from hazar enan to shepham the boundary will go down from shepham to riblah on the east side of ain and continue along the slopes east of the sea of kinnereth then the boundary will go down along the jordan and end at the salt sea this will be your land with its boundaries on every side moses commanded the israelites assign this land by lot as an inheritance the lord has ordered that it be given to the nine and a half tribes because the families of the tribe of reuben the tribe of gad and the half tribe of manasseh have received their inheritance these two and a half tribes have received their inheritance on the east side of the jordan of jericho toward the sunrise the lord said to moses these are the names of the men who are to assign the land for you as an inheritance eleazar the priest and joshua son of nun and appoint one leader from each tribe to help assign the land these are their names caleb son of jephunneh from the tribe of judah shemuel son of ammihud from the tribe of simeon elidad son of kislon from the tribe of benjamin bukki son of jogli the leader from the tribe of dan hanniel son of ephod the leader from the tribe of manasseh son of joseph kemuel son of shiphtan the leader from the tribe of ephraim son of joseph elizaphan son of parnach the leader from the tribe of zebulun paltiel son of azzan the leader from the tribe of issachar ahihud son of shelomi the leader from the tribe of asher pedahel son of ammihud the leader from the tribe of naphtali these are the men the lord commanded to assign the inheritance to the israelites in the land of canaan on the plains of moab by the jordan across from jericho the lord said to moses command the israelites to give the levites towns to live in from the inheritance the israelites will possess and give them pasturelands around the towns then they will have towns to live in and pasturelands for their cattle flocks and all their other livestock the pasturelands around the towns that you give the levites will extend out fifteen hundred feet from the town wall outside the town measure three thousand feet on the east side three thousand on the south side three thousand on the west and three thousand on the north with the town in the center they will have this area as pastureland for the towns six of the towns you give the levites will be cities of refuge to which a person who has killed someone may flee in addition give them forty two other towns in all you must give the levites forty eight towns together with their pasturelands the towns you give the levites from the land the israelites possess are to be given in proportion to the inheritance of each tribe take many towns from a tribe that has many but few from one that has few then the lord said to moses speak to the israelites and say to them when you cross the jordan into canaan select some towns to be your cities of refuge to which a person who has killed someone accidentally may flee they will be places of refuge from the avenger so that a person accused of murder may not die before he stands trial before the assembly these six towns you give will be your cities of refuge give three on this side of the jordan and three in canaan as cities of refuge these six towns will be a place of refuge for israelites aliens and any other people living among them so that anyone who has killed another accidentally can flee there if a man strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies he is a murderer the murderer shall be put to death or if anyone has a stone in his hand that could kill and he strikes someone so that he dies he is a murderer the murderer shall be put to death or if anyone has a wooden object in his hand that could kill and he hits someone so that he dies he is a murderer the murderer shall be put to death the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him he shall put him to death if anyone with malice aforethought shoves another or throws something at him intentionally so that he dies or if in hostility he hits him with his fist so that he dies that person shall be put to death he is a murderer the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death when he meets him but if without hostility someone suddenly shoves another or throws something at him unintentionally or without seeing him drops a stone on him that could kill him and he dies then since he was not his enemy and he did not intend to harm him the assembly must judge between him and the avenger of blood according to these regulations the assembly must protect the one accused of murder from the avenger of blood and send him back to the city of refuge to which he fled he must stay there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the holy oil but if the accused ever goes outside the limits of the city of refuge to which he has fled and the avenger of blood finds him outside the city the avenger of blood may kill the accused without being guilty of murder the accused must stay in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest only after the death of the high priest may he return to his own property these are to be legal requirements for you throughout the generations to come wherever you live anyone who kills a person is to be put to death as a murderer only on the testimony of witnesses but no one is to be put to death on the testimony of only one witness do not accept a ransom for the life of a murderer who deserves to die he must surely be put to death do not accept a ransom for anyone who has fled to a city of refuge and so allow him to go back and live on his own land before the death of the high priest do not pollute the land where you are bloodshed pollutes the land and atonement cannot be made for the land on which blood has been shed except by the blood of the one who shed it do not defile the land where you live and where i dwell for i the lord dwell among the israelites the family heads of the clan of gilead son of makir the son of manasseh who were from the clans of the descendants of joseph came and spoke before moses and the leaders the heads of the israelite families they said when the lord commanded my lord to give the land as an inheritance to the israelites by lot he ordered you to give the inheritance of our brother zelophehad to his daughters now suppose they marry men from other israelite tribes then their inheritance will be taken from our ancestral inheritance and added to that of the tribe they marry into and so part of the inheritance allotted to us will be taken away when the year of jubilee for the israelites comes their inheritance will be added to that of the tribe into which they marry and their property will be taken from the tribal inheritance of our forefathers then at the lords command moses gave this order to the israelites what the tribe of the descendants of joseph is saying is right this is what the lord commands for zelophehads daughters they may marry anyone they please as long as they marry within the tribal clan of their father no inheritance in israel is to pass from tribe to tribe for every israelite shall keep the tribal land inherited from his forefathers every daughter who inherits land in any israelite tribe must marry someone in her fathers tribal clan so that every israelite will possess the inheritance of his fathers no inheritance may pass from tribe to tribe for each israelite tribe is to keep the land it inherits so zelophehads daughters did as the lord commanded moses zelophehads daughters mahlah tirzah hoglah milcah and noah married their cousins on their fathers side they married within the clans of the descendants of manasseh son of joseph and their inheritance remained in their fathers clan and tribe these are the commands and regulations the lord gave through moses to the israelites on the plains of moab by the jordan across from jericho  these are the words moses spoke to all israel in the desert east of the jordan that is in the arabah opposite suph between paran and tophel laban hazeroth and dizahab it takes eleven days to go from horeb to kadesh barnea by the mount seir road in the fortieth year on the first day of the eleventh month moses proclaimed to the israelites all that the lord had commanded him concerning them this was after he had defeated sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon and at edrei had defeated og king of bashan who reigned in ashtaroth east of the jordan in the territory of moab moses began to expound this law saying the lord our god said to us at horeb you have stayed long enough at this mountain break camp and advance into the hill country of the amorites go to all the neighboring peoples in the arabah in the mountains in the western foothills in the negev and along the coast to the land of the canaanites and to lebanon as far as the great river the euphrates see i have given you this land go in and take possession of the land that the lord swore he would give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob and to their descendants after them at that time i said to you you are too heavy a burden for me to carry alone the lord your god has increased your numbers so that today you are as many as the stars in the sky may the lord the god of your fathers increase you a thousand times and bless you as he has promised but how can i bear your problems and your burdens and your disputes all by myself choose some wise understanding and respected men from each of your tribes and i will set them over you you answered me what you propose to do is good so i took the leading men of your tribes wise and respected men and appointed them to have authority over you as commanders of thousands of hundreds of fifties and of tens and as tribal officials and i charged your judges at that time hear the disputes between your brothers and judge fairly whether the case is between brother israelites or between one of them and an alien do not show partiality in judging hear both small and great alike do not be afraid of any man for judgment belongs to god bring me any case too hard for you and i will hear it and at that time i told you everything you were to do then as the lord our god commanded us we set out from horeb and went toward the hill country of the amorites through all that vast and dreadful desert that you have seen and so we reached kadesh barnea then i said to you you have reached the hill country of the amorites which the lord our god is giving us see the lord your god has given you the land go up and take possession of it as the lord the god of your fathers told you do not be afraid do not be discouraged then all of you came to me and said let us send men ahead to spy out the land for us and bring back a report about the route we are to take and the towns we will come to the idea seemed good to me so i selected twelve of you one man from each tribe they left and went up into the hill country and came to the valley of eshcol and explored it taking with them some of the fruit of the land they brought it down to us and reported it is a good land that the lord our god is giving us but you were unwilling to go up you rebelled against the command of the lord your god you grumbled in your tents and said the lord hates us so he brought us out of egypt to deliver us into the hands of the amorites to destroy us where can we go our brothers have made us lose heart they say the people are stronger and taller than we are the cities are large with walls up to the sky we even saw the anakites there then i said to you do not be terrified do not be afraid of them the lord your god who is going before you will fight for you as he did for you in egypt before your very eyes and in the desert there you saw how the lord your god carried you as a father carries his son all the way you went until you reached this place in spite of this you did not trust in the lord your god who went ahead of you on your journey in fire by night and in a cloud by day to search out places for you to camp and to show you the way you should go when the lord heard what you said he was angry and solemnly swore not a man of this evil generation shall see the good land i swore to give your forefathers except caleb son of jephunneh he will see it and i will give him and his descendants the land he set his feet on because he followed the lord wholeheartedly because of you the lord became angry with me also and said you shall not enter it either but your assistant joshua son of nun will enter it encourage him because he will lead israel to inherit it and the little ones that you said would be taken captive your children who do not yet know good from bad they will enter the land i will give it to them and they will take possession of it but as for you turn around and set out toward the desert along the route to the red sea then you replied we have sinned against the lord we will go up and fight as the lord our god commanded us so every one of you put on his weapons thinking it easy to go up into the hill country but the lord said to me tell them do not go up and fight because i will not be with you you will be defeated by your enemies so i told you but you would not listen you rebelled against the lords command and in your arrogance you marched up into the hill country the amorites who lived in those hills came out against you they chased you like a swarm of bees and beat you down from seir all the way to hormah you came back and wept before the lord but he paid no attention to your weeping and turned a deaf ear to you and so you stayed in kadesh many days all the time you spent there then we turned back and set out toward the desert along the route to the red sea as the lord had directed me for a long time we made our way around the hill country of seir then the lord said to me you have made your way around this hill country long enough now turn north give the people these orders you are about to pass through the territory of your brothers the descendants of esau who live in seir they will be afraid of you but be very careful do not provoke them to war for i will not give you any of their land not even enough to put your foot on i have given esau the hill country of seir as his own you are to pay them in silver for the food you eat and the water you drink the lord your god has blessed you in all the work of your hands he has watched over your journey through this vast desert these forty years the lord your god has been with you and you have not lacked anything so we went on past our brothers the descendants of esau who live in seir we turned from the arabah road which comes up from elath and ezion geber and traveled along the desert road of moab then the lord said to me do not harass the moabites or provoke them to war for i will not give you any part of their land i have given ar to the descendants of lot as a possession the emites used to live there a people strong and numerous and as tall as the anakites like the anakites they too were considered rephaites but the moabites called them emites horites used to live in seir but the descendants of esau drove them out they destroyed the horites from before them and settled in their place just as israel did in the land the lord gave them as their possession and the lord said now get up and cross the zered valley so we crossed the valley thirty eight years passed from the time we left kadesh barnea until we crossed the zered valley by then that entire generation of fighting men had perished from the camp as the lord had sworn to them the lords hand was against them until he had completely eliminated them from the camp now when the last of these fighting men among the people had died the lord said to me today you are to pass by the region of moab at ar when you come to the ammonites do not harass them or provoke them to war for i will not give you possession of any land belonging to the ammonites i have given it as a possession to the descendants of lot that too was considered a land of the rephaites who used to live there but the ammonites called them zamzummites they were a people strong and numerous and as tall as the anakites the lord destroyed them from before the ammonites who drove them out and settled in their place the lord had done the same for the descendants of esau who lived in seir when he destroyed the horites from before them they drove them out and have lived in their place to this day and as for the avvites who lived in villages as far as gaza the caphtorites coming out from caphtor destroyed them and settled in their place set out now and cross the arnon gorge see i have given into your hand sihon the amorite king of heshbon and his country begin to take possession of it and engage him in battle this very day i will begin to put the terror and fear of you on all the nations under heaven they will hear reports of you and will tremble and be in anguish because of you from the desert of kedemoth i sent messengers to sihon king of heshbon offering peace and saying let us pass through your country we will stay on the main road we will not turn aside to the right or to the left sell us food to eat and water to drink for their price in silver only let us pass through on foot as the descendants of esau who live in seir and the moabites who live in ar did for us until we cross the jordan into the land the lord our god is giving us but sihon king of heshbon refused to let us pass through for the lord your god had made his spirit stubborn and his heart obstinate in order to give him into your hands as he has now done the lord said to me see i have begun to deliver sihon and his country over to you now begin to conquer and possess his land when sihon and all his army came out to meet us in battle at jahaz the lord our god delivered him over to us and we struck him down together with his sons and his whole army at that time we took all his towns and completely destroyed them men women and children we left no survivors but the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves from aroer on the rim of the arnon gorge and from the town in the gorge even as far as gilead not one town was too strong for us the lord our god gave us all of them but in accordance with the command of the lord our god you did not encroach on any of the land of the ammonites neither the land along the course of the jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills next we turned and went up along the road toward bashan and og king of bashan with his whole army marched out to meet us in battle at edrei the lord said to me do not be afraid of him for i have handed him over to you with his whole army and his land do to him what you did to sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon so the lord our god also gave into our hands og king of bashan and all his army we struck them down leaving no survivors at that time we took all his cities there was not one of the sixty cities that we did not take from them the whole region of argob ogs kingdom in bashan all these cities were fortified with high walls and with gates and bars and there were also a great many unwalled villages we completely destroyed them as we had done with sihon king of heshbon destroying every city men women and children but all the livestock and the plunder from their cities we carried off for ourselves so at that time we took from these two kings of the amorites the territory east of the jordan from the arnon gorge as far as mount hermon hermon is called sirion by the sidonians the amorites call it senir we took all the towns on the plateau and all gilead and all bashan as far as salecah and edrei towns of ogs kingdom in bashan only og king of bashan was left of the remnant of the rephaites his bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide it is still in rabbah of the ammonites of the land that we took over at that time i gave the reubenites and the gadites the territory north of aroer by the arnon gorge including half the hill country of gilead together with its towns the rest of gilead and also all of bashan the kingdom of og i gave to the half tribe of manasseh the whole region of argob in bashan used to be known as a land of the rephaites jair a descendant of manasseh took the whole region of argob as far as the border of the geshurites and the maacathites it was named after him so that to this day bashan is called havvoth jair  and i gave gilead to makir but to the reubenites and the gadites i gave the territory extending from gilead down to the arnon gorge the middle of the gorge being the border and out to the jabbok river which is the border of the ammonites its western border was the jordan in the arabah from kinnereth to the sea of the arabah the salt sea  below the slopes of pisgah i commanded you at that time the lord your god has given you this land to take possession of it but all your able bodied men armed for battle must cross over ahead of your brother israelites however your wives your children and your livestock i know you have much livestock may stay in the towns i have given you until the lord gives rest to your brothers as he has to you and they too have taken over the land that the lord your god is giving them across the jordan after that each of you may go back to the possession i have given you at that time i commanded joshua you have seen with your own eyes all that the lord your god has done to these two kings the lord will do the same to all the kingdoms over there where you are going do not be afraid of them the lord your god himself will fight for you at that time i pleaded with the lord o sovereign lord you have begun to show to your servant your greatness and your strong hand for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you do let me go over and see the good land beyond the jordan that fine hill country and lebanon but because of you the lord was angry with me and would not listen to me that is enough the lord said do not speak to me anymore about this matter go up to the top of pisgah and look west and north and south and east look at the land with your own eyes since you are not going to cross this jordan but commission joshua and encourage and strengthen him for he will lead this people across and will cause them to inherit the land that you will see so we stayed in the valley near beth peor hear now o israel the decrees and laws i am about to teach you follow them so that you may live and may go in and take possession of the land that the lord the god of your fathers is giving you do not add to what i command you and do not subtract from it but keep the commands of the lord your god that i give you you saw with your own eyes what the lord did at baal peor the lord your god destroyed from among you everyone who followed the baal of peor but all of you who held fast to the lord your god are still alive today see i have taught you decrees and laws as the lord my god commanded me so that you may follow them in the land you are entering to take possession of it observe them carefully for this will show your wisdom and understanding to the nations who will hear about all these decrees and say surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people what other nation is so great as to have their gods near them the way the lord our god is near us whenever we pray to him and what other nation is so great as to have such righteous decrees and laws as this body of laws i am setting before you today only be careful and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things your eyes have seen or let them slip from your heart as long as you live teach them to your children and to their children after them remember the day you stood before the lord your god at horeb when he said to me assemble the people before me to hear my words so that they may learn to revere me as long as they live in the land and may teach them to their children you came near and stood at the foot of the mountain while it blazed with fire to the very heavens with black clouds and deep darkness then the lord spoke to you out of the fire you heard the sound of words but saw no form there was only a voice he declared to you his covenant the ten commandments which he commanded you to follow and then wrote them on two stone tablets and the lord directed me at that time to teach you the decrees and laws you are to follow in the land that you are crossing the jordan to possess you saw no form of any kind the day the lord spoke to you at horeb out of the fire therefore watch yourselves very carefully so that you do not become corrupt and make for yourselves an idol an image of any shape whether formed like a man or a woman or like any animal on earth or any bird that flies in the air or like any creature that moves along the ground or any fish in the waters below and when you look up to the sky and see the sun the moon and the stars all the heavenly array do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the lord your god has apportioned to all the nations under heaven but as for you the lord took you and brought you out of the iron smelting furnace out of egypt to be the people of his inheritance as you now are the lord was angry with me because of you and he solemnly swore that i would not cross the jordan and enter the good land the lord your god is giving you as your inheritance i will die in this land i will not cross the jordan but you are about to cross over and take possession of that good land be careful not to forget the covenant of the lord your god that he made with you do not make for yourselves an idol in the form of anything the lord your god has forbidden for the lord your god is a consuming fire a jealous god after you have had children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time if you then become corrupt and make any kind of idol doing evil in the eyes of the lord your god and provoking him to anger i call heaven and earth as witnesses against you this day that you will quickly perish from the land that you are crossing the jordan to possess you will not live there long but will certainly be destroyed the lord will scatter you among the peoples and only a few of you will survive among the nations to which the lord will drive you there you will worship man made gods of wood and stone which cannot see or hear or eat or smell but if from there you seek the lord your god you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul when you are in distress and all these things have happened to you then in later days you will return to the lord your god and obey him for the lord your god is a merciful god he will not abandon or destroy you or forget the covenant with your forefathers which he confirmed to them by oath ask now about the former days long before your time from the day god created man on the earth ask from one end of the heavens to the other has anything so great as this ever happened or has anything like it ever been heard of has any other people heard the voice of god speaking out of fire as you have and lived has any god ever tried to take for himself one nation out of another nation by testings by miraculous signs and wonders by war by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm or by great and awesome deeds like all the things the lord your god did for you in egypt before your very eyes you were shown these things so that you might know that the lord is god besides him there is no other from heaven he made you hear his voice to discipline you on earth he showed you his great fire and you heard his words from out of the fire because he loved your forefathers and chose their descendants after them he brought you out of egypt by his presence and his great strength to drive out before you nations greater and stronger than you and to bring you into their land to give it to you for your inheritance as it is today acknowledge and take to heart this day that the lord is god in heaven above and on the earth below there is no other keep his decrees and commands which i am giving you today so that it may go well with you and your children after you and that you may live long in the land the lord your god gives you for all time then moses set aside three cities east of the jordan to which anyone who had killed a person could flee if he had unintentionally killed his neighbor without malice aforethought he could flee into one of these cities and save his life the cities were these bezer in the desert plateau for the reubenites ramoth in gilead for the gadites and golan in bashan for the manassites this is the law moses set before the israelites these are the stipulations decrees and laws moses gave them when they came out of egypt and were in the valley near beth peor east of the jordan in the land of sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon and was defeated by moses and the israelites as they came out of egypt they took possession of his land and the land of og king of bashan the two amorite kings east of the jordan this land extended from aroer on the rim of the arnon gorge to mount siyon that is hermon and included all the arabah east of the jordan as far as the sea of the arabah below the slopes of pisgah moses summoned all israel and said hear o israel the decrees and laws i declare in your hearing today learn them and be sure to follow them the lord our god made a covenant with us at horeb it was not with our fathers that the lord made this covenant but with us with all of us who are alive here today the lord spoke to you face to face out of the fire on the mountain at that time i stood between the lord and you to declare to you the word of the lord because you were afraid of the fire and did not go up the mountain and he said i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt out of the land of slavery you shall have no other gods before me you shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below you shall not bow down to them or worship them for i the lord your god am a jealous god punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments you shall not misuse the name of the lord your god for the lord will not hold anyone guiltless who misuses his name observe the sabbath day by keeping it holy as the lord your god has commanded you six days you shall labor and do all your work but the seventh day is a sabbath to the lord your god on it you shall not do any work neither you nor your son or daughter nor your manservant or maidservant nor your ox your donkey or any of your animals nor the alien within your gates so that your manservant and maidservant may rest as you do remember that you were slaves in egypt and that the lord your god brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm therefore the lord your god has commanded you to observe the sabbath day honor your father and your mother as the lord your god has commanded you so that you may live long and that it may go well with you in the land the lord your god is giving you you shall not murder you shall not commit adultery you shall not steal you shall not give false testimony against your neighbor you shall not covet your neighbors wife you shall not set your desire on your neighbors house or land his manservant or maidservant his ox or donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor these are the commandments the lord proclaimed in a loud voice to your whole assembly there on the mountain from out of the fire the cloud and the deep darkness and he added nothing more then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me when you heard the voice out of the darkness while the mountain was ablaze with fire all the leading men of your tribes and your elders came to me and you said the lord our god has shown us his glory and his majesty and we have heard his voice from the fire today we have seen that a man can live even if god speaks with him but now why should we die this great fire will consume us and we will die if we hear the voice of the lord our god any longer for what mortal man has ever heard the voice of the living god speaking out of fire as we have and survived go near and listen to all that the lord our god says then tell us whatever the lord our god tells you we will listen and obey the lord heard you when you spoke to me and the lord said to me i have heard what this people said to you everything they said was good oh that their hearts would be inclined to fear me and keep all my commands always so that it might go well with them and their children forever go tell them to return to their tents but you stay here with me so that i may give you all the commands decrees and laws you are to teach them to follow in the land i am giving them to possess so be careful to do what the lord your god has commanded you do not turn aside to the right or to the left walk in all the way that the lord your god has commanded you so that you may live and prosper and prolong your days in the land that you will possess these are the commands decrees and laws the lord your god directed me to teach you to observe in the land that you are crossing the jordan to possess so that you your children and their children after them may fear the lord your god as long as you live by keeping all his decrees and commands that i give you and so that you may enjoy long life hear o israel and be careful to obey so that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly in a land flowing with milk and honey just as the lord the god of your fathers promised you hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength these commandments that i give you today are to be upon your hearts impress them on your children talk about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates when the lord your god brings you into the land he swore to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob to give you a land with large flourishing cities you did not build houses filled with all kinds of good things you did not provide wells you did not dig and vineyards and olive groves you did not plant then when you eat and are satisfied be careful that you do not forget the lord who brought you out of egypt out of the land of slavery fear the lord your god serve him only and take your oaths in his name do not follow other gods the gods of the peoples around you for the lord your god who is among you is a jealous god and his anger will burn against you and he will destroy you from the face of the land do not test the lord your god as you did at massah be sure to keep the commands of the lord your god and the stipulations and decrees he has given you do what is right and good in the lords sight so that it may go well with you and you may go in and take over the good land that the lord promised on oath to your forefathers thrusting out all your enemies before you as the lord said in the future when your son asks you what is the meaning of the stipulations decrees and laws the lord our god has commanded you tell him we were slaves of pharaoh in egypt but the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand before our eyes the lord sent miraculous signs and wonders great and terrible upon egypt and pharaoh and his whole household but he brought us out from there to bring us in and give us the land that he promised on oath to our forefathers the lord commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear the lord our god so that we might always prosper and be kept alive as is the case today and if we are careful to obey all this law before the lord our god as he has commanded us that will be our righteousness when the lord your god brings you into the land you are entering to possess and drives out before you many nations the hittites girgashites amorites canaanites perizzites hivites and jebusites seven nations larger and stronger than you and when the lord your god has delivered them over to you and you have defeated them then you must destroy them totally make no treaty with them and show them no mercy do not intermarry with them do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons for they will turn your sons away from following me to serve other gods and the lords anger will burn against you and will quickly destroy you this is what you are to do to them break down their altars smash their sacred stones cut down their asherah poles and burn their idols in the fire for you are a people holy to the lord your god the lord your god has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be his people his treasured possession the lord did not set his affection on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other peoples for you were the fewest of all peoples but it was because the lord loved you and kept the oath he swore to your forefathers that he brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you from the land of slavery from the power of pharaoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord your god is god he is the faithful god keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands but those who hate him he will repay to their face by destruction he will not be slow to repay to their face those who hate him therefore take care to follow the commands decrees and laws i give you today if you pay attention to these laws and are careful to follow them then the lord your god will keep his covenant of love with you as he swore to your forefathers he will love you and bless you and increase your numbers he will bless the fruit of your womb the crops of your land your grain new wine and oil the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks in the land that he swore to your forefathers to give you you will be blessed more than any other people none of your men or women will be childless nor any of your livestock without young the lord will keep you free from every disease he will not inflict on you the horrible diseases you knew in egypt but he will inflict them on all who hate you you must destroy all the peoples the lord your god gives over to you do not look on them with pity and do not serve their gods for that will be a snare to you you may say to yourselves these nations are stronger than we are how can we drive them out but do not be afraid of them remember well what the lord your god did to pharaoh and to all egypt you saw with your own eyes the great trials the miraculous signs and wonders the mighty hand and outstretched arm with which the lord your god brought you out the lord your god will do the same to all the peoples you now fear moreover the lord your god will send the hornet among them until even the survivors who hide from you have perished do not be terrified by them for the lord your god who is among you is a great and awesome god the lord your god will drive out those nations before you little by little you will not be allowed to eliminate them all at once or the wild animals will multiply around you but the lord your god will deliver them over to you throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed he will give their kings into your hand and you will wipe out their names from under heaven no one will be able to stand up against you you will destroy them the images of their gods you are to burn in the fire do not covet the silver and gold on them and do not take it for yourselves or you will be ensnared by it for it is detestable to the lord your god do not bring a detestable thing into your house or you like it will be set apart for destruction utterly abhor and detest it for it is set apart for destruction be careful to follow every command i am giving you today so that you may live and increase and may enter and possess the land that the lord promised on oath to your forefathers remember how the lord your god led you all the way in the desert these forty years to humble you and to test you in order to know what was in your heart whether or not you would keep his commands he humbled you causing you to hunger and then feeding you with manna which neither you nor your fathers had known to teach you that man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of the lord your clothes did not wear out and your feet did not swell during these forty years know then in your heart that as a man disciplines his son so the lord your god disciplines you observe the commands of the lord your god walking in his ways and revering him for the lord your god is bringing you into a good land a land with streams and pools of water with springs flowing in the valleys and hills a land with wheat and barley vines and fig trees pomegranates olive oil and honey a land where bread will not be scarce and you will lack nothing a land where the rocks are iron and you can dig copper out of the hills when you have eaten and are satisfied praise the lord your god for the good land he has given you be careful that you do not forget the lord your god failing to observe his commands his laws and his decrees that i am giving you this day otherwise when you eat and are satisfied when you build fine houses and settle down and when your herds and flocks grow large and your silver and gold increase and all you have is multiplied then your heart will become proud and you will forget the lord your god who brought you out of egypt out of the land of slavery he led you through the vast and dreadful desert that thirsty and waterless land with its venomous snakes and scorpions he brought you water out of hard rock he gave you manna to eat in the desert something your fathers had never known to humble and to test you so that in the end it might go well with you you may say to yourself my power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me but remember the lord your god for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth and so confirms his covenant which he swore to your forefathers as it is today if you ever forget the lord your god and follow other gods and worship and bow down to them i testify against you today that you will surely be destroyed like the nations the lord destroyed before you so you will be destroyed for not obeying the lord your god hear o israel you are now about to cross the jordan to go in and dispossess nations greater and stronger than you with large cities that have walls up to the sky the people are strong and tall anakites you know about them and have heard it said who can stand up against the anakites but be assured today that the lord your god is the one who goes across ahead of you like a devouring fire he will destroy them he will subdue them before you and you will drive them out and annihilate them quickly as the lord has promised you after the lord your god has driven them out before you do not say to yourself the lord has brought me here to take possession of this land because of my righteousness no it is on account of the wickedness of these nations that the lord is going to drive them out before you it is not because of your righteousness or your integrity that you are going in to take possession of their land but on account of the wickedness of these nations the lord your god will drive them out before you to accomplish what he swore to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob understand then that it is not because of your righteousness that the lord your god is giving you this good land to possess for you are a stiff necked people remember this and never forget how you provoked the lord your god to anger in the desert from the day you left egypt until you arrived here you have been rebellious against the lord at horeb you aroused the lords wrath so that he was angry enough to destroy you when i went up on the mountain to receive the tablets of stone the tablets of the covenant that the lord had made with you i stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights i ate no bread and drank no water the lord gave me two stone tablets inscribed by the finger of god on them were all the commandments the lord proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly at the end of the forty days and forty nights the lord gave me the two stone tablets the tablets of the covenant then the lord told me go down from here at once because your people whom you brought out of egypt have become corrupt they have turned away quickly from what i commanded them and have made a cast idol for themselves and the lord said to me i have seen this people and they are a stiff necked people indeed let me alone so that i may destroy them and blot out their name from under heaven and i will make you into a nation stronger and more numerous than they so i turned and went down from the mountain while it was ablaze with fire and the two tablets of the covenant were in my hands when i looked i saw that you had sinned against the lord your god you had made for yourselves an idol cast in the shape of a calf you had turned aside quickly from the way that the lord had commanded you so i took the two tablets and threw them out of my hands breaking them to pieces before your eyes then once again i fell prostrate before the lord for forty days and forty nights i ate no bread and drank no water because of all the sin you had committed doing what was evil in the lords sight and so provoking him to anger i feared the anger and wrath of the lord for he was angry enough with you to destroy you but again the lord listened to me and the lord was angry enough with aaron to destroy him but at that time i prayed for aaron too also i took that sinful thing of yours the calf you had made and burned it in the fire then i crushed it and ground it to powder as fine as dust and threw the dust into a stream that flowed down the mountain you also made the lord angry at taberah at massah and at kibroth hattaavah and when the lord sent you out from kadesh barnea he said go up and take possession of the land i have given you but you rebelled against the command of the lord your god you did not trust him or obey him you have been rebellious against the lord ever since i have known you i lay prostrate before the lord those forty days and forty nights because the lord had said he would destroy you i prayed to the lord and said o sovereign lord do not destroy your people your own inheritance that you redeemed by your great power and brought out of egypt with a mighty hand remember your servants abraham isaac and jacob overlook the stubbornness of this people their wickedness and their sin otherwise the country from which you brought us will say because the lord was not able to take them into the land he had promised them and because he hated them he brought them out to put them to death in the desert but they are your people your inheritance that you brought out by your great power and your outstretched arm at that time the lord said to me chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones and come up to me on the mountain also make a wooden chest i will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you broke then you are to put them in the chest so i made the ark out of acacia wood and chiseled out two stone tablets like the first ones and i went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hands the lord wrote on these tablets what he had written before the ten commandments he had proclaimed to you on the mountain out of the fire on the day of the assembly and the lord gave them to me then i came back down the mountain and put the tablets in the ark i had made as the lord commanded me and they are there now the israelites traveled from the wells of the jaakanites to moserah there aaron died and was buried and eleazar his son succeeded him as priest from there they traveled to gudgodah and on to jotbathah a land with streams of water at that time the lord set apart the tribe of levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the lord to stand before the lord to minister and to pronounce blessings in his name as they still do today that is why the levites have no share or inheritance among their brothers the lord is their inheritance as the lord your god told them now i had stayed on the mountain forty days and nights as i did the first time and the lord listened to me at this time also it was not his will to destroy you go the lord said to me and lead the people on their way so that they may enter and possess the land that i swore to their fathers to give them and now o israel what does the lord your god ask of you but to fear the lord your god to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and to observe the lords commands and decrees that i am giving you today for your own good to the lord your god belong the heavens even the highest heavens the earth and everything in it yet the lord set his affection on your forefathers and loved them and he chose you their descendants above all the nations as it is today circumcise your hearts therefore and do not be stiff necked any longer for the lord your god is god of gods and lord of lords the great god mighty and awesome who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes he defends the cause of the fatherless and the widow and loves the alien giving him food and clothing and you are to love those who are aliens for you yourselves were aliens in egypt fear the lord your god and serve him hold fast to him and take your oaths in his name he is your praise he is your god who performed for you those great and awesome wonders you saw with your own eyes your forefathers who went down into egypt were seventy in all and now the lord your god has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky love the lord your god and keep his requirements his decrees his laws and his commands always remember today that your children were not the ones who saw and experienced the discipline of the lord your god his majesty his mighty hand his outstretched arm the signs he performed and the things he did in the heart of egypt both to pharaoh king of egypt and to his whole country what he did to the egyptian army to its horses and chariots how he overwhelmed them with the waters of the red sea as they were pursuing you and how the lord brought lasting ruin on them it was not your children who saw what he did for you in the desert until you arrived at this place and what he did to dathan and abiram sons of eliab the reubenite when the earth opened its mouth right in the middle of all israel and swallowed them up with their households their tents and every living thing that belonged to them but it was your own eyes that saw all these great things the lord has done observe therefore all the commands i am giving you today so that you may have the strength to go in and take over the land that you are crossing the jordan to possess and so that you may live long in the land that the lord swore to your forefathers to give to them and their descendants a land flowing with milk and honey the land you are entering to take over is not like the land of egypt from which you have come where you planted your seed and irrigated it by foot as in a vegetable garden but the land you are crossing the jordan to take possession of is a land of mountains and valleys that drinks rain from heaven it is a land the lord your god cares for the eyes of the lord your god are continually on it from the beginning of the year to its end so if you faithfully obey the commands i am giving you today to love the lord your god and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul then i will send rain on your land in its season both autumn and spring rains so that you may gather in your grain new wine and oil i will provide grass in the fields for your cattle and you will eat and be satisfied be careful or you will be enticed to turn away and worship other gods and bow down to them then the lords anger will burn against you and he will shut the heavens so that it will not rain and the ground will yield no produce and you will soon perish from the good land the lord is giving you fix these words of mine in your hearts and minds tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads teach them to your children talking about them when you sit at home and when you walk along the road when you lie down and when you get up write them on the doorframes of your houses and on your gates so that your days and the days of your children may be many in the land that the lord swore to give your forefathers as many as the days that the heavens are above the earth if you carefully observe all these commands i am giving you to follow to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways and to hold fast to him then the lord will drive out all these nations before you and you will dispossess nations larger and stronger than you every place where you set your foot will be yours your territory

giving you when you have taken it over and are living there be sure that you obey all the decrees and laws i am setting before you today these are the decrees and laws you must be careful to follow in the land that the lord the god of your fathers has given you to possess as long as you live in the land destroy completely all the places on the high mountains and on the hills and under every spreading tree where the nations you are dispossessing worship their gods break down their altars smash their sacred stones and burn their asherah poles in the fire cut down the idols of their gods and wipe out their names from those places you must not worship the lord your god in their way but you are to seek the place the lord your god will choose from among all your tribes to put his name there for his dwelling to that place you must go there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and special gifts what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings and the firstborn of your herds and flocks there in the presence of the lord your god you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to because the lord your god has blessed you you are not to do as we do here today everyone as he sees fit since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the lord your god is giving you but you will cross the jordan and settle in the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety then to the place the lord your god will choose as a dwelling for his name there you are to bring everything i command you your burnt offerings and sacrifices your tithes and special gifts and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the lord and there rejoice before the lord your god you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please offer them only at the place the lord will choose in one of your tribes and there observe everything i command you nevertheless you may slaughter your animals in any of your towns and eat as much of the meat as you want as if it were gazelle or deer according to the blessing the lord your god gives you both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it but you must not eat the blood pour it out on the ground like water you must not eat in your own towns the tithe of your grain and new wine and oil or the firstborn of your herds and flocks or whatever you have vowed to give or your freewill offerings or special gifts instead you are to eat them in the presence of the lord your god at the place the lord your god will choose you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the levites from your towns and you are to rejoice before the lord your god in everything you put your hand to be careful not to neglect the levites as long as you live in your land when the lord your god has enlarged your territory as he promised you and you crave meat and say i would like some meat then you may eat as much of it as you want if the place where the lord your god chooses to put his name is too far away from you you may slaughter animals from the herds and flocks the lord has given you as i have commanded you and in your own towns you may eat as much of them as you want eat them as you would gazelle or deer both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat but be sure you do not eat the blood because the blood is the life and you must not eat the life with the meat you must not eat the blood pour it out on the ground like water do not eat it so that it may go well with you and your children after you because you will be doing what is right in the eyes of the lord but take your consecrated things and whatever you have vowed to give and go to the place the lord will choose present your burnt offerings on the altar of the lord your god both the meat and the blood the blood of your sacrifices must be poured beside the altar of the lord your god but you may eat the meat be careful to obey all these regulations i am giving you so that it may always go well with you and your children after you because you will be doing what is good and right in the eyes of the lord your god the lord your god will cut off before you the nations you are about to invade and dispossess but when you have driven them out and settled in their land and after they have been destroyed before you be careful not to be ensnared by inquiring about their gods saying how do these nations serve their gods we will do the same you must not worship the lord your god in their way because in worshiping their gods they do all kinds of detestable things the lord hates they even burn their sons and daughters in the fire as sacrifices to their gods see that you do all i command you do not add to it or take away from it if a prophet or one who foretells by dreams appears among you and announces to you a miraculous sign or wonder and if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place and he says let us follow other gods gods you have not known and let us worship them you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer the lord your god is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul it is the lord your god you must follow and him you must revere keep his commands and obey him serve him and hold fast to him that prophet or dreamer must be put to death because he preached rebellion against the lord your god who brought you out of egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery he has tried to turn you from the way the lord your god commanded you to follow you must purge the evil from among you if your very own brother or your son or daughter or the wife you love or your closest friend secretly entices you saying let us go and worship other gods gods that neither you nor your fathers have known gods of the peoples around you whether near or far from one end of the land to the other do not yield to him or listen to him show him no pity do not spare him or shield him you must certainly put him to death your hand must be the first in putting him to death and then the hands of all the people stone him to death because he tried to turn you away from the lord your god who brought you out of egypt out of the land of slavery then all israel will hear and be afraid and no one among you will do such an evil thing again if you hear it said about one of the towns the lord your god is giving you to live in that wicked men have arisen among you and have led the people of their town astray saying let us go and worship other gods gods you have not known then you must inquire probe and investigate it thoroughly and if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done among you you must certainly put to the sword all who live in that town destroy it completely both its people and its livestock gather all the plunder of the town into the middle of the public square and completely burn the town and all its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the lord your god it is to remain a ruin forever never to be rebuilt none of those condemned things shall be found in your hands so that the lord will turn from his fierce anger he will show you mercy have compassion on you and increase your numbers as he promised on oath to your forefathers because you obey the lord your god keeping all his commands that i am giving you today and doing what is right in his eyes you are the children of the lord your god do not cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for the dead for you are a people holy to the lord your god out of all the peoples on the face of the earth the lord has chosen you to be his treasured possession do not eat any detestable thing these are the animals you may eat the ox the sheep the goat the deer the gazelle the roe deer the wild goat the ibex the antelope and the mountain sheep you may eat any animal that has a split hoof divided in two and that chews the cud however of those that chew the cud or that have a split hoof completely divided you may not eat the camel the rabbit or the coney although they chew the cud they do not have a split hoof they are ceremonially unclean for you the pig is also unclean although it has a split hoof it does not chew the cud you are not to eat their meat or touch their carcasses of all the creatures living in the water you may eat any that has fins and scales but anything that does not have fins and scales you may not eat for you it is unclean you may eat any clean bird but these you may not eat the eagle the vulture the black vulture the red kite the black kite any kind of falcon any kind of raven the horned owl the screech owl the gull any kind of hawk the little owl the great owl the white owl the desert owl the osprey the cormorant the stork any kind of heron the hoopoe and the bat all flying insects that swarm are unclean to you do not eat them but any winged creature that is clean you may eat do not eat anything you find already dead you may give it to an alien living in any of your towns and he may eat it or you may sell it to a foreigner but you are a people holy to the lord your god do not cook a young goat in its mothers milk be sure to set aside a tenth of all that your fields produce each year eat the tithe of your grain new wine and oil and the firstborn of your herds and flocks in the presence of the lord your god at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his name so that you may learn to revere the lord your god always but if that place is too distant and you have been blessed by the lord your god and cannot carry your tithe because the place where the lord will choose to put his name is so far away then exchange your tithe for silver and take the silver with you and go to the place the lord your god will choose use the silver to buy whatever you like cattle sheep wine or other fermented drink or anything you wish then you and your household shall eat there in the presence of the lord your god and rejoice and do not neglect the levites living in your towns for they have no allotment or inheritance of their own at the end of every three years bring all the tithes of that years produce and store it in your towns so that the levites who have no allotment or inheritance of their own and the aliens the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns may come and eat and be satisfied and so that the lord your god may bless you in all the work of your hands at the end of every seven years you must cancel debts this is how it is to be done every creditor shall cancel the loan he has made to his fellow israelite he shall not require payment from his fellow israelite or brother because the lords time for canceling debts has been proclaimed you may require payment from a foreigner but you must cancel any debt your brother owes you however there should be no poor among you for in the land the lord your god is giving you to possess as your inheritance he will richly bless you if only you fully obey the lord your god and are careful to follow all these commands i am giving you today for the lord your god will bless you as he has promised and you will lend to many nations but will borrow from none you will rule over many nations but none will rule over you if there is a poor man among your brothers in any of the towns of the land that the lord your god is giving you do not be hardhearted or tightfisted toward your poor brother rather be openhanded and freely lend him whatever he needs be careful not to harbor this wicked thought the seventh year the year for canceling debts is near so that you do not show ill will toward your needy brother and give him nothing he may then appeal to the lord against you and you will be found guilty of sin give generously to him and do so without a grudging heart then because of this the lord your god will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to there will always be poor people in the land therefore i command you to be openhanded toward your brothers and toward the poor and needy in your land if a fellow hebrew a man or a woman sells himself to you and serves you six years in the seventh year you must let him go free and when you release him do not send him away empty handed supply him liberally from your flock your threshing floor and your winepress give to him as the lord your god has blessed you remember that you were slaves in egypt and the lord your god redeemed you that is why i give you this command today but if your servant says to you i do not want to leave you because he loves you and your family and is well off with you then take an awl and push it through his ear lobe into the door and he will become your servant for life do the same for your maidservant do not consider it a hardship to set your servant free because his service to you these six years has been worth twice as much as that of a hired hand and the lord your god will bless you in everything you do set apart for the lord your god every firstborn male of your herds and flocks do not put the firstborn of your oxen to work and do not shear the firstborn of your sheep each year you and your family are to eat them in the presence of the lord your god at the place he will choose if an animal has a defect is lame or blind or has any serious flaw you must not sacrifice it to the lord your god you are to eat it in your own towns both the ceremonially unclean and the clean may eat it as if it were gazelle or deer but you must not eat the blood pour it out on the ground like water observe the month of abib and celebrate the passover of the lord your god because in the month of abib he brought you out of egypt by night sacrifice as the passover to the lord your god an animal from your flock or herd at the place the lord will choose as a dwelling for his name do not eat it with bread made with yeast but for seven days eat unleavened bread the bread of affliction because you left egypt in haste so that all the days of your life you may remember the time of your departure from egypt let no yeast be found in your possession in all your land for seven days do not let any of the meat you sacrifice on the evening of the first day remain until morning you must not sacrifice the passover in any town the lord your god gives you except in the place he will choose as a dwelling for his name there you must sacrifice the passover in the evening when the sun goes down on the anniversary of your departure from egypt roast it and eat it at the place the lord your god will choose then in the morning return to your tents for six days eat unleavened bread and on the seventh day hold an assembly to the lord your god and do no work count off seven weeks from the time you begin to put the sickle to the standing grain then celebrate the feast of weeks to the lord your god by giving a freewill offering in proportion to the blessings the lord your god has given you and rejoice before the lord your god at the place he will choose as a dwelling for his name you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants the levites in your towns and the aliens the fatherless and the widows living among you remember that you were slaves in egypt and follow carefully these decrees celebrate the feast of tabernacles for seven days after you have gathered the produce of your threshing floor and your winepress be joyful at your feast you your sons and daughters your menservants and maidservants and the levites the aliens the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns for seven days celebrate the feast to the lord your god at the place the lord will choose for the lord your god will bless you in all your harvest and in all the work of your hands and your joy will be complete three times a year all your men must appear before the lord your god at the place he will choose at the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles no man should appear before the lord empty handed each of you must bring a gift in proportion to the way the lord your god has blessed you appoint judges and officials for each of your tribes in every town the lord your god is giving you and they shall judge the people fairly do not pervert justice or show partiality do not accept a bribe for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous follow justice and justice alone so that you may live and possess the land the lord your god is giving you do not set up any wooden asherah pole beside the altar you build to the lord your god and do not erect a sacred stone for these the lord your god hates do not sacrifice to the lord your god an ox or a sheep that has any defect or flaw in it for that would be detestable to him if a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the lord gives you is found doing evil in the eyes of the lord your god in violation of his covenant and contrary to my command has worshiped other gods bowing down to them or to the sun or the moon or the stars of the sky and this has been brought to your attention then you must investigate it thoroughly if it is true and it has been proved that this detestable thing has been done in israel take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your city gate and stone that person to death on the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of only one witness the hands of the witnesses must be the first in putting him to death and then the hands of all the people you must purge the evil from among you if cases come before your courts that are too difficult for you to judge whether bloodshed lawsuits or assaults take them to the place the lord your god will choose go to the priests who are levites and to the judge who is in office at that time inquire of them and they will give you the verdict you must act according to the decisions they give you at the place the lord will choose be careful to do everything they direct you to do act according to the law they teach you and the decisions they give you do not turn aside from what they tell you to the right or to the left the man who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest who stands ministering there to the lord your god must be put to death you must purge the evil from israel all the people will hear and be afraid and will not be contemptuous again when you enter the land the lord your god is giving you and have taken possession of it and settled in it and you say let us set a king over us like all the nations around us be sure to appoint over you the king the lord your god chooses he must be from among your own brothers do not place a foreigner over you one who is not a brother israelite the king moreover must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to egypt to get more of them for the lord has told you you are not to go back that way again he must not take many wives or his heart will be led astray he must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold when he takes the throne of his kingdom he is to write for himself on a scroll a copy of this law taken from that of the priests who are levites it is to be with him and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the lord his god and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees and not consider himself better than his brothers and turn from the law to the right or to the left then he and his descendants will reign a long time over his kingdom in israel the priests who are levites indeed the whole tribe of levi are to have no allotment or inheritance with israel they shall live on the offerings made to the lord by fire for that is their inheritance they shall have no inheritance among their brothers the lord is their inheritance as he promised them this is the share due the priests from the people who sacrifice a bull or a sheep the shoulder the jowls and the inner parts you are to give them the firstfruits of your grain new wine and oil and the first wool from the shearing of your sheep for the lord your god has chosen them and their descendants out of all your tribes to stand and minister in the lords name always if a levite moves from one of your towns anywhere in israel where he is living and comes in all earnestness to the place the lord will choose he may minister in the name of the lord his god like all his fellow levites who serve there in the presence of the lord he is to share equally in their benefits even though he has received money from the sale of family possessions when you enter the land the lord your god is giving you do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire who practices divination or sorcery interprets omens engages in witchcraft or casts spells or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead anyone who does these things is detestable to the lord and because of these detestable practices the lord your god will drive out those nations before you you must be blameless before the lord your god the nations you will dispossess listen to those who practice sorcery or divination but as for you the lord your god has not permitted you to do so the lord your god will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own brothers you must listen to him for this is what you asked of the lord your god at horeb on the day of the assembly when you said let us not hear the voice of the lord our god nor see this great fire anymore or we will die the lord said to me what they say is good i will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers i will put my words in his mouth and he will tell them everything i command him if anyone does not listen to my words that the prophet speaks in my name i myself will call him to account but a prophet who presumes to speak in my name anything i have not commanded him to say or a prophet who speaks in the name of other gods must be put to death you may say to yourselves how can we know when a message has not been spoken by the lord if what a prophet proclaims in the name of the lord does not take place or come true that is a message the lord has not spoken that prophet has spoken presumptuously do not be afraid of him when the lord your god has destroyed the nations whose land he is giving you and when you have driven them out and settled in their towns and houses then set aside for yourselves three cities centrally located in the land the lord your god is giving you to possess build roads to them and divide into three parts the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance so that anyone who kills a man may flee there this is the rule concerning the man who kills another and flees there to save his life one who kills his neighbor unintentionally without malice aforethought for instance a man may go into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood and as he swings his ax to fell a tree the head may fly off and hit his neighbor and kill him that man may flee to one of these cities and save his life otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue him in a rage overtake him if the distance is too great and kill him even though he is not deserving of death since he did it to his neighbor without malice aforethought this is why i command you to set aside for yourselves three cities if the lord your god enlarges your territory as he promised on oath to your forefathers and gives you the whole land he promised them because you carefully follow all these laws i command you today to love the lord your god and to walk always in his ways then you are to set aside three more cities do this so that innocent blood will not be shed in your land which the lord your god is giving you as your inheritance and so that you will not be guilty of bloodshed but if a man hates his neighbor and lies in wait for him assaults and kills him and then flees to one of these cities the elders of his town shall send for him bring him back from the city and hand him over to the avenger of blood to die show him no pity you must purge from israel the guilt of shedding innocent blood so that it may go well with you do not move your neighbors boundary stone set up by your predecessors in the inheritance you receive in the land the lord your god is giving you to possess one witness is not enough to convict a man accused of any crime or offense he may have committed a matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if a malicious witness takes the stand to accuse a man of a crime the two men involved in the dispute must stand in the presence of the lord before the priests and the judges who are in office at the time the judges must make a thorough investigation and if the witness proves to be a liar giving false testimony against his brother then do to him as he intended to do to his brother you must purge the evil from among you the rest of the people will hear of this and be afraid and never again will such an evil thing be done among you show no pity life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot when you go to war against your enemies and see horses and chariots and an army greater than yours do not be afraid of them because the lord your god who brought you up out of egypt will be with you when you are about to go into battle the priest shall come forward and address the army he shall say hear o israel today you are going into battle against your enemies do not be fainthearted or afraid do not be terrified or give way to panic before them for the lord your god is the one who goes with you to fight for you against your enemies to give you victory the officers shall say to the army has anyone built a new house and not dedicated it let him go home or he may die in battle and someone else may dedicate it has anyone planted a vineyard and not begun to enjoy it let him go home or he may die in battle and someone else enjoy it has anyone become pledged to a woman and not married her let him go home or he may die in battle and someone else marry her then the officers shall add is any man afraid or fainthearted let him go home so that his brothers will not become disheartened too when the officers have finished speaking to the army they shall appoint commanders over it when you march up to attack a city make its people an offer of peace if they accept and open their gates all the people in it shall be subject to forced labor and shall work for you if they refuse to make peace and they engage you in battle lay siege to that city when the lord your god delivers it into your hand put to the sword all the men in it as for the women the children the livestock and everything else in the city you may take these as plunder for yourselves and you may use the plunder the lord your god gives you from your enemies this is how you are to treat all the cities that are at a distance from you and do not belong to the nations nearby however in the cities of the nations the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance do not leave alive anything that breathes completely destroy them the hittites amorites canaanites perizzites hivites and jebusites as the lord your god has commanded you otherwise they will teach you to follow all the detestable things they do in worshiping their gods and you will sin against the lord your god when you lay siege to a city for a long time fighting against it to capture it do not destroy its trees by putting an ax to them because you can eat their fruit do not cut them down are the trees of the field people that you should besiege them however you may cut down trees that you know are not fruit trees and use them to build siege works until the city at war with you falls if a man is found slain lying in a field in the land the lord your god is giving you to possess and it is not known who killed him your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance from the body to the neighboring towns then the elders of the town nearest the body shall take a heifer that has never been worked and has never worn a yoke and lead her down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and where there is a flowing stream there in the valley they are to break the heifers neck the priests the sons of levi shall step forward for the lord your god has chosen them to minister and to pronounce blessings in the name of the lord and to decide all cases of dispute and assault then all the elders of the town nearest the body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley and they shall declare our hands did not shed this blood nor did our eyes see it done accept this atonement for your people israel whom you have redeemed o lord and do not hold your people guilty of the blood of an innocent man and the bloodshed will be atoned for so you will purge from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood since you have done what is right in the eyes of the lord when you go to war against your enemies and the lord your god delivers them into your hands and you take captives if you notice among the captives a beautiful woman and are attracted to her you may take her as your wife bring her into your home and have her shave her head trim her nails and put aside the clothes she was wearing when captured after she has lived in your house and mourned her father and mother for a full month then you may go to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife if you are not pleased with her let her go wherever she wishes you must not sell her or treat her as a slave since you have dishonored her if a man has two wives and he loves one but not the other and both bear him sons but the firstborn is the son of the wife he does not love when he wills his property to his sons he must not give the rights of the firstborn to the son of the wife he loves in preference to his actual firstborn the son of the wife he does not love he must acknowledge the son of his unloved wife as the firstborn by giving him a double share of all he has that son is the first sign of his fathers strength the right of the firstborn belongs to him if a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who does not obey his father and mother and will not listen to them when they discipline him his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him to the elders at the gate of his town they shall say to the elders this son of ours is stubborn and rebellious he will not obey us he is a profligate and a drunkard then all the men of his town shall stone him to death you must purge the evil from among you all israel will hear of it and be afraid if a man guilty of a capital offense is put to death and his body is hung on a tree you must not leave his body on the tree overnight be sure to bury him that same day because anyone who is hung on a tree is under gods curse you must not desecrate the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance if you see your brothers ox or sheep straying do not ignore it but be sure to take it back to him if the brother does not live near you or if you do not know who he is take it home with you and keep it until he comes looking for it then give it back to him do the same if you find your brothers donkey or his cloak or anything he loses do not ignore it if you see your brothers donkey or his ox fallen on the road do not ignore it help him get it to its feet a woman must not wear mens clothing nor a man wear womens clothing for the lord your god detests anyone who does this if you come across a birds nest beside the road either in a tree or on the ground and the mother is sitting on the young or on the eggs do not take the mother with the young you may take the young but be sure to let the mother go so that it may go well with you and you may have a long life when you build a new house make a parapet around your roof so that you may not bring the guilt of bloodshed on your house if someone falls from the roof do not plant two kinds of seed in your vineyard if you do not only the crops you plant but also the fruit of the vineyard will be defiled do not plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together do not wear clothes of wool and linen woven together make tassels on the four corners of the cloak you wear if a man takes a wife and after lying with her dislikes her and slanders her and gives her a bad name saying i married this woman but when i approached her i did not find proof of her virginity then the girls father and mother shall bring proof that she was a virgin to the town elders at the gate the girls father will say to the elders i gave my daughter in marriage to this man but he dislikes her now he has slandered her and said i did not find your daughter to be a virgin but here is the proof of my daughters virginity then her parents shall display the cloth before the elders of the town and the elders shall take the man and punish him they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give them to the girls father because this man has given an israelite virgin a bad name she shall continue to be his wife he must not divorce her as long as he lives if however the charge is true and no proof of the girls virginity can be found she shall be brought to the door of her fathers house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death she has done a disgraceful thing in israel by being promiscuous while still in her fathers house you must purge the evil from among you if a man is found sleeping with another mans wife both the man who slept with her and the woman must die you must purge the evil from israel if a man happens to meet in a town a virgin pledged to be married and he sleeps with her you shall take both of them to the gate of that town and stone them to death the girl because she was in a town and did not scream for help and the man because he violated another mans wife you must purge the evil from among you but if out in the country a man happens to meet a girl pledged to be married and rapes her only the man who has done this shall die do nothing to the girl she has committed no sin deserving death this case is like that of someone who attacks and murders his neighbor for the man found the girl out in the country and though the betrothed girl screamed there was no one to rescue her if a man happens to meet a virgin who is not pledged to be married and rapes her and they are discovered he shall pay the girls father fifty shekels of silver he must marry the girl for he has violated her he can never divorce her as long as he lives a man is not to marry his fathers wife he must not dishonor his fathers bed no one who has been emasculated by crushing or cutting may enter the assembly of the lord no one born of a forbidden marriage nor any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the lord even down to the tenth generation no ammonite or moabite or any of his descendants may enter the assembly of the lord even down to the tenth generation for they did not come to meet you with bread and water on your way when you came out of egypt and they hired balaam son of beor from pethor in aram naharaim to pronounce a curse on you however the lord your god would not listen to balaam but turned the curse into a blessing for you because the lord your god loves you do not seek a treaty of friendship with them as long as you live do not abhor an edomite for he is your brother do not abhor an egyptian because you lived as an alien in his country the third generation of children born to them may enter the assembly of the lord when you are encamped against your enemies keep away from everything impure if one of your men is unclean because of a nocturnal emission he is to go outside the camp and stay there but as evening approaches he is to wash himself and at sunset he may return to the camp designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself as part of your equipment have something to dig with and when you relieve yourself dig a hole and cover up your excrement for the lord your god moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you your camp must be holy so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you if a slave has taken refuge with you do not hand him over to his master let him live among you wherever he likes and in whatever town he chooses do not oppress him no israelite man or woman is to become a shrine prostitute you must not bring the earnings of a female prostitute or of a male prostitute into the house of the lord your god to pay any vow because the lord your god detests them both do not charge your brother interest whether on money or food or anything else that may earn interest you may charge a foreigner interest but not a brother israelite so that the lord your god may bless you in everything you put your hand to in the land you are entering to possess if you make a vow to the lord your god do not be slow to pay it for the lord your god will certainly demand it of you and you will be guilty of sin but if you refrain from making a vow you will not be guilty whatever your lips utter you must be sure to do because you made your vow freely to the lord your god with your own mouth if you enter your neighbors vineyard you may eat all the grapes you want but do not put any in your basket if you enter your neighbors grainfield you may pick kernels with your hands but you must not put a sickle to his standing grain if a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her and he writes her a certificate of divorce gives it to her and sends her from his house and if after she leaves his house she becomes the wife of another man and her second husband dislikes her and writes her a certificate of divorce gives it to her and sends her from his house or if he dies then her first husband who divorced her is not allowed to marry her again after she has been defiled that would be detestable in the eyes of the lord do not bring sin upon the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance if a man has recently married he must not be sent to war or have any other duty laid on him for one year he is to be free to stay at home and bring happiness to the wife he has married do not take a pair of millstones not even the upper one as security for a debt because that would be taking a mans livelihood as security if a man is caught kidnapping one of his brother israelites and treats him as a slave or sells him the kidnapper must die you must purge the evil from among you in cases of leprous diseases be very careful to do exactly as the priests who are levites instruct you you must follow carefully what i have commanded them remember what the lord your god did to miriam along the way after you came out of egypt when you make a loan of any kind to your neighbor do not go into his house to get what he is offering as a pledge stay outside and let the man to whom you are making the loan bring the pledge out to you if the man is poor do not go to sleep with his pledge in your possession return his cloak to him by sunset so that he may sleep in it then he will thank you and it will be regarded as a righteous act in the sight of the lord your god do not take advantage of a hired man who is poor and needy whether he is a brother israelite or an alien living in one of your towns pay him his wages each day before sunset because he is poor and is counting on it otherwise he may cry to the lord against you and you will be guilty of sin fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their fathers each is to die for his own sin do not deprive the alien or the fatherless of justice or take the cloak of the widow as a pledge remember that you were slaves in egypt and the lord your god redeemed you from there that is why i command you to do this when you are harvesting in your field and you overlook a sheaf do not go back to get it leave it for the alien the fatherless and the widow so that the lord your god may bless you in all the work of your hands when you beat the olives from your trees do not go over the branches a second time leave what remains for the alien the fatherless and the widow when you harvest the grapes in your vineyard do not go over the vines again leave what remains for the alien the fatherless and the widow remember that you were slaves in egypt that is why i command you to do this when men have a dispute they are to take it to court and the judges will decide the case acquitting the innocent and condemning the guilty if the guilty man deserves to be beaten the judge shall make him lie down and have him flogged in his presence with the number of lashes his crime deserves but he must not give him more than forty lashes if he is flogged more than that your brother will be degraded in your eyes do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain if brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son his widow must not marry outside the family her husbands brother shall take her and marry her and fulfill the duty of a brother in law to her the first son she bears shall carry on the name of the dead brother so that his name will not be blotted out from israel however if a man does not want to marry his brothers wife she shall go to the elders at the town gate and say my husbands brother refuses to carry on his brothers name in israel he will not fulfill the duty of a brother in law to me then the elders of his town shall summon him and talk to him if he persists in saying i do not want to marry her his brothers widow shall go up to him in the presence of the elders take off one of his sandals spit in his face and say this is what is done to the man who will not build up his brothers family line that mans line shall be known in israel as the family of the unsandaled if two men are fighting and the wife of one of them comes to rescue her husband from his assailant and she reaches out and seizes him by his private parts you shall cut off her hand show her no pity do not have two differing weights in your bag one heavy one light do not have two differing measures in your house one large one small you must have accurate and honest weights and measures so that you may live long in the land the lord your god is giving you for the lord your god detests anyone who does these things anyone who deals dishonestly remember what the amalekites did to you along the way when you came out of egypt when you were weary and worn out they met you on your journey and cut off all who were lagging behind they had no fear of god when the lord your god gives you rest from all the enemies around you in the land he is giving you to possess as an inheritance you shall blot out the memory of amalek from under heaven do not forget when you have entered the land the lord your god is giving you as an inheritance and have taken possession of it and settled in it take some of the firstfruits of all that you produce from the soil of the land the lord your god is giving you and put them in a basket then go to the place the lord your god will choose as a dwelling for his name and say to the priest in office at the time i declare today to the lord your god that i have come to the land the lord swore to our forefathers to give us the priest shall take the basket from your hands and set it down in front of the altar of the lord your god then you shall declare before the lord your god my father was a wandering aramean and he went down into egypt with a few people and lived there and became a great nation powerful and numerous but the egyptians mistreated us and made us suffer putting us to hard labor then we cried out to the lord the god of our fathers and the lord heard our voice and saw our misery toil and oppression so the lord brought us out of egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm with great terror and with miraculous signs and wonders he brought us to this place and gave us this land a land flowing with milk and honey and now i bring the firstfruits of the soil that you o lord have given me place the basket before the lord your god and bow down before him and you and the levites and the aliens among you shall rejoice in all the good things the lord your god has given to you and your household when you have finished setting aside a tenth of all your produce in the third year the year of the tithe you shall give it to the levite the alien the fatherless and the widow so that they may eat in your towns and be satisfied then say to the lord your god i have removed from my house the sacred portion and have given it to the levite the alien the fatherless and the widow according to all you commanded i have not turned aside from your commands nor have i forgotten any of them i have not eaten any of the sacred portion while i was in mourning nor have i removed any of it while i was unclean nor have i offered any of it to the dead i have obeyed the lord my god i have done everything you commanded me look down from heaven your holy dwelling place and bless your people israel and the land you have given us as you promised on oath to our forefathers a land flowing with milk and honey the lord your god commands you this day to

man among you will have no compassion on his own brother or the wife he loves or his surviving children and he will not give to one of them any of the flesh of his children that he is eating it will be all he has left because of the suffering your enemy will inflict on you during the siege of all your cities the most gentle and sensitive woman among you so sensitive and gentle that she would not venture to touch the ground with the sole of her foot will begrudge the husband she loves and her own son or daughter the afterbirth from her womb and the children she bears for she intends to eat them secretly during the siege and in the distress that your enemy will inflict on you in your cities if you do not carefully follow all the words of this law which are written in this book and do not revere this glorious and awesome name the lord your god the lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants harsh and prolonged disasters and severe and lingering illnesses he will bring upon you all the diseases of egypt that you dreaded and they will cling to you the lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this book of the law until you are destroyed you who were as numerous as the stars in the sky will be left but few in number because you did not obey the lord your god just as it pleased the lord to make you prosper and increase in number so it will please him to ruin and destroy you you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess then the lord will scatter you among all nations from one end of the earth to the other there you will worship other gods gods of wood and stone which neither you nor your fathers have known among those nations you will find no repose no resting place for the sole of your foot there the lord will give you an anxious mind eyes weary with longing and a despairing heart you will live in constant suspense filled with dread both night and day never sure of your life in the morning you will say if only it were evening and in the evening if only it were morning because of the terror that will fill your hearts and the sights that your eyes will see the lord will send you back in ships to egypt on a journey i said you should never make again there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves but no one will buy you these are the terms of the covenant the lord commanded moses to make with the israelites in moab in addition to the covenant he had made with them at horeb moses summoned all the israelites and said to them your eyes have seen all that the lord did in egypt to pharaoh to all his officials and to all his land with your own eyes you saw those great trials those miraculous signs and great wonders but to this day the lord has not given you a mind that understands or eyes that see or ears that hear during the forty years that i led you through the desert your clothes did not wear out nor did the sandals on your feet you ate no bread and drank no wine or other fermented drink i did this so that you might know that i am the lord your god when you reached this place sihon king of heshbon and og king of bashan came out to fight against us but we defeated them we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the reubenites the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh carefully follow the terms of this covenant so that you may prosper in everything you do all of you are standing today in the presence of the lord your god your leaders and chief men your elders and officials and all the other men of israel together with your children and your wives and the aliens living in your camps who chop your wood and carry your water you are standing here in order to enter into a covenant with the lord your god a covenant the lord is making with you this day and sealing with an oath to confirm you this day as his people that he may be your god as he promised you and as he swore to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob i am making this covenant with its oath not only with you who are standing here with us today in the presence of the lord our god but also with those who are not here today you yourselves know how we lived in egypt and how we passed through the countries on the way here you saw among them their detestable images and idols of wood and stone of silver and gold make sure there is no man or woman clan or tribe among you today whose heart turns away from the lord our god to go and worship the gods of those nations make sure there is no root among you that produces such bitter poison when such a person hears the words of this oath he invokes a blessing on himself and therefore thinks i will be safe even though i persist in going my own way this will bring disaster on the watered land as well as the dry the lord will never be willing to forgive him his wrath and zeal will burn against that man all the curses written in this book will fall upon him and the lord will blot out his name from under heaven the lord will single him out from all the tribes of israel for disaster according to all the curses of the covenant written in this book of the law your children who follow you in later generations and foreigners who come from distant lands will see the calamities that have fallen on the land and the diseases with which the lord has afflicted it the whole land will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur nothing planted nothing sprouting no vegetation growing on it it will be like the destruction of sodom and gomorrah admah and zeboiim which the lord overthrew in fierce anger all the nations will ask why has the lord done this to this land why this fierce burning anger and the answer will be it is because this people abandoned the covenant of the lord the god of their fathers the covenant he made with them when he brought them out of egypt they went off and worshiped other gods and bowed down to them gods they did not know gods he had not given them therefore the lords anger burned against this land so that he brought on it all the curses written in this book in furious anger and in great wrath the lord uprooted them from their land and thrust them into another land as it is now the secret things belong to the lord our god but the things revealed belong to us and to our children forever that we may follow all the words of this law when all these blessings and curses i have set before you come upon you and you take them to heart wherever the lord your god disperses you among the nations and when you and your children return to the lord your god and obey him with all your heart and with all your soul according to everything i command you today then the lord your god will restore your fortunes and have compassion on you and gather you again from all the nations where he scattered you even if you have been banished to the most distant land under the heavens from there the lord your god will gather you and bring you back he will bring you to the land that belonged to your fathers and you will take possession of it he will make you more prosperous and numerous than your fathers the lord your god will circumcise your hearts and the hearts of your descendants so that you may love him with all your heart and with all your soul and live the lord your god will put all these curses on your enemies who hate and persecute you you will again obey the lord and follow all his commands i am giving you today then the lord your god will make you most prosperous in all the work of your hands and in the fruit of your womb the young of your livestock and the crops of your land the lord will again delight in you and make you prosperous just as he delighted in your fathers if you obey the lord your god and keep his commands and decrees that are written in this book of the law and turn to the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul the offer of life or death now what i am commanding you today is not too difficult for you or beyond your reach it is not up in heaven so that you have to ask who will ascend into heaven to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it nor is it beyond the sea so that you have to ask who will cross the sea to get it and proclaim it to us so we may obey it no the word is very near you it is in your mouth and in your heart so you may obey it see i set before you today life and prosperity death and destruction for i command you today to love the lord your god to walk in his ways and to keep his commands decrees and laws then you will live and increase and the lord your god will bless you in the land you are entering to possess but if your heart turns away and you are not obedient and if you are drawn away to bow down to other gods and worship them i declare to you this day that you will certainly be destroyed you will not live long in the land you are crossing the jordan to enter and possess this day i call heaven and earth as witnesses against you that i have set before you life and death blessings and curses now choose life so that you and your children may live and that you may love the lord your god listen to his voice and hold fast to him for the lord is your life and he will give you many years in the land he swore to give to your fathers abraham isaac and jacob then moses went out and spoke these words to all israel i am now a hundred and twenty years old and i am no longer able to lead you the lord has said to me you shall not cross the jordan the lord your god himself will cross over ahead of you he will destroy these nations before you and you will take possession of their land joshua also will cross over ahead of you as the lord said and the lord will do to them what he did to sihon and og the kings of the amorites whom he destroyed along with their land the lord will deliver them to you and you must do to them all that i have commanded you be strong and courageous do not be afraid or terrified because of them for the lord your god goes with you he will never leave you nor forsake you then moses summoned joshua and said to him in the presence of all israel be strong and courageous for you must go with this people into the land that the lord swore to their forefathers to give them and you must divide it among them as their inheritance the lord himself goes before you and will be with you he will never leave you nor forsake you do not be afraid do not be discouraged so moses wrote down this law and gave it to the priests the sons of levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the lord and to all the elders of israel then moses commanded them at the end of every seven years in the year for canceling debts during the feast of tabernacles when all israel comes to appear before the lord your god at the place he will choose you shall read this law before them in their hearing assemble the people men women and children and the aliens living in your towns so they can listen and learn to fear the lord your god and follow carefully all the words of this law their children who do not know this law must hear it and learn to fear the lord your god as long as you live in the land you are crossing the jordan to possess the lord said to moses now the day of your death is near call joshua and present yourselves at the tent of meeting where i will commission him so moses and joshua came and presented themselves at the tent of meeting then the lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud and the cloud stood over the entrance to the tent and the lord said to moses you are going to rest with your fathers and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering they will forsake me and break the covenant i made with them on that day i will become angry with them and forsake them i will hide my face from them and they will be destroyed many disasters and difficulties will come upon them and on that day they will ask have not these disasters come upon us because our god is not with us and i will certainly hide my face on that day because of all their wickedness in turning to other gods now write down for yourselves this song and teach it to the israelites and have them sing it so that it may be a witness for me against them when i have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey the land i promised on oath to their forefathers and when they eat their fill and thrive they will turn to other gods and worship them rejecting me and breaking my covenant and when many disasters and difficulties come upon them this song will testify against them because it will not be forgotten by their descendants i know what they are disposed to do even before i bring them into the land i promised them on oath so moses wrote down this song that day and taught it to the israelites the lord gave this command to joshua son of nun be strong and courageous for you will bring the israelites into the land i promised them on oath and i myself will be with you after moses finished writing in a book the words of this law from beginning to end he gave this command to the levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the lord take this book of the law and place it beside the ark of the covenant of the lord your god there it will remain as a witness against you for i know how rebellious and stiff necked you are if you have been rebellious against the lord while i am still alive and with you how much more will you rebel after i die assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and all your officials so that i can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth to testify against them for i know that after my death you are sure to become utterly corrupt and to turn from the way i have commanded you in days to come disaster will fall upon you because you will do evil in the sight of the lord and provoke him to anger by what your hands have made and moses recited the words of this song from beginning to end in the hearing of the whole assembly of israel listen o heavens and i will speak hear o earth the words of my mouth let my teaching fall like rain and my words descend like dew like showers on new grass like abundant rain on tender plants i will proclaim the name of the lord oh praise the greatness of our god he is the rock his works are perfect and all his ways are just a faithful god who does no wrong upright and just is he they have acted corruptly toward him to their shame they are no longer his children but a warped and crooked generation is this the way you repay the lord o foolish and unwise people is he not your father your creator who made you and formed you remember the days of old consider the generations long past ask your father and he will tell you your elders and they will explain to you when the most high gave the nations their inheritance when he divided all mankind he set up boundaries for the peoples according to the number of the sons of israel for the lords portion is his people jacob his allotted inheritance in a desert land he found him in a barren and howling waste he shielded him and cared for him he guarded him as the apple of his eye like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them on its pinions the lord alone led him no foreign god was with him he made him ride on the heights of the land and fed him with the fruit of the fields he nourished him with honey from the rock and with oil from the flinty crag with curds and milk from herd and flock and with fattened lambs and goats with choice rams of bashan and the finest kernels of wheat you drank the foaming blood of the grape jeshurun grew fat and kicked filled with food he became heavy and sleek he abandoned the god who made him and rejected the rock his savior they made him jealous with their foreign gods and angered him with their detestable idols they sacrificed to demons which are not god gods they had not known gods that recently appeared gods your fathers did not fear you deserted the rock who fathered you you forgot the god who gave you birth the lord saw this and rejected them because he was angered by his sons and daughters i will hide my face from them he said and see what their end will be for they are a perverse generation children who are unfaithful they made me jealous by what is no god and angered me with their worthless idols i will make them envious by those who are not a people i will make them angry by a nation that has no understanding for a fire has been kindled by my wrath one that burns to the realm of death below it will devour the earth and its harvests and set afire the foundations of the mountains i will heap calamities upon them and spend my arrows against them i will send wasting famine against them consuming pestilence and deadly plague i will send against them the fangs of wild beasts the venom of vipers that glide in the dust in the street the sword will make them childless in their homes terror will reign young men and young women will perish infants and gray haired men i said i would scatter them and blot out their memory from mankind but i dreaded the taunt of the enemy lest the adversary misunderstand and say our hand has triumphed the lord has not done all this they are a nation without sense there is no discernment in them if only they were wise and would understand this and discern what their end will be how could one man chase a thousand or two put ten thousand to flight unless their rock had sold them unless the lord had given them up for their rock is not like our rock as even our enemies concede their vine comes from the vine of sodom and from the fields of gomorrah their grapes are filled with poison and their clusters with bitterness their wine is the venom of serpents the deadly poison of cobras have i not kept this in reserve and sealed it in my vaults it is mine to avenge i will repay in due time their foot will slip their day of disaster is near and their doom rushes upon them the lord will judge his people and have compassion on his servants when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left slave or free he

take vengeance on his enemies and make atonement for his land and people moses came with joshua son of nun and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people when moses finished reciting all these words to all israel he said to them take to heart all the words i have solemnly declared to you this day so that you may command your children to obey carefully all the words of this law they are not just idle words for you they are your life by them you will live long in the land you are crossing the jordan to possess on that same day the lord told moses go up into the abarim range to mount nebo in moab across from jericho and view canaan the land i am giving the israelites as their own possession there on the mountain that you have climbed you will die and be gathered to your people just as your brother aaron died on mount hor and was gathered to his people this is because both of you broke faith with me in the presence of the israelites at the waters of meribah kadesh in the desert of zin and because you did not uphold my holiness among the israelites therefore you will see the land only from a distance you will not enter the land i am giving to the people of israel this is the blessing that moses the man of god pronounced on the israelites before his death he said the lord came from sinai and dawned over them from seir he shone forth from mount paran he came with myriads of holy ones from the south from his mountain slopes surely it is you who love the people all the holy ones are in your hand at your feet they all bow down and from you receive instruction the law that moses gave us the possession of the assembly of jacob he was king over jeshurun when the leaders of the people assembled along with the tribes of israel let reuben live and not die nor his men be few and this he said about judah hear o lord the cry of judah bring him to his people with his own hands he defends his cause oh be his help against his foes about levi he said your thummim and urim belong to the man you favored you tested him at massah you contended with him at the waters of meribah he said of his father and mother i have no regard for them he did not recognize his brothers or acknowledge his own children but he watched over your word and guarded your covenant he teaches your precepts to jacob and your law to israel he offers incense before you and whole burnt offerings on your altar bless all his skills o lord and be pleased with the work of his hands smite the loins of those who rise up against him strike his foes till they rise no more about benjamin he said let the beloved of the lord rest secure in him for he shields him all day long and the one the lord loves rests between his shoulders about joseph he said may the lord bless his land with the precious dew from heaven above and with the deep waters that lie below with the best the sun brings forth and the finest the moon can yield with the choicest gifts of the ancient mountains and the fruitfulness of the everlasting hills with the best gifts of the earth and its fullness and the favor of him who dwelt in the burning bush let all these rest on the head of joseph on the brow of the prince among his brothers in majesty he is like a firstborn bull his horns are the horns of a wild ox with them he will gore the nations even those at the ends of the earth such are the ten thousands of ephraim such are the thousands of manasseh about zebulun he said rejoice zebulun in your going out and you issachar in your tents they will summon peoples to the mountain and there offer sacrifices of righteousness they will feast on the abundance of the seas on the treasures hidden in the sand about gad he said blessed is he who enlarges gads domain gad lives there like a lion tearing at arm or head he chose the best land for himself the leaders portion was kept for him when the heads of the people assembled he carried out the lords righteous will and his judgments concerning israel about dan he said dan is a lions cub springing out of bashan about naphtali he said naphtali is abounding with the favor of the lord and is full of his blessing he will inherit southward to the lake about asher he said most blessed of sons is asher let him be favored by his brothers and let him bathe his feet in oil the bolts of your gates will be iron and bronze and your strength will equal your days there is no one like the god of jeshurun who rides on the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty the eternal god is your refuge and underneath are the everlasting arms he will drive out your enemy before you saying destroy him so israel will live in safety alone jacobs spring is secure in a land of grain and new wine where the heavens drop dew blessed are you o israel who is like you a people saved by the lord he is your shield and helper and your glorious sword your enemies will cower before you and you will trample down their high places then moses climbed mount nebo from the plains of moab to the top of pisgah across from jericho there the lord showed him the whole land from gilead to dan all of naphtali the territory of ephraim and manasseh all the land of judah as far as the western sea the negev and the whole region from the valley of jericho the city of palms as far as zoar then the lord said to him this is the land i promised on oath to abraham isaac and jacob when i said i will give it to your descendants i have let you see it with your eyes but you will not cross over into it and moses the servant of the lord died there in moab as the lord had said he buried him in moab in the valley opposite beth peor but to this day no one knows where his grave is moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died yet his eyes were not weak nor his strength gone the israelites grieved for moses in the plains of moab thirty days until the time of weeping and mourning was over now joshua son of nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom because moses had laid his hands on him so the israelites listened to him and did what the lord had commanded moses since then no prophet has risen in israel like moses whom the lord knew face to face who did all those miraculous signs and wonders the lord sent him to do in egypt to pharaoh and to all his officials and to his whole land for no one has ever shown the mighty power or performed the awesome deeds that moses did in the sight of all israel  after the death of moses the servant of the lord the lord said to joshua son of nun moses aide moses my servant is dead now then you and all these people get ready to cross the jordan river into the land i am about to give to them to the israelites i will give you every place where you set your foot as i promised moses your territory will extend from the desert to lebanon and from the great river the euphrates all the hittite country to the great sea on the west no one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life as i was with moses so i will be with you i will never leave you nor forsake you be strong and courageous because you will lead these people to inherit the land i swore to their forefathers to give them be strong and very courageous be careful to obey all the law my servant moses gave you do not turn from it to the right or to the left that you may be successful wherever you go do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth meditate on it day and night so that you may be careful to do everything written in it then you will be prosperous and successful have i not commanded you be strong and courageous do not be terrified do not be discouraged for the lord your god will be with you wherever you go so joshua ordered the officers of the people go through the camp and tell the people get your supplies ready three days from now you will cross the jordan here to go in and take possession of the land the lord your god is giving you for your own but to the reubenites the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh joshua said remember the command that moses the servant of the lord gave you the lord your god is giving you rest and has granted you this land your wives your children and your livestock may stay in the land that moses gave you east of the jordan but all your fighting men fully armed must cross over ahead of your brothers you are to help your brothers until the lord gives them rest as he has done for you and until they too have taken possession of the land that the lord your god is giving them after that you may go back and occupy your own land which moses the servant of the lord gave you east of the jordan toward the sunrise then they answered joshua whatever you have commanded us we will do and wherever you send us we will go just as we fully obeyed moses so we will obey you only may the lord your god be with you as he was with moses whoever rebels against your word and does not obey your words whatever you may command them will be put to death only be strong and courageous then joshua son of nun secretly sent two spies from shittim go look over the land he said especially jericho so they went and entered the house of a prostitute named rahab and stayed there the king of jericho was told look some of the israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land so the king of jericho sent this message to rahab bring out the men who came to you and entered your house because they have come to spy out the whole land but the woman had taken the two men and hidden them she said yes the men came to me but i did not know where they had come from at dusk when it was time to close the city gate the men left i dont know which way they went go after them quickly you may catch up with them but she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them under the stalks of flax she had laid out on the roof so the men set out in pursuit of the spies on the road that leads to the fords of the jordan and as soon as the pursuers had gone out the gate was shut before the spies lay down for the night she went up on the roof and said to them i know that the lord has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did to sihon and og the two kings of the amorites east of the jordan whom you completely destroyed when we heard of it our hearts melted and everyones courage failed because of you for the lord your god is god in heaven above and on the earth below now then please swear to me by the lord that you will show kindness to my family because i have shown kindness to you give me a sure sign that you will spare the lives of my father and mother my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them and that you will save us from death our lives for your lives the men assured her if you dont tell what we are doing we will treat you kindly and faithfully when the lord gives us the land so she let them down by a rope through the window for the house she lived in was part of the city wall now she had said to them go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you hide yourselves there three days until they return and then go on your way the men said to her this oath you made us swear will not be binding on us unless when we enter the land you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down and unless you have brought your father and mother your brothers and all your family into your house if anyone goes outside your house into the street his blood will be on his own head we will not be responsible as for anyone who is in the house with you his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him but if you tell what we are doing we will be released from the oath you made us swear agreed she replied let it be as you say so she sent them away and they departed and she tied the scarlet cord in the window when they left they went into the hills and stayed there three days until the pursuers had searched all along the road and returned without finding them then the two men started back they went down out of the hills forded the river and came to joshua son of nun and told him everything that had happened to them they said to joshua the lord has surely given the whole land into our hands all the people are melting in fear because of us early in the morning joshua and all the israelites set out from shittim and went to the jordan where they camped before crossing over after three days the officers went throughout the camp giving orders to the people when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests who are levites carrying it you are to move out from your positions and follow it then you will know which way to go since you have never been this way before but keep a distance of about a thousand yards between you and the ark do not go near it joshua told the people consecrate yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do amazing things among you joshua said to the priests take up the ark of the covenant and pass on ahead of the people so they took it up and went ahead of them and the lord said to joshua today i will begin to exalt you in the eyes of all israel so they may know that i am with you as i was with moses tell the priests who carry the ark of the covenant when you reach the edge of the jordans waters go and stand in the river joshua said to the israelites come here and listen to the words of the lord your god this is how you will know that the living god is among you and that he will certainly drive out before you the canaanites hittites hivites perizzites girgashites amorites and jebusites see the ark of the covenant of the lord of all the earth will go into the jordan ahead of you now then choose twelve men from the tribes of israel one from each tribe and as soon as the priests who carry the ark of the lord the lord of all the earth set foot in the jordan its waters flowing downstream will be cut off and stand up in a heap so when the people broke camp to cross the jordan the priests carrying the ark of the covenant went ahead of them now the jordan is at flood stage all during harvest yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the jordan and their feet touched the waters edge the water from upstream stopped flowing it piled up in a heap a great distance away at a town called adam in the vicinity of zarethan while the water flowing down to the sea of the arabah the salt sea  was completely cut off so the people crossed over opposite jericho the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the jordan while all israel passed by until the whole nation had completed the crossing on dry ground when the whole nation had finished crossing the jordan the lord said to joshua choose twelve men from among the people one from each tribe and tell them to take up twelve stones from the middle of the jordan from right where the priests stood and to carry them over with you and put them down at the place where you stay tonight so joshua called together the twelve men he had appointed from the israelites one from each tribe and said to them go over before the ark of the lord your god into the middle of the jordan each of you is to take up a stone on his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the israelites to serve as a sign among you in the future when your children ask you what do these stones mean tell them that the flow of the jordan was cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord when it crossed the jordan the waters of the jordan were cut off these stones are to be a memorial to the people of israel forever so the israelites did as joshua commanded them they took twelve stones from the middle of the jordan according to the number of the tribes of the israelites as the lord had told joshua and they carried them over with them to their camp where they put them down joshua set up the twelve stones that had been in the middle of the jordan at the spot where the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had stood and they are there to this day now the priests who carried the ark remained standing in the middle of the jordan until everything the lord had commanded joshua was done by the people just as moses had directed joshua the people hurried over and as soon as all of them had crossed the ark of the lord and the priests came to the other side while the people watched the men of reuben gad and the half tribe of manasseh crossed over armed in front of the israelites as moses had directed them about forty thousand armed for battle crossed over before the lord to the plains of jericho for war that day the lord exalted joshua in the sight of all israel and they revered him all the days of his life just as they had revered moses then the lord said to joshua command the priests carrying the ark of the testimony to come up out of the jordan so joshua commanded the priests come up out of the jordan and the priests came up out of the river carrying the ark of the covenant of the lord no sooner had they set their feet on the dry ground than the waters of the jordan returned to their place and ran at flood stage as before on the tenth day of the first month the people went up from the jordan and camped at gilgal on the eastern border of jericho and joshua set up at gilgal the twelve stones they had taken out of the jordan he said to the israelites in the future when your descendants ask their fathers what do these stones mean tell them israel crossed the jordan on dry ground for the lord your god dried up the jordan before you until you had crossed over the lord your god did to the jordan just what he had done to the red sea when he dried it up before us until we had crossed over he did this so that all the peoples of the earth might know that the hand of the lord is powerful and so that you might always fear the lord your god now when all the amorite kings west of the jordan and all the canaanite kings along the coast heard how the lord had dried up the jordan before the israelites until we had crossed over their hearts melted and they no longer had the courage to face the israelites at that time the lord said to joshua make flint knives and circumcise the israelites again so joshua made flint knives and circumcised the israelites at gibeath haaraloth now this is why he did so all those who came out of egypt all the men of military age died in the desert on the way after leaving egypt all the people that came out had been circumcised but all the people born in the desert during the journey from egypt had not the israelites had moved about in the desert forty years until all the men who were of military age when they left egypt had died since they had not obeyed the lord for the lord had sworn to them that they would not see the land that he had solemnly promised their fathers to give us a land flowing with milk and honey so he raised up their sons in their place and these were the ones joshua circumcised they were still uncircumcised because they had not been circumcised on the way and after the whole nation had been circumcised they remained where they were in camp until they were healed then the lord said to joshua today i have rolled away the reproach of egypt from you so the place has been called gilgal to this day on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month while camped at gilgal on the plains of jericho the israelites celebrated the passover the day after the passover that very day they ate some of the produce of the land unleavened bread and roasted grain the manna stopped the day after they ate this food from the land there was no longer any manna for the israelites but that year they ate of the produce of canaan now when joshua was near jericho he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand joshua went up to him and asked are you for us or for our enemies neither he replied but as commander of the army of the lord i have now come then joshua fell facedown to the ground in reverence and asked him what message does my lord have for his servant the commander of the lords army replied take off your sandals for the place where you are standing is holy and joshua did so now jericho was tightly shut up because of the israelites no one went out and no one came in then the lord said to joshua see i have delivered jericho into your hands along with its king and its fighting men march around the city once with all the armed men do this for six days have seven priests carry trumpets of rams horns in front of the ark on the seventh day march around the city seven times with the priests blowing the trumpets when you hear them sound a long blast on the trumpets have all the people give a loud shout then the wall of the city will collapse and the people will go up every man straight in so joshua son of nun called the priests and said to them take up the ark of the covenant of the lord and have seven priests carry trumpets in front of it and he ordered the people advance march around the city with the armed guard going ahead of the ark of the lord when joshua had spoken to the people the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets before the lord went forward blowing their trumpets and the ark of the lords covenant followed them the armed guard marched ahead of the priests who blew the trumpets and the rear guard followed the ark all this time the trumpets were sounding but joshua had commanded the people do not give a war cry do not raise your voices do not say a word until the day i tell you to shout then shout so he had the ark of the lord carried around the city circling it once then the people returned to camp and spent the night there joshua got up early the next morning and the priests took up the ark of the lord the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets went forward marching before the ark of the lord and blowing the trumpets the armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard followed the ark of the lord while the trumpets kept sounding so on the second day they marched around the city once and returned to the camp they did this for six days on the seventh day they got up at daybreak and marched around the city seven times in the same manner except that on that day they circled the city seven times the seventh time around when the priests sounded the trumpet blast joshua commanded the people shout for the lord has given you the city the city and all that is in it are to be devoted to the lord only rahab the prostitute and all who are with her in her house shall be spared because she hid the spies we sent but keep away from the devoted things so that you will not bring about your own destruction by taking any of them otherwise you will make the camp of israel liable to destruction and bring trouble on it all the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron are sacred to the lord and must go into his treasury when the trumpets sounded the people shouted and at the sound of the trumpet when the people gave a loud shout the wall collapsed so every man charged straight in and they took the city they devoted the city to the lord and destroyed with the sword every living thing in it men and women young and old cattle sheep and donkeys joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land go into the prostitutes house and bring her out and all who belong to her in accordance with your oath to her so the young men who had done the spying went in and brought out rahab her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her they brought out her entire family and put them in a place outside the camp of israel then they burned the whole city and everything in it but they put the silver and gold and the articles of bronze and iron into the treasury of the lords house but joshua spared rahab the prostitute with her family and all who belonged to her because she hid the men joshua had sent as spies to jericho and she lives among the israelites to this day at that time joshua pronounced this solemn oath cursed before the lord is the man who undertakes to rebuild this city jericho at the cost of his firstborn son will he lay its foundations at the cost of his youngest will he set up its gates so the lord was with joshua and his fame spread throughout the land but the israelites acted unfaithfully in regard to the devoted things achan son of carmi the son of zimri the son of zerah of the tribe of judah took some of them so the lords anger burned against israel now joshua sent men from jericho to ai which is near beth aven to the east of bethel and told them go up and spy out the region so the men went up and spied out ai when they returned to joshua they said not all the people will have to go up against ai send two or three thousand men to take it and do not weary all the people for only a few men are there so about three thousand men went up but they were routed by the men of ai who killed about thirty six of them they chased the israelites from the city gate as far as the stone quarries and struck them down on the slopes at this the hearts of the people melted and became like water then joshua tore his clothes and fell facedown to the ground before the ark of the lord remaining there till evening the elders of israel did the same and sprinkled dust on their heads and joshua said ah sovereign lord why did you ever bring this people across the jordan to deliver us into the hands of the amorites to destroy us if only we had been content to stay on the other side of the jordan o lord what can i say now that israel has been routed by its enemies the canaanites and the other people of the country will hear about this and they will surround us and wipe out our name from the earth what then will you do for your own great name the lord said to joshua stand up what are you doing down on your face israel has sinned they have violated my covenant which i commanded them to keep they have taken some of the devoted things they have stolen they have lied they have put them with their own possessions that is why the israelites cannot stand against their enemies they turn their backs and run because they have been made liable to destruction i will not be with you anymore unless you destroy whatever among you is devoted to destruction go consecrate the people tell them consecrate yourselves in preparation for tomorrow for this is what the lord the god of israel says that which is devoted is among you o israel you cannot stand against your enemies until you remove it in the morning present yourselves tribe by tribe the tribe that the lord takes shall come forward clan by clan the clan that the lord takes shall come forward family by family and the family that the lord takes shall come forward man by man he who is caught with the devoted things shall be destroyed by fire along with all that belongs to him he has violated the covenant of the lord and has done a disgraceful thing in israel early the next morning joshua had israel come forward by tribes and judah was taken the clans of judah came forward and he took the zerahites he had the clan of the zerahites come forward by families and zimri was taken joshua had his family come forward man by man and achan son of carmi the son of zimri the son of zerah of the tribe of judah was taken then joshua said to achan my son give glory to the lord the god of israel and give him the praise tell me what you have done do not hide it from me achan replied it is true i have sinned against the lord the god of israel this is what i have done when i saw in the plunder a beautiful robe from babylonia two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold weighing fifty shekels i coveted them and took them they are hidden in the ground inside my tent with the silver underneath so joshua sent messengers and they ran to the tent and there it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath they took the things from the tent brought them to joshua and all the israelites and spread them out before the lord then joshua together with all israel took achan son of zerah the silver the robe the gold wedge his sons and daughters his cattle donkeys and sheep his tent and all that he had to the valley of achor joshua said why have you brought this trouble on us the lord will bring trouble on you today then all israel stoned him and after they had stoned the rest they burned them over achan they heaped up a large pile of rocks which remains to this day then the lord turned from his fierce anger therefore that place has been called the valley of achor ever since then the lord said to joshua do not be afraid do not be discouraged take the whole army with you and go up and attack ai for i have delivered into your hands the king of ai his people his city and his land you shall do to ai and its king as you did to jericho and its king except that you may carry off their plunder and livestock for yourselves set an ambush behind the city so joshua and the whole army moved out to attack ai he chose thirty thousand of his best fighting men and sent them out at night with these orders listen carefully you are to set an ambush behind the city dont go very far from it all of you be on the alert i and all those with me will advance on the city and when the men come out against us as they did before we will flee from them they will pursue us until we have lured them away from the city for they will say they are running away from us as they did before so when we flee from them you are to rise up from ambush and take the city the lord your god will give it into your hand when you have taken the city set it on fire do what the lord has commanded see to it you have my orders then joshua sent them off and they went to the place of ambush and lay in wait between bethel and ai to the west of ai but joshua spent that night with the people early the next morning joshua mustered his men and he and the leaders of israel marched before them to ai the entire force that was with him marched up and approached the city and arrived in front of it they set up camp north of ai with the valley between them and the city joshua had taken about five thousand men and set them in ambush between bethel and ai to the west of the city they had the soldiers take up their positions all those in the camp to the north of the city and the ambush to the west of it that night joshua went into the valley when the king of ai saw this he and all the men of the city hurried out early in the morning to meet israel in battle at a certain place overlooking the arabah but he did not know that an ambush had been set against him behind the city joshua and all israel let themselves be driven back before them and they fled toward the desert all the men of ai were called to pursue them and they pursued joshua and were lured away from the city not a man remained in ai or bethel who did not go after israel they left the city open and went in pursuit of israel then the lord said to joshua hold out toward ai the javelin that is in your hand for into your hand i will deliver the city so joshua held out his javelin toward ai as soon as he did this the men in the ambush rose quickly from their position and rushed forward they entered the city and captured it and quickly set it on fire the men of ai looked back and saw the smoke of the city rising against the sky but they had no chance to escape in any direction for the israelites who had been fleeing toward the desert had turned back against their pursuers for when joshua and all israel saw that the ambush had taken the city and that smoke was going up from the city they turned around and attacked the men of ai the men of the ambush also came out of the city against them so that they were caught in the middle with israelites on both sides israel cut them down leaving them neither survivors nor fugitives but they took the king of ai alive and brought him to joshua when israel had finished killing all the men of ai in the fields and in the desert where they had chased them and when every one of them had been put to the sword all the israelites returned to ai and killed those who were in it twelve thousand men and women fell that day all the people of ai for joshua did not draw back the hand that held out his javelin until he had destroyed all who lived in ai but israel did carry off for themselves the livestock and plunder of this city as the lord had instructed joshua so joshua burned ai and made it a permanent heap of ruins a desolate place to this day he hung the king of ai on a tree and left him there until evening at sunset joshua ordered them to take his body from the tree and throw it down at the entrance of the city gate and they raised a large pile of rocks over it which remains to this day then joshua built on mount ebal an altar to the lord the god of israel as moses the servant of the lord had commanded the israelites he built it according to what is written in the book of the law of moses an altar of uncut stones on which no iron tool had been used on it they offered to the lord burnt offerings and sacrificed fellowship offerings there in the presence of the israelites joshua copied on stones the law of moses which he had written all israel aliens and citizens alike with their elders officials and judges were standing on both sides of the ark of the covenant of the lord facing those who carried it the priests who were levites half of the people stood in front of mount gerizim and half of them in front of mount ebal as moses the servant of the lord had formerly commanded when he gave instructions to bless the people of israel afterward joshua read all the words of the law the blessings and the curses just as it is written in the book of the law there was not a word of all that moses had commanded that joshua did not read to the whole assembly of israel including the women and children and the aliens who lived among them now when all the kings west of the jordan heard about these things those in the hill country in the western foothills and along the entire coast of the great sea as far as lebanon the kings of the hittites amorites canaanites perizzites hivites and jebusites they came together to make war against joshua and israel however when the people of gibeon heard what joshua had done to jericho and ai they resorted to a ruse they went as a delegation whose donkeys were loaded with worn out sacks and old wineskins cracked and mended the men put worn and patched sandals on their feet and wore old clothes all the bread of their food supply was dry and moldy then they went to joshua in the camp at gilgal and said to him and the men of israel we have come from a distant country make a treaty with us the men of israel said to the hivites but perhaps you live near us how then can we make a treaty with you we are your servants they said to joshua but joshua asked who are you and where do you come from they answered your servants have come from a very distant country because of the fame of the lord your god for we have heard reports of him all that he did in egypt and all that he did to the two kings of the amorites east of the jordan sihon king of heshbon and og king of bashan who reigned in ashtaroth and our elders and all those living in our country said to us take provisions for your journey go and meet them and say to them we are your servants make a treaty with us this bread of ours was warm when we packed it at home on the day we left to come to you but now see how dry and moldy it is and these wineskins that we filled were new but see how cracked they are and our clothes and sandals are worn out by the very long journey the men of israel sampled their provisions but did not inquire of the lord then joshua made a treaty of peace with them to let them live and the leaders of the assembly ratified it by oath three days after they made the treaty with the gibeonites the israelites heard that they were neighbors living near them so the israelites set out and on the third day came to their cities gibeon kephirah beeroth and kiriath jearim but the israelites did not attack them because the leaders of the assembly had sworn an oath to them by the lord the god of israel the whole assembly grumbled against the leaders but all the leaders answered we have given them our oath by the lord the god of israel and we cannot touch them now this is what we will do to them we will let them live so that wrath will not fall on us for breaking the oath we swore to them they continued let them live but let them be woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community so the leaders promise to them was kept then joshua summoned the gibeonites and said why did you deceive us by saying we live a long way from you while actually you live near us you are now under a curse you will never cease to serve as woodcutters and water carriers for the house of my god they answered joshua your servants were clearly told how the lord your god had commanded his servant moses to give you the whole land and to wipe out all its inhabitants from before you so we feared for our lives because of you and that is why we did this we are now in your hands do to us whatever seems good and right to you so joshua saved them from the israelites and they did not kill them that day he made the gibeonites woodcutters and water carriers for the community and for the altar of the lord at the place the lord would choose and that is what they are to this day now adoni zedek king of jerusalem heard that joshua had taken ai and totally destroyed it doing to ai and its king as he had done to jericho and its king and that the people of gibeon had made a treaty of peace with israel and were living near them he and his people were very much alarmed at this because gibeon was an important city like one of the royal cities it was larger than ai and all its men were good fighters so adoni zedek king of jerusalem appealed to hoham king of hebron piram king of jarmuth japhia king of lachish and debir king of eglon come up and help me attack gibeon he said because it has made peace with joshua and the israelites then the five kings of the amorites the kings of jerusalem hebron jarmuth lachish and eglon joined forces they moved up with all their troops and took up positions against gibeon and attacked it the gibeonites then sent word to joshua in the camp at gilgal do not abandon your servants come up to us quickly and save us help us because all the amorite kings from the hill country have joined forces against us so joshua marched up from gilgal with his entire army including all the best fighting men the lord said to joshua do not be afraid of them i have given them into your hand not one of them will be able to withstand you after an all night march from gilgal joshua took them by surprise the lord threw them into confusion before israel who defeated them in a great victory at gibeon israel pursued them along the road going up to beth horon and cut them down all the way to azekah and makkedah as they fled before israel on the road down from beth horon to azekah the lord hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the israelites on the day the lord gave the amorites over to israel joshua said to the lord in the presence of israel o sun stand still over gibeon o moon over the valley of aijalon so the sun stood still and the moon stopped till the nation avenged itself on its enemies as it is written in the book of jashar the sun stopped in the middle of the sky and delayed going down about a full day there has never been a day like it before or since a day when the lord listened to a man surely the lord was fighting for israel then joshua returned with all israel to the camp at gilgal now the five kings had fled and hidden in the cave at makkedah when joshua was told that the five kings had been found hiding in the cave at makkedah he said roll large rocks up to the mouth of the cave and post some men there to guard it but dont stop pursue your enemies attack them from the rear and dont let them reach their cities for the lord your god has given them into your hand so joshua and the israelites destroyed them completely almost to a man but the few who were left reached their fortified cities the whole army then returned safely to joshua in the camp at makkedah and no one uttered a word against the israelites joshua said open the mouth of the cave and bring those five kings out to me so they brought the five kings out of the cave the kings of jerusalem hebron jarmuth lachish and eglon when they had brought these kings to joshua he summoned all the men of israel and said to the army commanders who had come with him come here and put your feet on the necks of these kings so they came forward and placed their feet on their necks joshua said to them do not be afraid do not be discouraged be strong and courageous this is what the lord will do to all the enemies you are going to fight then joshua struck and killed the kings and hung them on five trees and they were left hanging on the trees until evening at sunset joshua gave the order and they took them down from the trees and threw them into the cave where they had been hiding at the mouth of the cave they placed large rocks which are there to this day that day joshua took makkedah he put the city and its king to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it he left no survivors and he did to the king of makkedah as he had done to the king of jericho then joshua and all israel with him moved on from makkedah to libnah and attacked it the lord also gave that city and its king into israels hand the city and everyone in it joshua put to the sword he left no survivors there and he did to its king as he had done to the king of jericho then joshua and all israel with him moved on from libnah to lachish he took up positions against it and attacked it the lord handed lachish over to israel and joshua took it on the second day the city and everyone in it he put to the sword just as he had done to libnah meanwhile horam king of gezer had come up to help lachish but joshua defeated him and his army until no survivors were left then joshua and all israel with him moved on from lachish to eglon they took up positions against it and attacked it they captured it that same day and put it to the sword and totally destroyed everyone in it just as they had done to lachish then joshua and all israel with him went up from eglon to hebron and attacked it they took the city and put it to the sword together with its king its villages and everyone in it they left no survivors just as at eglon they totally destroyed it and everyone in it then joshua and all israel with him turned around and attacked debir they took the city its king and its villages and put them to the sword everyone in it they totally destroyed they left no survivors they did to debir and its king as they had done to libnah and its king and to hebron so joshua subdued the whole region including the hill country the negev the western foothills and the mountain slopes together with all their kings he left no survivors he totally destroyed all who breathed just as the lord the god of israel had commanded joshua subdued them from kadesh barnea to gaza and from the whole region of goshen to gibeon all these kings and their lands joshua conquered in one campaign because the lord the god of israel fought for israel then joshua returned with all israel to the camp at gilgal when jabin king of hazor heard of this he sent word to jobab king of madon to the kings of shimron and acshaph and to the northern kings who were in the mountains in the arabah south of kinnereth in the western foothills and in naphoth dor on the west to the canaanites in the east and west to the amorites hittites perizzites and jebusites in the hill country and to the hivites below hermon in the region of mizpah they came out with all their troops and a large number of horses and chariots a huge army as numerous as the sand on the seashore all these kings joined forces and made camp together at the waters of merom to fight against israel the lord said to joshua do not be afraid of them because by this time tomorrow i will hand all of them over to israel slain you are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots so joshua and his whole army came against them suddenly at the waters of merom and attacked them and the lord gave them into the hand of israel they defeated them and pursued them all the way to greater sidon to misrephoth maim and to the valley of mizpah on the east until no survivors were left joshua did to them as the lord had directed he hamstrung their horses and burned their chariots at that time joshua turned back and captured hazor and put its king to the sword hazor had been the head of all these kingdoms everyone in it they put to the sword they totally destroyed them not sparing anything that breathed and he burned up hazor itself joshua took all these royal cities and their kings and put them to the sword he totally destroyed them as moses the servant of the lord had commanded yet israel did not burn any of the cities built on their mounds except hazor which joshua burned the israelites carried off for themselves all the plunder and livestock of these cities but all the people they put to the sword until they completely destroyed them not sparing anyone that breathed as the lord commanded his servant moses so moses commanded joshua and joshua did it he left nothing undone of all that the lord commanded moses so joshua took this entire land the hill country all the negev the whole region of goshen the western foothills the arabah and the mountains of israel with their foothills from mount halak which rises toward seir to baal gad in the valley of lebanon below mount hermon he captured all their kings and struck them down putting them to death joshua waged war against all these kings for a long time except for the hivites living in gibeon not one city made a treaty of peace with the israelites who took them all in battle for it was the lord himself who hardened their hearts to wage war against israel so that he might destroy them totally exterminating them without mercy as the lord had commanded moses at that time joshua went and destroyed the anakites from the hill country from hebron debir and anab from all the hill country of judah and from all the hill country of israel joshua totally destroyed them and their towns no anakites were left in israelite territory only in gaza gath and ashdod did any survive so joshua took the entire land just as the lord had directed moses and he gave it as an inheritance to israel according to their tribal divisions then the land had rest from war these are the kings of the land whom the israelites had defeated and whose territory they took over east of the jordan from the arnon gorge to mount hermon including all the eastern side of the arabah sihon king of the amorites who reigned in heshbon he ruled from aroer on the rim of the arnon gorge from the middle of the

from baal gad below mount hermon to lebo hamath as for all the inhabitants of the mountain regions from lebanon to misrephoth maim that is all the sidonians i myself will drive them out before the israelites be sure to allocate this land to israel for an inheritance as i have instructed you and divide it as an inheritance among the nine tribes and half of the tribe of manasseh the other half of manasseh the reubenites and the gadites had received the inheritance that moses had given them east of the jordan as he the servant of the lord had assigned it to them it extended from aroer on the rim of the arnon gorge and from the town in the middle of the gorge and included the whole plateau of medeba as far as dibon and all the towns of sihon king of the amorites who ruled in heshbon out to the border of the ammonites it also included gilead the territory of the people of geshur and maacah all of mount hermon and all bashan as far as salecah that is the whole kingdom of og in bashan who had reigned in ashtaroth and edrei and had survived as one of the last of the rephaites moses had defeated them and taken over their land but the israelites did not drive out the people of geshur and maacah so they continue to live among the israelites to this day but to the tribe of levi he gave no inheritance since the offerings made by fire to the lord the god of israel are their inheritance as he promised them this is what moses had given to the tribe of reuben clan by clan the territory from aroer on the rim of the arnon gorge and from the town in the middle of the gorge and the whole plateau past medeba to heshbon and all its towns on the plateau including dibon bamoth baal beth baal meon jahaz kedemoth mephaath kiriathaim sibmah zereth shahar on the hill in the valley beth peor the slopes of pisgah and beth jeshimoth all the towns on the plateau and the entire realm of sihon king of the amorites who ruled at heshbon moses had defeated him and the midianite chiefs evi rekem zur hur and reba princes allied with sihon who lived in that country in addition to those slain in battle the israelites had put to the sword balaam son of beor who practiced divination the boundary of the reubenites was the bank of the jordan these towns and their villages were the inheritance of the reubenites clan by clan this is what moses had given to the tribe of gad clan by clan the territory of jazer all the towns of gilead and half the ammonite country as far as aroer near rabbah and from heshbon to ramath mizpah and betonim and from mahanaim to the territory of debir and in the valley beth haram beth nimrah succoth and zaphon with the rest of the realm of sihon king of heshbon the east side of the jordan the territory up to the end of the sea of kinnereth  these towns and their villages were the inheritance of the gadites clan by clan this is what moses had given to the half tribe of manasseh that is to half the family of the descendants of manasseh clan by clan the territory extending from mahanaim and including all of bashan the entire realm of og king of bashan all the settlements of jair in bashan sixty towns half of gilead and ashtaroth and edrei the royal cities of og in bashan this was for the descendants of makir son of manasseh for half of the sons of makir clan by clan this is the inheritance moses had given when he was in the plains of moab across the jordan east of jericho but to the tribe of levi moses had given no inheritance the lord the god of israel is their inheritance as he promised them now these are the areas the israelites received as an inheritance in the land of canaan which eleazar the priest joshua son of nun and the heads of the tribal clans of israel allotted to them their inheritances were assigned by lot to the nine and a half tribes as the lord had commanded through moses moses had granted the two and a half tribes their inheritance east of the jordan but had not granted the levites an inheritance among the rest for the sons of joseph had become two tribes manasseh and ephraim the levites received no share of the land but only towns to live in with pasturelands for their flocks and herds so the israelites divided the land just as the lord had commanded moses now the men of judah approached joshua at gilgal and caleb son of jephunneh the kenizzite said to him you know what the lord said to moses the man of god at kadesh barnea about you and me i was forty years old when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea to explore the land and i brought him back a report according to my convictions but my brothers who went up with me made the hearts of the people melt with fear i however followed the lord my god wholeheartedly so on that day moses swore to me the land on which your feet have walked will be your inheritance and that of your children forever because you have followed the lord my god wholeheartedly now then just as the lord promised he has kept me alive for forty five years since the time he said this to moses while israel moved about in the desert so here i am today eighty five years old i am still as strong today as the day moses sent me out im just as vigorous to go out to battle now as i was then now give me this hill country that the lord promised me that day you yourself heard then that the anakites were there and their cities were large and fortified but the lord helping me i will drive them out just as he said then joshua blessed caleb son of jephunneh and gave him hebron as his inheritance so hebron has belonged to caleb son of jephunneh the kenizzite ever since because he followed the lord the god of israel wholeheartedly hebron used to be called kiriath arba after arba who was the greatest man among the anakites then the

anakites sheshai ahiman and talmai descendants of anak from there he marched against the people living in debir formerly called kiriath sepher and caleb said i will give my daughter acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures kiriath sepher othniel son of kenaz calebs brother took it so caleb gave his daughter acsah to him in marriage one day when she came to othniel she urged him to ask her father for a field when she got off her donkey caleb asked her what can i do for you she replied do me a special favor since you have given me land in the negev give me also springs of water so

manassehs firstborn makir was the ancestor of the gileadites who had received gilead and bashan because the makirites were great soldiers so this allotment was for the rest of the people of manasseh the clans of abiezer helek asriel shechem hepher and shemida these are the other male descendants of manasseh son of joseph by their clans now zelophehad son of hepher the son of gilead the son of makir the son of manasseh had no sons but only daughters whose names were mahlah noah hoglah milcah and tirzah they went to eleazar the priest joshua son of nun and the leaders and said the lord commanded moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers so joshua gave them an inheritance along with the brothers of their father according to the lords command manassehs share consisted of ten tracts of land besides gilead and bashan east of the jordan because the daughters of the tribe of manasseh received an inheritance among the sons the land of gilead belonged to the rest of the descendants of manasseh the territory of manasseh extended from asher to micmethath east of shechem the boundary ran southward from there to include the people living at en tappuah manasseh had the land of tappuah but tappuah itself on the boundary of manasseh belonged to the ephraimites then the boundary continued south to the kanah ravine there were towns belonging to ephraim lying among the

their surrounding settlements the third in the list is naphoth  yet the manassites were not able to occupy these towns for the canaanites were determined to live in that region however when the israelites grew stronger they subjected the canaanites to forced labor but did not drive them out completely the people of joseph said to joshua why have you given us only one allotment and one portion for an inheritance we are a numerous people and the lord has blessed us abundantly if you are so numerous joshua answered and if the hill country of ephraim is too small for you go up into the forest and clear land for yourselves there in the land of the perizzites and rephaites the people of joseph replied the hill country is not enough for us and all the canaanites who live in the plain have iron chariots both those in beth shan and its settlements and those in the valley of jezreel but joshua said to the house of joseph to ephraim and manasseh you are numerous and very powerful you will have not only one allotment but the forested hill country as well clear it and its farthest limits will be yours though the canaanites have iron chariots and though they are strong you can drive them out the whole assembly of the israelites gathered at shiloh and set up the tent of meeting there the country was brought under their control but there were still seven israelite tribes who had not yet received their inheritance so joshua said to the israelites how long will you wait before you begin to take possession of the land that the lord the god of your fathers has given you appoint three men from each tribe i will send them out to make a survey of the land and to write a description of it according to the inheritance of each then they will return to me you are to divide the land into seven parts judah is to remain in its territory on the south and the house of joseph in its territory on the north after you have written descriptions of the seven parts of the land bring them here to me and i will cast lots for you in the presence of the lord our god the levites however do not get a portion among you because the priestly service of the lord is their inheritance and gad reuben and the half tribe of manasseh have already received their inheritance on the east side of the jordan moses the servant of the lord gave it to them as the men started on their way to map out the land joshua instructed them go and make a survey of the land and write a description of it then return to me and i will cast lots for you here at shiloh in the presence of the lord so the men left and went through the land they wrote its description on a scroll town by town in seven parts and returned to joshua in the camp at shiloh joshua then cast lots for them in shiloh in the presence of the lord and there he distributed the land to the israelites according to their tribal divisions the lot came up for the tribe of benjamin clan by clan their allotted territory lay between the tribes

heleph and the large tree in zaanannim passing adami nekeb and jabneel to lakkum and ending at the jordan the boundary ran west through aznoth tabor and came out at hukkok it touched zebulun on the south asher on the west and the jordan on the east the fortified cities were ziddim zer hammath rakkath kinnereth adamah ramah hazor kedesh edrei en hazor iron migdal el horem beth anath and beth shemesh there were nineteen towns and their villages these towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of naphtali clan by clan the seventh lot came out for the tribe of dan clan by clan the territory of their inheritance included zorah eshtaol ir shemesh shaalabbin aijalon ithlah elon timnah ekron eltekeh gibbethon baalath jehud bene berak gath rimmon me jarkon and rakkon with the area facing joppa but the danites had difficulty taking possession of their territory so they went up and attacked leshem took it put it to the sword and occupied it they settled in leshem and named it dan after their forefather these towns and their villages were the inheritance of the tribe of dan clan by clan when they had finished dividing the land into its allotted portions the israelites gave joshua son of nun an inheritance among them as the lord had commanded they gave him the town he asked for timnath serah in the hill country of ephraim and he built up the town and settled there these are the territories that eleazar the priest joshua son of nun and the heads of the tribal clans of israel assigned by lot at shiloh in the presence of the lord at the entrance to the tent of meeting and so they finished dividing the land then the lord said to joshua tell the israelites to designate the cities of refuge as i instructed you through moses so that anyone who kills a person accidentally and unintentionally may flee there and find protection from the avenger of blood when he flees to one of these cities he is to stand in the entrance of the city gate and state his case before the elders of that city then they are to admit him into their city and give him a place to live with them if the avenger of blood pursues him they must not surrender the one accused because he killed his neighbor unintentionally and without malice aforethought he is to stay in that city until he has stood trial before the assembly and until the death of the high priest who is serving at that time then he may go back to his own home in the town from which he fled so they set apart kedesh in galilee in the hill country of naphtali shechem in the hill country of ephraim and kiriath arba that is hebron in the hill country of judah on the east side of the jordan of jericho they designated bezer in the desert on the plateau in the tribe of reuben ramoth in gilead in the tribe of gad and golan in bashan in the tribe of manasseh any of the israelites or any alien living among them who killed someone accidentally could flee to these designated cities and not be killed by the avenger of blood prior to standing trial before the assembly now the family heads of the levites approached eleazar the priest joshua son of nun and the heads of the other tribal families of israel at shiloh in canaan and said to them the lord commanded through moses that you give us towns to live in with pasturelands for our livestock so as the lord had commanded the israelites gave the levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own inheritance the first lot came out for the kohathites clan by clan the levites who were descendants of aaron the priest were allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of judah simeon and benjamin the rest of kohaths descendants were allotted ten towns from the clans of the tribes of ephraim dan and half of manasseh the descendants of gershon were allotted thirteen towns from the clans of the tribes of issachar asher naphtali and the half tribe of manasseh in bashan the descendants of merari clan by clan received twelve towns from the tribes of reuben gad and zebulun so the israelites allotted to the levites these towns and their pasturelands as the lord had commanded through moses from the tribes of judah and simeon they allotted the following towns by name these towns were assigned to the descendants of aaron who were from the kohathite clans of the levites because the first lot fell to them they gave them kiriath arba that is hebron with its surrounding pastureland in the hill country of judah arba was the forefather of anak but the fields and villages around the city they had given to caleb son of jephunneh as his possession so to the descendants of aaron the priest they gave hebron a city of refuge for one accused of murder libnah jattir eshtemoa holon debir ain juttah and beth shemesh together with their pasturelands nine towns from these two tribes and from the tribe of benjamin they gave them gibeon geba anathoth and almon together with their pasturelands four towns all the towns for the priests the descendants of aaron were thirteen together with their pasturelands the rest of the kohathite clans of the levites were allotted towns from the tribe of ephraim in the hill country of ephraim they were given shechem a city of refuge for one accused of murder and gezer kibzaim and beth horon together with their pasturelands four towns also from the tribe of dan they received eltekeh gibbethon aijalon and gath rimmon together with their pasturelands four towns from half the tribe of manasseh they received taanach and gath rimmon together with their pasturelands two towns all these ten towns and their pasturelands were given to the rest of the kohathite clans the levite clans of the gershonites were given from the half tribe of manasseh golan in bashan a city of refuge for one accused of murder and be eshtarah together with their pasturelands two towns from the tribe of issachar kishion daberath jarmuth and en gannim together with their pasturelands four towns from the tribe of asher mishal abdon helkath and rehob together with their pasturelands four towns from the tribe of naphtali kedesh in galilee a city of refuge for one accused of murder hammoth dor and kartan together with their pasturelands three towns all the towns of the gershonite clans were thirteen together with their pasturelands the merarite clans the rest of the levites were given from the tribe of zebulun jokneam kartah dimnah and nahalal together with their pasturelands four towns from the tribe of reuben bezer jahaz kedemoth and mephaath together with their pasturelands four towns from the tribe of gad ramoth in gilead a city of refuge for one accused of murder mahanaim heshbon and jazer together with their pasturelands four towns in all all the towns allotted to the merarite clans who were the rest of the levites were twelve the towns of the levites in the territory held by the israelites were forty eight in all together with their pasturelands each of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it this was true for all these towns so the lord gave israel all the land he had sworn to give their forefathers and they took possession of it and settled there the lord gave them rest on every side just as he had sworn to their forefathers not one of their enemies withstood them the lord handed all their enemies over to them not one of all the lords good promises to the house of israel failed every one was fulfilled then joshua summoned the reubenites the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh and said to them you have done all that moses the servant of the lord commanded and you have obeyed me in everything i commanded for a long time now to this very day you have not deserted your brothers but have carried out the mission the lord your god gave you now that the lord your god has given your brothers rest as he promised return to your homes in the land that moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side of the jordan but be very careful to keep the commandment and the law that moses the servant of the lord gave you to love the lord your god to walk in all his ways to obey his commands to hold fast to him and to serve him with all your heart and all your soul then joshua blessed them and sent them away and they went to their homes to the half tribe of manasseh moses had given land in bashan and to the other half of the tribe joshua gave land on the west side of the jordan with their brothers when joshua sent them home he blessed them saying return to your homes with your great wealth with large herds of livestock with silver gold bronze and iron and a great quantity of clothing and divide with your brothers the plunder from your enemies so the reubenites the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh left the israelites at shiloh in canaan to return to gilead their own land which they had acquired in accordance with the command of the lord through moses when they came to geliloth near the jordan in the land of canaan the reubenites the gadites and the half tribe of manasseh built an imposing altar there by the jordan and when the israelites heard that they had built the altar on the border of canaan at geliloth near the jordan on the israelite side the whole assembly of israel gathered at shiloh to go to war against them so the israelites sent phinehas son of eleazar the priest to the land of gilead to reuben gad and the half tribe of manasseh with him they sent ten of the chief men one for each of the tribes of israel each the head of a family division among the israelite clans when they went to gilead to reuben gad and the half tribe of manasseh they said to them the whole assembly of the lord says how could you break faith with the god of israel like this how could you turn away from the lord and build yourselves an altar in rebellion against him now was not the sin of peor enough for us up to this very day we have not cleansed ourselves from that sin even though a plague fell on the community of the lord and are you now turning away from the lord if you rebel against the lord today tomorrow he will be angry with the whole community of israel if the land you possess is defiled come over to the lords land where the lords tabernacle stands and share the land with us but do not rebel against the lord or against us by building an altar for yourselves other than the altar of the lord our god when achan son of zerah acted unfaithfully regarding the devoted things did not wrath come upon the whole community of israel he was not the only one who died for his sin then reuben gad and the half tribe of manasseh replied to the heads of the clans of israel the mighty one god the lord the mighty one god the lord he knows and let israel know if this has been in rebellion or disobedience to the lord do not spare us this day if we have built our own altar to turn away from the lord and to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings or to sacrifice fellowship offerings on it may the lord himself call us to account no we did it for fear that some day your descendants might say to ours what do you have to do with the lord the god of israel the lord has made the jordan a boundary between us and you you reubenites and gadites you have no share in the lord so your descendants might cause ours to stop fearing the lord that is why we said let us get ready and build an altar but not for burnt offerings or sacrifices on the contrary it is to be a witness between us and you and the generations that follow that we will worship the lord at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings sacrifices and fellowship offerings then in the future your descendants will not be able to say to ours you have no share in the lord and we said if they ever say this to us or to our descendants we will answer look at the replica of the lords altar which our fathers built not for burnt offerings and sacrifices but as a witness between us and you far be it from us to rebel against the lord and turn away from him today by building an altar for burnt offerings grain offerings and sacrifices other than the altar of the lord our god that stands before his tabernacle when phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community the heads of the clans of the israelites heard what reuben gad and manasseh had to say they were pleased and phinehas son of eleazar the priest said to reuben gad and manasseh today we know that the lord is with us because you have not acted unfaithfully toward the lord in this matter now you have rescued the israelites from the lords hand then phinehas son of eleazar the priest and the leaders returned to canaan from their meeting with the reubenites and gadites in gilead and reported to the israelites they were glad to hear the report and praised god and they talked no more about going to war against them to devastate the country where the reubenites and the gadites lived and the reubenites and the gadites gave the altar this name a witness between us that the lord is god after a long time had passed and the lord had given israel rest from all their enemies around them joshua by then old and well advanced in years summoned all israel their elders leaders judges and officials and said to them i am old and well advanced in years you yourselves have seen everything the lord your god has done to all these nations for your sake it was the lord your god who fought for you remember how i have allotted as an inheritance for your tribes all the land of the nations that remain the nations i conquered between the jordan and the great sea in the west the lord your god himself will drive them out of your way he will push them out before you and you will take possession of their land as the lord your god promised you be very strong be careful to obey all that is written in the book of the law of moses without turning aside to the right or to the left do not associate with these nations that remain among you do not invoke the names of their gods or swear by them you must not serve them or bow down to them but you are to hold fast to the lord your god as you have until now the lord has driven out before you great and powerful nations to this day no one has been able to withstand you one of you routs a thousand because the lord your god fights for you just as he promised so be very careful to love the lord your god but if you turn away and ally yourselves with the survivors of these nations that remain among you and if you intermarry with them and associate with them then you may be sure that the lord your god will no longer drive out these nations before you instead they will become snares and traps for you whips on your backs and thorns in your eyes until you perish from this good land which the lord your god has given you now i am about to go the way of all the earth you know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the lord your god gave you has failed every promise has been fulfilled not one has failed but just as every good promise of the lord your god has come true so the lord will bring on you all the evil he has threatened until he has destroyed you from this good land he has given you if you violate the covenant of the lord your god which he commanded you and go and serve other gods and bow down to them the lords anger will burn against you and you will quickly perish from the good land he has given you then joshua assembled all the tribes of israel at shechem he summoned the elders leaders judges and officials of israel and they presented themselves before god joshua said to all the people this is what the lord the god of israel says long ago your forefathers including terah the father of abraham and nahor lived beyond the river and worshiped other gods but i took your father abraham from the land beyond the river and led him throughout canaan and gave him many descendants i gave him isaac and to isaac i gave jacob and esau i assigned the hill country of seir to esau but jacob and his sons went down to egypt then i sent moses and aaron and i afflicted the egyptians by what i did there and i brought you out when i brought your fathers out of egypt you came to the sea and the egyptians pursued them with chariots and horsemen as far as the red sea but they cried to the lord for help and he put darkness between you and the egyptians he brought the sea over them and covered them you saw with your own eyes what i did to the egyptians then you lived in the desert for a long time i brought you to the land of the amorites who lived east of the jordan they fought against you but i gave them into your hands i destroyed them from before you and you took possession of their land when balak son of zippor the king of moab prepared to fight against israel he sent for balaam son of beor to put a curse on you but i would not listen to balaam so he blessed you again and again and i delivered you out of his hand then you crossed the jordan and came to jericho the citizens of jericho fought against you as did also the amorites perizzites canaanites hittites girgashites hivites and jebusites but i gave them into your hands i sent the hornet ahead of you which drove them out before you also the two amorite kings you did not do it with your own sword and bow so i gave you a land on which you did not toil and cities you did not build and you live in them and eat from vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant now fear the lord and serve him with all faithfulness throw away the gods your forefathers worshiped beyond the river and in egypt and serve the lord but if serving the lord seems undesirable to you then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve whether the gods your forefathers served beyond the river or the gods of the amorites in whose land you are living but as for me and my household we will serve the lord then the people answered far be it from us to forsake the lord to serve other gods it was the lord our god himself who brought us and our fathers up out of egypt from that land of slavery and performed those great signs before our eyes he protected us on our entire journey and among all the nations through which we traveled and the lord drove out before us all the nations including the amorites who lived in the land we too will serve the lord because he is our god joshua said to the people you are not able to serve the lord he is a holy god he is a jealous god he will not forgive your rebellion and your sins if you forsake the lord and serve foreign gods he will turn and bring disaster on you and make an end of you after he has been good to you but the people said to joshua no we will serve the lord then joshua said you are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen to serve the lordyes we are witnesses they replied now then said joshua throw away the foreign gods that are among you and yield your hearts to the lord the god of israel and the people said to joshua we will serve the lord our god and obey him on that day joshua made a covenant for the people and there at shechem he drew up for them decrees and laws and joshua recorded these things in the book of the law of god then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak near the holy place of the lord see he said to all the people this stone will be a witness against us it has heard all the words the lord has said to us it will be a witness against you if you are untrue to your god then joshua sent the people away each to his own inheritance after these things joshua son of nun the servant of the lord died at the age of a hundred and ten and they buried him in the land of his inheritance at timnath serah in the hill country of ephraim north of mount gaash israel served the lord throughout the lifetime of joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had experienced everything the lord had done for israel and josephs bones which the israelites had brought up from egypt were buried at shechem in the tract of land that jacob bought for a hundred pieces of silver from the sons of hamor the father of shechem this became the inheritance of josephs descendants and eleazar son of aaron died and was buried at gibeah which had been allotted to his son phinehas in the hill country of ephraim  after the death of joshua the israelites asked the lord who will be the first to go up and fight for us against the canaanites the lord answered judah is to go i have given the land into their hands then the men of judah said to the simeonites their brothers come up with us into the territory allotted to us to fight against the canaanites we in turn will go with you into yours so the simeonites went with them when judah attacked the lord gave the canaanites and perizzites into their hands and they struck down ten thousand men at bezek it was there that they found adoni bezek and fought against him putting to rout the canaanites and perizzites adoni bezek fled but they chased him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes then adoni bezek said seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table now god has paid me back for what i did to them they brought him to jerusalem and he died there the men of judah attacked jerusalem also and took it they put the city to the sword and set it on fire after that the men of judah went down to fight against the canaanites living in the hill country the negev and the western foothills they advanced against the canaanites living in hebron formerly called kiriath arba and defeated sheshai ahiman and talmai from there they advanced against the people living in debir formerly called kiriath sepher and caleb said i will give my daughter acsah in marriage to the man who attacks and captures kiriath sepher othniel son of kenaz calebs younger brother took it so caleb gave his daughter acsah to him in marriage one day when she came to othniel she urged him to ask her father for a field when she got off her donkey caleb asked her what can i do for you she replied do me a special favor since you have given me land in the negev give me also springs of water then caleb gave her the upper and lower springs the descendants of moses father in law the kenite went up from the city of palms with the men of judah to live among the people of the desert of judah in the negev near arad then the men of judah went with the simeonites their brothers and attacked the canaanites living in zephath and they totally destroyed the city therefore it was called hormah the men of judah also took gaza ashkelon and ekron each city with its territory the lord was with the men of judah they took possession of the hill country but they were unable to drive the people from the plains because they had iron chariots as moses had promised hebron was given to caleb who drove from it the three sons of anak the benjamites however failed to dislodge the jebusites who were living in jerusalem to this day the jebusites live there with the benjamites now the house of joseph attacked bethel and the lord was with them when they sent men to spy out bethel formerly called luz the spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him show us how to get into the city and we will see that you are treated well so he showed them and they put the city to the sword but spared the man and his whole family he then went to the land of the hittites where he built a city and called it luz which is its name to this day but manasseh did not drive out the people of beth shan or taanach or dor or ibleam or megiddo and their surrounding settlements for the canaanites were determined to live in that land when israel became strong they pressed the canaanites into forced labor but never drove them out completely nor did ephraim drive out the canaanites living in gezer but the canaanites continued to live there among them neither did zebulun drive out the canaanites living in kitron or nahalol who remained among them but they did subject them to forced labor nor did asher drive out those living in acco or sidon or ahlab or aczib or helbah or aphek or rehob and because of this the people of asher lived among the canaanite inhabitants of the land neither did naphtali drive out those living in beth shemesh or beth anath but the naphtalites too lived among the canaanite inhabitants of the land and those living in beth shemesh and beth anath became forced laborers for them the amorites confined the danites to the hill country not allowing them to come down into the plain and the amorites were determined also to hold out in mount heres aijalon and shaalbim but when the power of the house of joseph increased they too were pressed into forced labor the boundary of the amorites was from scorpion pass to sela and beyond the angel of the lord went up from gilgal to bokim and said i brought you up out of egypt and led you into the land that i swore to give to your forefathers i said i will never break my covenant with you and you shall not make a covenant with the people of this land but you shall break down their altars yet you have disobeyed me why have you done this now therefore i tell you that i will not drive them out before you they will be thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you when the angel of the lord had spoken these things to all the israelites the people wept aloud and they called that place bokim there they offered sacrifices to the lord after joshua had dismissed the israelites they went to take possession of the land each to his own inheritance the people served the lord throughout the lifetime of joshua and of the elders who outlived him and who had seen all the great things the lord had done for israel joshua son of nun the servant of the lord died at the age of a hundred and ten and they buried him in the land of his inheritance at timnath heres in the hill country of ephraim north of mount gaash after that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers another generation grew up who knew neither the lord nor what he had done for israel then the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord and served the baals they forsook the lord the god of their fathers who had brought them out of egypt they followed and worshiped various gods of the peoples around them they provoked the lord to anger because they forsook him and served baal and the ashtoreths in his anger against israel the lord handed them over to raiders who plundered them he sold them to their enemies all around whom they were no longer able to resist whenever israel went out to fight the hand of the lord was against them to defeat them just as he had sworn to them they were in great distress then the lord raised up judges who saved them out of the hands of these raiders yet they would not listen to their judges but prostituted themselves to other gods and worshiped them unlike their fathers they quickly turned from the way in which their fathers had walked the way of obedience to the lord s commands whenever the lord raised up a judge for them he was with the judge and saved them out of the hands of their enemies as long as the judge lived for the lord had compassion on them as they groaned under those who oppressed and afflicted them but when the judge died the people returned to ways even more corrupt than those of their fathers following other gods and serving and worshiping them they refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways therefore the lord was very angry with israel and said because this nation has violated the covenant that i laid down for their forefathers and has not listened to me i will no longer drive out before them any of the nations joshua left when he died i will use them to test israel and see whether they will keep the way of the lord and walk in it as their forefathers did the lord had allowed those nations to remain he did not drive them out at once by giving them into the hands of joshua these are the nations the lord left to test all those israelites who had not experienced any of the wars in canaan he did this only to teach warfare to the descendants of the israelites who had not had previous battle experience the five rulers of the philistines all the canaanites the sidonians and the hivites living in the lebanon mountains from mount baal hermon to lebo hamath they were left to test the israelites to see whether they would obey the lord s commands which he had given their forefathers through moses the israelites lived among the canaanites hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites they took their daughters in marriage and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord they forgot the lord their god and served the baals and the asherahs the anger of the lord burned against israel so that he sold them into the hands of cushan rishathaim king of aram naharaim to whom the israelites were subject for eight years but when they cried out to the lord he raised up for them a deliverer othniel son of kenaz calebs younger brother who saved them the spirit of the lord came upon him so that he became israels judge and went to war the lord gave cushan rishathaim king of aram into the hands of othniel who overpowered him so the land had peace for forty years until othniel son of kenaz died once again the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord and because they did this evil the lord gave eglon king of moab power over israel getting the ammonites and amalekites to join him eglon came and attacked israel and they took possession of the city of palms the israelites were subject to eglon king of moab for eighteen years again the israelites cried out to the lord and he gave them a deliverer ehud a left handed man the son of gera the benjamite the israelites sent him with tribute to eglon king of moab now ehud had made a double edged sword about a foot and a half long which he strapped to his right thigh under his clothing he presented the tribute to eglon king of moab who was a very fat man after ehud had presented the tribute he sent on their way the men who had carried it at the idols near gilgal he himself turned back and said i have a secret message for you o king the king said quiet and all his attendants left him ehud then approached him while he was sitting alone in the upper room of his summer palace and said i have a message from god for you as the king rose from his seat ehud reached with his left hand drew the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into the kings belly even the handle sank in after the blade which came out his back ehud did not pull the sword out and the fat closed in over it then ehud went out to the porch he shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them after he had gone the servants came and found the doors of the upper room locked they said he must be relieving himself in the inner room of the house they waited to the point of embarrassment but when he did not open the doors of the room they took a key and unlocked them there they saw their lord fallen to the floor dead while they waited ehud got away he passed by the idols and escaped to seirah when he arrived there he blew a trumpet in the hill country of ephraim and the israelites went down with him from the hills with him leading them follow me he ordered for the lord has given moab your enemy into your hands so they followed him down and taking possession of the fords of the jordan that led to moab they allowed no one to cross over at that time they struck down about ten thousand moabites all vigorous and strong not a man escaped that day moab was made subject to israel and the land had peace for eighty years after ehud came shamgar son of anath who struck down six hundred philistines with an oxgoad he too saved israel after ehud died the israelites once again did evil in the eyes of the lord so the lord sold them into the hands of jabin a king of canaan who reigned in hazor the commander of his army was sisera who lived in harosheth haggoyim because he had nine hundred iron chariots and had cruelly oppressed the israelites for twenty years they cried to the lord for help deborah a prophetess the wife of lappidoth was leading israel at that time she held court under the palm of deborah between ramah and bethel in the hill country of ephraim and the israelites came to her to have their disputes decided she sent for barak son of abinoam from kedesh in naphtali and said to him the lord the god of israel commands you go take with you ten thousand men of naphtali and zebulun and lead the way to mount tabor i will lure sisera the commander of jabins army with his chariots and his troops to the kishon river and give him into your hands barak said to her if you go with me i will go but if you dont go with me i wont go very well deborah said i will go with you but because of the way you are going about this the honor will not be yours for the lord will hand sisera over to a woman so deborah went with barak to kedesh where he summoned zebulun and naphtali ten thousand men followed him and deborah also went with him now heber the kenite had left the other kenites the descendants of hobab moses brother in law and pitched his tent by the great tree in zaanannim near kedesh when they told sisera that barak son of abinoam had gone up to mount tabor sisera gathered together his nine hundred iron chariots and all the men with him from harosheth haggoyim to the kishon river then deborah said to barak go this is the day the lord has given sisera into your hands has not the lord gone ahead of you so barak went down mount tabor followed by ten thousand men at baraks advance the lord routed sisera and all his chariots and army by the sword and sisera abandoned his chariot and fled on foot but barak pursued the chariots and army as far as harosheth haggoyim all the troops of sisera fell by the sword not a man was left sisera however fled on foot to the tent of jael the wife of heber the kenite because there were friendly relations between jabin king of hazor and the clan of heber the kenite jael went out to meet sisera and said to him come my lord come right in dont be afraid so he entered her tent and she put a covering over him im thirsty he said please give me some water she opened a skin of milk gave him a drink and covered him up stand in the doorway of the tent he told her if someone comes by and asks you is anyone here say no but jael hebers wife picked up a tent peg and a hammer and went quietly to him while he lay fast asleep exhausted she drove the peg through his temple into the ground and he died barak came by in pursuit of sisera and jael went out to meet him come she said i will show you the man youre looking for so he went in with her and there lay sisera with the tent peg through his temple dead on that day god subdued jabin the canaanite king before the israelites and the hand of the israelites grew stronger and stronger against jabin the canaanite king until they destroyed him on that day deborah and barak son of abinoam sang this song when the princes in israel take the lead when the people willingly offer themselves praise the lord hear this you kings listen you rulers i will sing to the lord i will sing i will make music to the lord the god of israel o lord when you went out from seir when you marched from the land of edom the earth shook the heavens poured the clouds poured down water the mountains quaked before the lord the one of sinai before the lord the god of israel in the days of shamgar son of anath in the days of jael the roads were abandoned travelers took to winding paths village life in israel ceased ceased until i deborah arose arose a mother in israel when they chose new gods war came to the city gates and not a shield or spear was seen among forty thousand in israel my heart is with israels princes with the willing volunteers among the people praise the lord you who ride on white donkeys sitting on your saddle blankets and you who walk along the road consider the voice of the singers at the watering places they recite the righteous acts of the lord the righteous acts of his warriors in israel then the people of the lord went down to the city gates wake up wake up deborah wake up wake up break out in song arise o barak take captive your captives o son of abinoam then the men who were left came down to the nobles the people of the lord came to me with the mighty some came from ephraim whose roots were in amalek benjamin was with the people who followed you from makir captains came down from zebulun those who bear a commanders staff the princes of issachar were with deborah yes issachar was with barak rushing after him into the valley in the districts of reuben there was much searching of heart why did you stay among the campfires to hear the whistling for the flocks in the districts of reuben there was much searching of heart gilead stayed beyond the jordan and dan why did he linger by the ships asher remained on the coast and stayed in his coves the people of zebulun risked their very lives so did naphtali on the heights of the field kings came they fought the kings of canaan fought at taanach by the waters of megiddo but they carried off no silver no plunder from the heavens the stars fought from their courses they fought against sisera the river kishon swept them away the age old river the river kishon march on my soul be strong then thundered the horses hoofs galloping galloping go his mighty steeds curse meroz said the angel of the lord curse its people bitterly because they did not come to help the lord to help the lord against the mighty most blessed of women be jael the wife of heber the kenite most blessed of tent dwelling women he asked for water and she gave him milk in a bowl fit for nobles she brought him curdled milk her hand reached for the tent peg her right hand for the workmans hammer she struck sisera she crushed his head she shattered and pierced his temple at her feet he sank he fell there he lay at her feet he sank he fell where he sank there he fell dead through the window peered siseras mother behind the lattice she cried out why is his chariot so long in coming why is the clatter of his chariots delayed the wisest of her ladies answer her indeed she keeps saying to herself are they not finding and dividing the spoils a girl or two for each man colorful garments as plunder for sisera colorful garments embroidered highly embroidered garments for my neck all this as plunder so may all your enemies perish o lord but may they who love you be like the sun when it rises in its strength then the land had peace forty years again the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord and for seven years he gave them into the hands of the midianites because the power of midian was so oppressive the israelites prepared shelters for themselves in mountain clefts caves and strongholds whenever the israelites planted their crops the midianites amalekites and other eastern peoples invaded the country they camped on the land and ruined the crops all the way to gaza and did not spare a living thing for israel neither sheep nor cattle nor donkeys they came up with their livestock and their tents like swarms of locusts it was impossible to count the men and their camels they invaded the land to ravage it midian so impoverished the israelites that they cried out to the lord for help when the israelites cried to the lord because of midian he sent them a prophet who said this is what the lord the god of israel says i brought you up out of egypt out of the land of slavery i snatched you from the power of egypt and from the hand of all your oppressors i drove them from before you and gave you their land i said to you i am the lord your god do not worship the gods of the amorites in whose land you live but you have not listened to me the angel of the lord came and sat down under the oak in ophrah that belonged to joash the abiezrite where his son gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to keep it from the midianites when the angel of the lord appeared to gideon he said the lord is with you mighty warrior but sir gideon replied if the lord is with us why has all this happened to us where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said did not the lord bring us up out of egypt but now the lord has abandoned us and put us into the hand of midian the lord turned to him and said go in the strength you have and save israel out of midians hand am i not sending you but lord gideon asked how can i save israel my clan is the weakest in manasseh and i am the least in my family the lord answered i will be with you and you will strike down all the midianites together gideon replied if now i have found favor in your eyes give me a sign that it is really you talking to me please do not go away until i come back and bring my offering and set it before you and the lord said i will wait until you return gideon went in prepared a young goat and from an ephah of flour he made bread without yeast putting the meat in a basket and its broth in a pot he brought them out and offered them to him under the oak the angel of god said to him take the meat and the unleavened bread place them on this rock and pour out the broth and gideon did so with the tip of the staff that was in his hand the angel of the lord touched the meat and the unleavened bread fire flared from the rock consuming the meat and the bread and the angel of the lord disappeared when gideon realized that it was the angel of the lord he exclaimed ah sovereign lord i have seen the angel of the lord face to face but the lord said to him peace do not be afraid you are not going to die so gideon built an altar to the lord there and called it the lord is peace to this day it stands in ophrah of the abiezrites that same night the lord said to him take the second bull from your fathers herd the one seven years old tear down your fathers altar to baal and cut down the asherah pole beside it then build a proper kind of altar to the lord your god on the top of this height using the wood of the asherah pole that you cut down offer the second bull as a burnt offering so gideon took ten of his servants and did as the lord told him but because he was afraid of his family and the men of the town he did it at night rather than in the daytime in the morning when the men of the town got up there was baals altar demolished with the asherah pole beside it cut down and the second bull sacrificed on the newly built altar they asked each other who did this when they carefully investigated they were told gideon son of joash did it the men of the town demanded of joash bring out your son he must die because he has broken down baals altar and cut down the asherah pole beside it but joash replied to the hostile crowd around him are you going to plead baals cause are you trying to save him whoever fights for him shall be put to death by morning if baal really is a god he can defend himself when someone breaks down his altar so that day they called gideon jerub baal saying let baal contend with him because he broke down baals altar now all the midianites amalekites and other eastern peoples joined forces and crossed over the jordan and camped in the valley of jezreel then the spirit of the lord came upon gideon and he blew a trumpet summoning the abiezrites to follow him he sent messengers throughout manasseh calling them to arms and also into asher zebulun and naphtali so that they too went up to meet them gideon said to god if you will save israel by my hand as you have promised look i will place a wool fleece on the threshing floor if there is dew only on the fleece and all the ground is dry then i will know that you will save israel by my hand as you said and that is what happened gideon rose early the next day he squeezed the fleece and wrung out the dew a bowlful of water then gideon said to god do not be angry with me let me make just one more request allow me one more test with the fleece this time make the fleece dry and the ground covered with dew that night god did so only the fleece was dry all the ground was covered with dew early in the morning jerub baal that is gideon and all his men camped at the spring of harod the camp of midian was north of them in the valley near the hill of moreh the lord said to gideon you have too many men for me to deliver midian into their hands in order that israel may not boast against me that her own strength has saved her announce now to the people anyone who trembles with fear may turn back and leave mount gilead so twenty two thousand men left while ten thousand remained but the lord said to gideon there are still too many men take them down to the water and i will sift them for you there if i say this one shall go with you he shall go but if i say this one shall not go with you he shall not go so gideon took the men down to the water there the lord told him separate those who lap the water with their tongues like a dog from those who kneel down to drink three hundred men lapped with their hands to their mouths all the rest got down on their knees to drink the lord said to gideon with the three hundred men that lapped i will save you and give the midianites into your hands let all the other men go each to his own place so gideon sent the rest of the israelites to their tents but kept the three hundred who took over the provisions and trumpets of the others now the camp of midian lay below him in the valley during that night the lord said to gideon get up go down against the camp because i am going to give it into your hands if you are afraid to attack go down to the camp with your servant purah and listen to what they are saying afterward you will be encouraged to attack the camp so he and purah his servant went down to the outposts of the camp the midianites the amalekites and all the other eastern peoples had settled in the valley thick as locusts their camels could no more be counted than the sand on the seashore gideon arrived just as a man was telling a friend his dream i had a dream he was saying a round loaf of barley bread came tumbling into the midianite camp it struck the tent with such force that the tent overturned and collapsed his friend responded this can be nothing other than the sword of gideon son of joash the israelite god has given the midianites and the whole camp into his hands when gideon heard the dream and its interpretation he worshiped god he returned to the camp of israel and called out get up the lord has given the midianite camp into your hands dividing the three hundred men into three companies he placed trumpets and empty jars in the hands of all of them with torches inside watch me he told them follow my lead when i get to the edge of the camp do exactly as i do when i and all who are with me blow our trumpets then from all around the camp blow yours and shout for the lord and for gideon gideon and the hundred men with him reached the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch just after they had changed the guard they blew their trumpets and broke the jars that were in their hands the three companies blew the trumpets and smashed the jars grasping the torches in their left hands and holding in their right hands the trumpets they were to blow they shouted a sword for the lord and for gideon while each man held his position around the camp all the midianites ran crying out as they fled when the three hundred trumpets sounded the lord caused the men throughout the camp to turn on each other with their swords the army fled to beth shittah toward zererah as far as the border of abel meholah near tabbath israelites from naphtali asher and all manasseh were called out and they pursued the midianites gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of ephraim saying come down against the midianites and seize the waters of the jordan ahead of them as far as beth barah so all the men of ephraim were called out and they took the waters of the jordan as far as beth barah they also captured two of the midianite leaders oreb and zeeb they killed oreb at the rock of oreb and zeeb at the winepress of zeeb they pursued the midianites and brought the heads of oreb and zeeb to gideon who was by the jordan now the ephraimites asked gideon why have you treated us like this why didnt you call us when you went to fight midian and they criticized him sharply but he answered them what have i accomplished compared to you arent the gleanings of ephraims grapes better than the full grape harvest of abiezer god gave oreb and zeeb the midianite leaders into your hands what was i able to do compared to you at this their resentment against him subsided gideon and his three hundred men exhausted yet keeping up the pursuit came to the jordan and crossed it he said to the men of succoth give my troops some bread they are worn out and i am still pursuing zebah and zalmunna the kings of midian but the officials of succoth said do you already have the hands of zebah and zalmunna in your possession why should we give bread to your troops then gideon replied just for that when the lord has given zebah and zalmunna into my hand i will tear your flesh with desert thorns and briers from there he went up to peniel and made the same request of them but they answered as the men of succoth had so he said to the men of peniel when i return in triumph i will tear down this tower now zebah and zalmunna were in karkor with a force of about fifteen thousand men all that were left of the armies of the eastern peoples a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen gideon went up by the route of the nomads east of nobah and jogbehah and fell upon the unsuspecting army zebah and zalmunna the two kings of midian fled but he pursued them and captured them routing their entire army gideon son of joash then returned from the battle by the pass of heres he caught a young man of succoth and questioned him and the young man wrote down for him the names of the seventy seven officials of succoth the elders of the town then gideon came and said to the men of succoth here are zebah and zalmunna about whom you taunted me by saying do you already have the hands of zebah and zalmunna in your possession why should we give bread to your exhausted men he took the elders of the town and taught the men of succoth a lesson by punishing them with desert thorns and briers he also pulled down the tower of peniel and killed the men of the town then he asked zebah and zalmunna what kind of men did you kill at tabormen like you they answered each one with the bearing of a prince gideon replied those were my brothers the sons of my own mother as surely as the lord lives if you had spared their lives i would not kill you turning to jether his oldest son he said kill them but jether did not draw his sword because he was only a boy and was afraid zebah and zalmunna said come do it yourself as is the man so is his strength so gideon stepped forward and killed them and took the ornaments off their camels necks the israelites said to gideon rule over us you your son and your grandson because you have saved us out of the hand of midian but gideon told them i will not rule over you nor will my son rule over you the lord will rule over you and he said i do have one request that each of you give me an earring from your share of the plunder it was the custom of the ishmaelites to wear gold earrings they answered well be glad to give them so they spread out a garment and each man threw a ring from his plunder onto it the weight of the gold rings he asked for came to seventeen hundred shekels not counting the ornaments the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of midian or the chains that were on their camels necks gideon made the gold into an ephod which he placed in ophrah his town all israel prostituted themselves by worshiping it there and it became a snare to gideon and his family thus midian was subdued before the israelites and did not raise its head again during gideons lifetime the land enjoyed peace forty years jerub baal son of joash went back home to live he had seventy sons of his own for he had many wives his concubine who lived in shechem also bore him a son whom he named abimelech gideon son of joash died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of his father joash in ophrah of the abiezrites no sooner had gideon died than the israelites again prostituted themselves to the baals they set up baal berith as their god and did not remember the lord their god who had rescued them from the hands of all their enemies on every side they also failed to show kindness to the family of jerub baal that is gideon for all the good things he had done for them abimelech son of jerub baal went to his mothers brothers in shechem and said to them and to all his mothers clan ask all the citizens of shechem which is better for you to have all seventy of jerub baals sons rule over you or just one man remember i am your flesh and blood when the brothers repeated all this to the citizens of shechem they were inclined to follow abimelech for they said he is our brother they gave him seventy shekels of silver from the temple of baal berith and abimelech used it to hire reckless adventurers who became his followers he went to his fathers home in ophrah and on one stone murdered his seventy brothers the sons of jerub baal but jotham the youngest son of jerub baal escaped by hiding then all the citizens of shechem and beth millo gathered beside the great tree at the pillar in shechem to crown abimelech king when jotham was told about this he climbed up on the top of mount gerizim and shouted to them listen to me citizens of shechem so that god may listen to you one day the trees went out to anoint a king for themselves they said to the olive tree be our king but the olive tree answered should i give up my oil by which both gods and men are honored to hold sway over the trees next the trees said to the fig tree come and be our king but the fig tree replied should i give up my fruit so good and sweet to hold sway over the trees then the trees said to the vine come and be our king but the vine answered should i give up my wine which cheers both gods and men to hold sway over the trees finally all the trees said to the thornbush come and be our king the thornbush said to the trees if you really want to anoint me king over you come and take refuge in my shade but if not then let fire come out of the thornbush and consume the cedars of lebanon now if you have acted honorably and in good faith when you made abimelech king and if you have been fair to jerub baal and his family and if you have treated him as he deserves and to think that my father fought for you risked his life to rescue you from the hand of midian but today you have revolted against my fathers family murdered his seventy sons on a single stone and made abimelech the son of his slave girl king over the citizens of shechem because he is your brother if then you have acted honorably and in good faith toward jerub baal and his family today may abimelech be your joy and may you be his too but if you have not let fire come out from abimelech and consume you citizens of shechem and beth millo and let fire come out from you citizens of shechem and beth millo and consume abimelech then jotham fled escaping to beer and he lived there because he was afraid of his brother abimelech after abimelech had governed israel three years god sent an evil spirit between abimelech and the citizens of shechem who acted treacherously against abimelech god did this in order that the crime against jerub baals seventy sons the shedding of their blood might be avenged on their brother abimelech and on the citizens of shechem who had helped him murder his brothers in opposition to him these citizens of shechem set men on the hilltops to ambush and rob everyone who passed by and this was reported to abimelech now gaal son of ebed moved with his brothers into shechem and its citizens put their confidence in him after they had gone out into the fields and gathered the grapes and trodden them they held a festival in the temple of their god while they were eating and drinking they cursed abimelech then gaal son of ebed said who is abimelech and who is shechem that we should be subject to him isnt he jerub baals son and isnt zebul his deputy serve the men of hamor shechems father why should we serve abimelech if only this people were under my command then i would get rid of him i would say to abimelech call out your whole army when zebul the governor of the city heard what gaal son of ebed said he was very angry under cover he sent messengers to abimelech saying gaal son of ebed and his brothers have come to shechem and are stirring up the city against you now then during the night you and your men should come and lie in wait in the fields in the morning at sunrise advance against the city when gaal and his men come out against you do whatever your hand finds to do so abimelech and all his troops set out by night and took up concealed positions near shechem in four companies now gaal son of ebed had gone out and was standing at the entrance to the city gate just as abimelech and his soldiers came out from their hiding place when gaal saw them he said to zebul look people are coming down from the tops of the mountains zebul replied you mistake the shadows of the mountains for men but gaal spoke up again look people are coming down from the center of the land and a company is coming from the direction of the soothsayers tree then zebul said to him where is your big talk now you who said who is abimelech that we should be subject to him arent these the men you ridiculed go out and fight them so gaal led out the citizens of shechem and fought abimelech abimelech chased him and many fell wounded in the flight all the way to the entrance to the gate abimelech stayed in arumah and zebul drove gaal and his brothers out of shechem the next day the people of shechem went out to the fields and this was reported to abimelech so he took his men divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields when he saw the people coming out of the city he rose to attack them abimelech and the companies with him rushed forward to a position at the entrance to the city gate then two companies rushed upon those in the fields and struck them down all that day abimelech pressed his attack against the city until he had captured it and killed its people then he destroyed the city and scattered salt over it on hearing this the citizens in the tower of shechem went into the stronghold of the temple of el berith when abimelech heard that they had assembled there he and all his men went up mount zalmon he took an ax and cut off some branches which he lifted to his shoulders he ordered the men with him quick do what you have seen me do so all the men cut branches and followed abimelech they piled them against the stronghold and set it on fire over the people inside so all the people in the tower of shechem about a thousand men and women also died next abimelech went to thebez and besieged it and captured it inside the city however was a strong tower to which all the men and women all the people of the city fled they locked themselves in and climbed up on the tower roof abimelech went to the tower and stormed it but as he approached the entrance to the tower to set it on fire a woman dropped an upper millstone on his head and cracked his skull hurriedly he called to his armor bearer draw your sword and kill me so that they cant say a woman killed him so his servant ran him through and he died when the israelites saw that abimelech was dead they went home thus god repaid the wickedness that abimelech had done to his father by murdering his seventy brothers god also made the men of shechem pay for all their wickedness the curse of jotham son of jerub baal came on them after the time of abimelech a man of issachar tola son of puah the son of dodo rose to save israel he lived in shamir in the hill country of ephraim he led israel twenty three years then he died and was buried in shamir he was followed by jair of gilead who led israel twenty two years he had thirty sons who rode thirty donkeys they controlled thirty towns in gilead which to this day are called havvoth jair when jair died he was buried in kamon again the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord they served the baals and the ashtoreths and the gods of aram the gods of sidon the gods of moab the gods of the ammonites and the gods of the philistines and because the israelites forsook the lord and no longer served him he became angry with them he sold them into the hands of the philistines and the ammonites who that year shattered and crushed them for eighteen years they oppressed all the israelites on the east side of the jordan in gilead the land of the amorites the ammonites also crossed the jordan to fight against judah benjamin and the house of ephraim and israel was in great distress then the israelites cried out to the lord we have sinned against you forsaking our god and serving the baals the lord replied when the egyptians the amorites the ammonites the philistines the sidonians the amalekites and the maonites oppressed you and you cried to me for help did i not save you from their hands but you have forsaken me and served other gods so i will no longer save you go and cry out to the gods you have chosen let them save you when you are in trouble but the israelites said to the lord we have sinned do with us whatever you think best but please rescue us now then they got rid of the foreign gods among them and served the lord and he could bear israels misery no longer when the ammonites were called to arms and camped in gilead the israelites assembled and camped at mizpah the leaders of the people of gilead said to each other whoever will launch the attack against the ammonites will be the head of all those living in gilead jephthah the gileadite was a mighty warrior his father was gilead his mother was a prostitute gileads wife also bore him sons and when they were grown up they drove jephthah away you are not going to get any inheritance in our family they said because you are the son of another woman so jephthah fled from his brothers and settled in the land of tob where a group of adventurers gathered around him and followed him some time later when the ammonites made war on israel the elders of gilead went to get jephthah from the land of tob come they said be our commander so we can fight the ammonites jephthah said to them didnt you hate me and drive me from my fathers house why do you come to me now when youre in trouble the elders of gilead said to him nevertheless we are turning to you now come with us to fight the ammonites and you will be our head over all who live in gilead jephthah answered suppose you take me back to fight the ammonites and the lord gives them to me will i really be your head the elders of gilead replied the lord is our witness we will certainly do as you say so jephthah went with the elders of gilead and the people made him head and commander over them and he repeated all his words before the lord in mizpah then jephthah sent messengers to the ammonite king with the question what do you have against us that you have attacked our country the king of the ammonites answered jephthahs messengers when israel came up out of egypt they took away my land from the arnon to the jabbok all the way to the jordan now give it back peaceably jephthah sent back messengers to the ammonite king saying this is what jephthah says israel did not take the land of moab or the land of the ammonites but when they came up out of egypt israel went through the desert to the red sea and on to kadesh then israel sent messengers to the king of edom saying give us permission to go through your country but the king of edom would not listen they sent also to the king of moab and he refused so israel stayed at kadesh next they traveled through the desert skirted the lands of edom and moab passed along the eastern side of the country of moab and camped on the other side of the arnon they did not enter the territory of moab for the arnon was its border then israel sent messengers to sihon king of the amorites who ruled in heshbon and said to him let us pass through your country to our own place sihon however did not trust israel to pass through his territory he mustered all his men and encamped at jahaz and fought with israel then the lord the god of israel gave sihon and all his men into israels hands and they defeated them israel took over all the land of the amorites who lived in that country capturing all of it from the arnon to the jabbok and from the desert to the jordan now since the lord the god of israel has driven the amorites out before his people israel what right have you to take it over will you not take what your god chemosh gives you likewise whatever the lord our god has given us we will possess are you better than balak son of zippor king of moab did he ever quarrel with israel or fight with them for three hundred years israel occupied heshbon aroer the surrounding settlements and all the towns along the arnon why didnt you retake them during that time i have not wronged you but you are doing me wrong by waging war against me let the lord the judge decide the dispute this day between the israelites and the ammonites the king of ammon however paid no attention to the message jephthah sent him then the spirit of the lord came upon jephthah he crossed gilead and manasseh passed through mizpah of gilead and from there he advanced against the ammonites and jephthah made a vow to the lord if you give the ammonites into my hands whatever comes out of the door of my house to meet me when i return in triumph from the ammonites will be the lord s and i will sacrifice it as a burnt offering then jephthah went over to fight the ammonites and the lord gave them into his hands he devastated twenty towns from aroer to the vicinity of minnith as far as abel keramim thus israel subdued ammon when jephthah returned to his home in mizpah who should come out to meet him but his daughter dancing to the sound of tambourines she was an only child except for her he had neither son nor daughter when he saw her he tore his clothes and cried oh my daughter you have made me miserable and wretched because i have made a vow to the lord that i cannot break my father she replied you have given your word to the lord do to me just as you promised now that the lord has avenged you of your enemies the ammonites but grant me this one request she said give me two months to roam the hills and weep with my friends because i will never marry you may go he said and he let her go for two months she and the girls went into the hills and wept because she would never marry after the two months she returned to her father and he did to her as he had vowed and she was a virgin from this comes the israelite custom that each year the young women of israel go out for four days to commemorate the daughter of jephthah the gileadite the men of ephraim called out their forces crossed over to zaphon and said to jephthah why did you go to fight the ammonites without calling us to go with you were going to burn down your house over your head jephthah answered i and my people were engaged in a great struggle with the ammonites and although i called you didnt save me out of their hands when i saw that you wouldnt help i took my life in my hands and crossed over to fight the ammonites and the lord gave me the victory over them now why have you come up today to fight me jephthah then called together the men of gilead and fought against ephraim the gileadites struck them down because the ephraimites had said you gileadites are renegades from ephraim and manasseh the gileadites captured the fords of the jordan leading to ephraim and whenever a survivor of ephraim said let me cross over the men of gilead asked him are you an ephraimite if he replied no they said all right say shibboleth if he said sibboleth because he could not pronounce the word correctly they seized him and killed him at the fords of the jordan forty two thousand ephraimites were killed at that time jephthah led israel six years then jephthah the gileadite died and was buried in a town in gilead after him ibzan of bethlehem led israel he had thirty sons and thirty daughters he gave his daughters away in marriage to those outside his clan and for his sons he brought in thirty young women as wives from outside his clan ibzan led israel seven years then ibzan died and was buried in bethlehem after him elon the zebulunite led israel ten years then elon died and was buried in aijalon in the land of zebulun after him abdon son of hillel from pirathon led israel he had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys he led israel eight years then abdon son of hillel died and was buried at pirathon in ephraim in the hill country of the amalekites again the israelites did evil in the eyes of the lord so the lord delivered them into the hands of the philistines for forty years a certain man of zorah named manoah from the clan of the danites had a wife who was sterile and remained childless the angel of the lord appeared to her and said you are sterile and childless but you are going to conceive and have a son now see to it that you drink no wine or other fermented drink and that you do not eat anything unclean because you will conceive and give birth to a son no razor may be used on his head because the boy is to be a nazirite set apart to god from birth and he will begin the deliverance of israel from the hands of the philistines then the woman went to her husband and told him a man of god came to me he looked like an angel of god very awesome i didnt ask him where he came from and he didnt tell me his name but he said to me you will conceive and give birth to a son now then drink no wine or other fermented drink and do not eat anything unclean because the boy will be a nazirite of god from birth until the day of his death then manoah prayed to the lord o lord i beg you let the man of god you sent to us come again to teach us how to bring up the boy who is to be born god heard manoah and the angel of god came again to the woman while she was out in the field but her husband manoah was not with her the woman hurried to tell her husband hes here the man who appeared to me the other day manoah got up and followed his wife when he came to the man he said are you the one who talked to my wifei am he said so manoah asked him when your words are fulfilled what is to be the rule for the boys life and work the angel of the lord answered your wife must do all that i have told her she must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine nor drink any wine or other fermented drink nor eat anything unclean she must do everything i have commanded her manoah said to the angel of the lord we would like you to stay until we prepare a young goat for you the angel of the lord replied even though you detain me i will not eat any of your food but if you prepare a burnt offering offer it to the lord manoah did not realize that it was the angel of the lord then manoah inquired of the angel of the lord what is your name so that we may honor you when your word comes true he replied why do you ask my name it is beyond understanding then manoah took a young goat together with the grain offering and sacrificed it on a rock to the lord and the lord did an amazing thing while manoah and his wife watched as the flame blazed up from the altar toward heaven the angel of the lord ascended in the flame seeing this manoah and his wife fell with their faces to the ground when the angel of the lord did not show himself again to manoah and his wife manoah realized that it was the angel of the lord we are doomed to die he said to his wife we have seen god but his wife answered if the lord had meant to kill us he would not have accepted a burnt offering and grain offering from our hands nor shown us all these things or now told us this the woman gave birth to a boy and named him samson he grew and the lord blessed him and the spirit of the lord began to stir him while he was in mahaneh dan between zorah and eshtaol samson went down to timnah and saw there a young philistine woman when he returned he said to his father and mother i have seen a philistine woman in timnah now get her for me as my wife his father and mother replied isnt there an acceptable woman among your relatives or among all our people must you go to the uncircumcised philistines to get a wife but samson said to his father get her for me shes the right one for me his parents did not know that this was from the lord who was seeking an occasion to confront the philistines for at that time they were ruling over israel samson went down to timnah together with his father and mother as they approached the vineyards of timnah suddenly a young lion came roaring toward him the spirit of the lord came upon him in power so that he tore the lion apart with his bare hands as he might have torn a young goat but he told neither his father nor his mother what he had done then he went down and talked with the woman and he liked her some time later when he went back to marry her he turned aside to look at the lions carcass in it was a swarm of bees and some honey which he scooped out with his hands and ate as he went along when he rejoined his parents he gave them some and they too ate it but he did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the lions carcass now his father went down to see the woman and samson made a feast there as was customary for bridegrooms when he appeared he was given thirty companions let me tell you a riddle samson said to them if you can give me the answer within the seven days of the feast i will give you thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothes if you cant tell me the answer you must give me thirty linen garments and thirty sets of clothestell us your riddle they said lets hear it he replied out of the eater something to eat out of the strong something sweet for three days they could not give the answer on the fourth day they said to samsons wife coax your husband into explaining the riddle for us or we will burn you and your fathers household to death did you invite us here to rob us then samsons wife threw herself on him sobbing you hate me you dont really love me youve given my people a riddle but you havent told me the answeri havent even explained it to my father or mother he replied so why should i explain it to you she cried the whole seven days of the feast so on the seventh day he finally told her because she continued to press him she in turn explained the riddle to her people before sunset on the seventh day the men of the town said to him what is sweeter than honey what is stronger than a lion samson said to them if you had not plowed with my heifer you would not have solved my riddle then the spirit of the lord came upon him in power he went down to ashkelon struck down thirty of their men stripped them of their belongings and gave their clothes to those who had explained the riddle burning with anger he went up to his fathers house and samsons wife was given to the friend who had attended him at his wedding later on at the time of wheat harvest samson took a young goat and went to visit his wife he said im going to my wifes room but her father would not let him go in i was so sure you thoroughly hated her he said that i gave her to your friend isnt her younger sister more attractive take her instead samson said to them this time i have a right to get even with the philistines i will really harm them so he went out and caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs he then fastened a torch to every pair of tails lit the torches and let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the philistines he burned up the shocks and standing grain together with the vineyards and olive groves when the philistines asked who did this they were told samson the timnites son in law because his wife was given to his friend so the philistines went up and burned her and her father to death samson said to them since youve acted like this i wont stop until i get my revenge on you he attacked them viciously and slaughtered many of them then he went down and stayed in a cave in the rock of etam the philistines went up and camped in judah spreading out near lehi the men of judah asked why have you come to fight uswe have come to take samson prisoner they answered to do to him as he did to us then three thousand men from judah went down to the cave in the rock of etam and said to samson dont you realize that the philistines are rulers over us what have you done to us he answered i merely did to them what they did to me they said to him weve come to tie you up and hand you over to the philistines samson said swear to me that you wont kill me yourselves agreed they answered we will only tie you up and hand you over to them we will not kill you so they bound him with two new ropes and led him up from the rock as he approached lehi the philistines came toward him shouting the spirit of the lord came upon him in power the ropes on his arms became like charred flax and the bindings dropped from his hands finding a fresh jawbone of a donkey he grabbed it and struck down a thousand men then samson said with a donkeys jawbone i have made donkeys of them with a donkeys jawbone i have killed a thousand men when he finished speaking he threw away the jawbone and the place was called ramath lehi because he was very thirsty he cried out to the lord you have given your servant this great victory must i now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised then god opened up the hollow place in lehi and water came out of it when samson drank his strength returned and he revived so the spring was called en hakkore and it is still there in lehi samson led israel for twenty years in the days of the philistines one day samson went to gaza where he saw a prostitute he went in to spend the night with her the people of gaza were told samson is here so they surrounded the place and lay in wait for him all night at the city gate they made no move during the night saying at dawn well kill him but samson lay there only until the middle of the night then he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate together with the two posts and tore them loose bar and all he lifted them to his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that faces hebron some time later he fell in love with a woman in the valley of sorek whose name was delilah the rulers of the philistines went to her and said see if you can lure him into showing you the secret of his great strength and how we can overpower him so we may tie him up and subdue him each one of us will give you eleven hundred shekels of silver so delilah said to samson tell me the secret of your great strength and how you can be tied up and subdued samson answered her if anyone ties me with seven fresh thongs that have not been dried ill become as weak as any other man then the rulers of the philistines brought her seven fresh thongs that had not been dried and she tied him with them with men hidden in the room she called to him samson the philistines are upon you but he snapped the thongs as easily as a piece of string snaps when it comes close to a flame so the secret of his strength was not discovered then delilah said to samson you have made a fool of me you lied to me come now tell me how you can be tied he said if anyone ties me securely with new ropes that have never been used ill become as weak as any other man so delilah took new ropes and tied him with them then with men hidden in the room she called to him samson the philistines are upon you but he snapped the ropes off his arms as if they were threads delilah then said to samson until now you have been making a fool of me and lying to me tell me how you can be tied he replied if you weave the seven braids of my head into the fabric on the loom and tighten it with the pin ill become as weak as any other man so while he was sleeping delilah took the seven braids of his head wove them into the fabric and tightened it with the pin again she called to him samson the philistines are upon you he awoke from his sleep and pulled up the pin and the loom with the fabric then she said to him how can you say i love you when you wont confide in me this is the third time you have made a fool of me and havent told me the secret of your great strength with such nagging she prodded him day after day until he was tired to death so he told her everything no razor has ever been used on my head he said because i have been a nazirite set apart to god since birth if my head were shaved my strength would leave me and i would become as weak as any other man when delilah saw that he had told her everything she sent word to the rulers of the philistines come back once more he has told me everything so the rulers of the philistines returned with the silver in their hands having put him to sleep on her lap she called a man to shave off the seven braids of his hair and so began to subdue him and his strength left him then she called samson the philistines are upon you he awoke from his sleep and thought ill go out as before and shake myself free but he did not know that the lord had left him then the philistines seized him gouged out his eyes and took him down to gaza binding him with bronze shackles they set him to grinding in the prison but the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved now the rulers of the philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to dagon their god and to celebrate saying our god has delivered samson our enemy into our hands when the people saw him they praised their god saying our god has delivered our enemy into our hands the one who laid waste our land and multiplied our slain while they were in high spirits they shouted bring out samson to entertain us so they called samson out of the prison and he performed for them when they stood him among the pillars samson said to the servant who held his hand put me where i can feel the pillars that support the temple so that i may lean against them now the temple was crowded with men and women all the rulers of the philistines were there and on the roof were about three thousand men and women watching samson perform then samson prayed to the lord o sovereign lord remember me o god please strengthen me just once more and let me with one blow get revenge on the philistines for my two eyes then samson reached toward the two central pillars on which the temple stood bracing himself against them his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other samson said let me die with the philistines then he pushed with all his might and down came the temple on the rulers and all the people in it thus he killed many more when he died than while he lived then his brothers and his fathers whole family went down to get him they brought him back and buried him between zorah and eshtaol in the tomb of manoah his father he had led israel twenty years now a man named micah from the hill country of ephraim said to his mother the eleven hundred shekels of silver that were taken from you and about which i heard you utter a curse i have that silver with me i took it then his mother said the lord bless you my son when he returned the eleven hundred shekels of silver to his mother she said i solemnly consecrate my silver to the lord for my son to make a carved image and a cast idol i will give it back to you so he returned the silver to his mother and she took two hundred shekels of silver and gave them to a silversmith who made them into the image and the idol and they were put in micahs house now this man micah had a shrine and he made an ephod and some idols and installed one of his sons as his priest in those days israel had no king everyone did as he saw fit a young levite from bethlehem in judah who had been living within the clan of judah left that town in search of some other place to stay on his way he came to micahs house in the hill country of ephraim micah asked him where are you fromim a levite from bethlehem in judah he said and im looking for a place to stay then micah said to him live with me and be my father and priest and ill give you ten shekels of silver a year your clothes and your food so the levite agreed to live with him and the young man was to him like one of his sons then micah installed the levite and the young man became his priest and lived in his house and micah said now i know that the lord will be good to me since this levite has become my priest in those days israel had no king and in those days the tribe of the danites was seeking a place of their own where they might settle because they had not yet come into an inheritance among the tribes of israel so the danites sent five warriors from zorah and eshtaol to spy out the land and explore it these men represented all their clans they told them go explore the land the men entered the hill country of ephraim and came to the house of micah where they spent the night when they were near micahs house they recognized the voice of the young levite so they turned in there and asked him who brought you here what are you doing in this place why are you here he told them what micah had done for him and said he has hired me and i am his priest then they said to him please inquire of god to learn whether our journey will be successful the priest answered them go in peace your journey has the lord s approval so the five men left and came to laish where they saw that the people were living in safety like the sidonians unsuspecting and secure and since their land lacked nothing they were prosperous also they lived a long way from the sidonians and had no relationship with anyone else when they returned to zorah and eshtaol their brothers asked them how did you find things they answered come on lets attack them we have seen that the land is very good arent you going to do something dont hesitate to go there and take it over when you get there you will find an unsuspecting people and a spacious land that god has put into your hands a land that lacks nothing whatever then six hundred men from the clan of the danites armed for battle set out from zorah and eshtaol on their way they set up camp near kiriath jearim in judah this is why the place west of kiriath jearim is called mahaneh dan to this day from there they went on to the hill country of ephraim and came to micahs house then the five men who had spied out the land of laish said to their brothers do you know that one of these houses has an ephod other household gods a carved image and a cast idol now you know what to do so they turned in there and went to the house of the young levite at micahs place and greeted him the six hundred danites armed for battle stood at the entrance to the gate the five men who had spied out the land went inside and took the carved image the ephod the other household gods and the cast idol while the priest and the six hundred armed men stood at the entrance to the gate when these men went into micahs house and took the carved image the ephod the other household gods and the cast idol the priest said to them what are you doing they answered him be quiet dont say a word come with us and be our father and priest isnt it better that you serve a tribe and clan in israel as priest rather than just one mans household then the priest was glad he took the ephod the other household gods and the carved image and went along with the people putting their little children their livestock and their possessions in front of them they turned away and left when they had gone some distance from micahs house the men who lived near micah were called together and overtook the danites as they shouted after them the danites turned and said to micah whats the matter with you that you called out your men to fight he replied you took the gods i made and my priest and went away what else do i have how can you ask whats the matter with you the danites answered dont argue with us or some hot tempered men will attack you and you and your family will lose your lives so the danites went their way and micah seeing that they were too strong for him turned around and went back home then they took what micah had made and his priest and went on to laish against a peaceful and unsuspecting people they attacked them with the sword and burned down their city there was no one to rescue them because they lived a long way from sidon and had no relationship with anyone else the city was in a valley near beth rehob the danites rebuilt the city and settled there they named it dan after their forefather dan who was born to israel though the city used to be called laish there the danites set up for themselves the idols and jonathan son of gershom the son of moses and his sons were priests for the tribe of dan until the time of the captivity of the land they continued to use the idols micah had made all the time the house of god was in shiloh in those days israel had no king now a levite who lived in a remote area in the hill country of ephraim took a concubine from bethlehem in judah but she was unfaithful to him she left him and went back to her fathers house in bethlehem judah after she had been there four months her husband went to her to persuade her to return he had with him his servant and two donkeys she took him into her fathers house and when her father saw him he gladly welcomed him his father in law the girls father prevailed upon him to stay so he remained with him three days eating and drinking and sleeping there on the fourth day they got up early and he prepared to leave but the girls father said to his son in law refresh yourself with something to eat then you can go so the two of them sat down to eat and drink together afterward the girls father said please stay tonight and enjoy yourself and when the man got up to go his father in law persuaded him so he stayed there that night on the morning of the fifth day when he rose to go the girls father said refresh yourself wait till afternoon so the two of them ate together then when the man with his concubine and his servant got up to leave his father in law the girls father said now look its almost evening spend the night here the day is nearly over stay and enjoy yourself early tomorrow morning you can get up and be on your way home but unwilling to stay another night the man left and went toward jebus that is jerusalem with his two saddled donkeys and his concubine when they were near jebus and the day was almost gone the servant said to his master come lets stop at this city of the jebusites and spend the night his master replied no we wont go into an alien city whose people are not israelites we will go on to gibeah he added come lets try to reach gibeah or ramah and spend the night in one of those places so they went on and the sun set as they neared gibeah in benjamin there they stopped to spend the night they went and sat in the city square but no one took them into his home for the night that evening an old man from the hill country of ephraim who was living in gibeah the men of the place were benjamites came in from his work in the fields when he looked and saw the traveler in the city square the old man asked where are you going where did you come from he answered we are on our way from bethlehem in judah to a remote area in the hill country of ephraim where i live i have been to bethlehem in judah and now i am going to the house of the lord no one has taken me into his house we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys and bread and wine for ourselves your servants me your maidservant and the young man with us we dont need anything you are welcome at my house the old man said let me supply whatever you need only dont spend the night in the square so he took him into his house and fed his donkeys after they had washed their feet they had something to eat and drink while they were enjoying themselves some of the wicked men of the city surrounded the house pounding on the door they shouted to the old man who owned the house bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him the owner of the house went outside and said to them no my friends dont be so vile since this man is my guest dont do this disgraceful thing look here is my virgin daughter and his concubine i will bring them out to you now and you can use them and do to them whatever you wish but to this man dont do such a disgraceful thing but the men would not listen to him so the man took his concubine and sent her outside to them and they raped her and abused her throughout the night and at dawn they let her go at daybreak the woman went back to the house where her master was staying fell down at the door and lay there until daylight when her master got up in the morning and opened the door of the house and stepped out to continue on his way there lay his concubine fallen in the doorway of the house with her hands on the threshold he said to her get up lets go but there was no answer then the man put her on his donkey and set out for home when he reached home he took a knife and cut up his concubine limb by limb into twelve parts and sent them into all the areas of israel everyone who saw it said such a thing has never been seen or done not since the day the israelites came up out of egypt think about it consider it tell us what to do then all the israelites from dan to beersheba and from the land of gilead came out as one man and assembled before the lord in mizpah the leaders of all the people of the tribes of israel took their places in the assembly of the people of god four hundred thousand soldiers armed with swords the benjamites heard that the israelites had gone up to mizpah then the israelites said tell us how this awful thing happened so the levite the husband of the murdered woman said i and my concubine came to gibeah in benjamin to spend the night during the night the men of gibeah came after me and surrounded the house intending to kill me they raped my concubine and she died i took my concubine cut her into pieces and sent one piece to each region of israels inheritance because they committed this lewd and disgraceful act in israel now all you israelites speak up and give your verdict all the people rose as one man saying none of us will go home no not one of us will return to his house but now this is what well do to gibeah well go up against it as the lot directs well take ten men out of every hundred from all the tribes of israel and a hundred from a thousand and a thousand from ten thousand to get provisions for the army then when the army arrives at gibeah in benjamin it can give them what they deserve for all this vileness done in israel so all the men of israel got together and united as one man against the city the tribes of israel sent men throughout the tribe of benjamin saying what about this awful crime that was committed among you now surrender those wicked men of gibeah so that we may put them to death and purge the evil from israel but the benjamites would not listen to their fellow israelites from their towns they came together at gibeah to fight against the israelites at once the benjamites mobilized twenty six thousand swordsmen from their towns in addition to seven hundred chosen men from those living in gibeah among all these soldiers there were seven hundred chosen men who were left handed each of whom could sling a stone at a hair and not miss israel apart from benjamin mustered four hundred thousand swordsmen all of them fighting men the israelites went up to bethel and inquired of god they said who of us shall go first to fight against the benjamites the lord replied judah shall go first the next morning the israelites got up and pitched camp near gibeah the men of israel went out to fight the benjamites and took up battle positions against them at gibeah the benjamites came out of gibeah and cut down twenty two thousand israelites on the battlefield that day but the men of israel encouraged one another and again took up their positions where they had stationed themselves the first day the israelites went up and wept before the lord until evening and they inquired of the lord they said shall we go up again to battle against the benjamites our brothers the lord answered go up against them then the israelites drew near to benjamin the second day this time when the benjamites came out from gibeah to oppose them they cut down another eighteen thousand israelites all of them armed with swords then the israelites all the people went up to bethel and there they sat weeping before the lord they fasted that day until evening and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to the lord and the israelites inquired of the lord in those days the ark of the covenant of god was there with phinehas son of eleazar the son of aaron ministering before it they asked shall we go up again to battle with benjamin our brother or not the lord responded go for tomorrow i will give them into your hands then israel set an ambush around gibeah they went up against the benjamites on the third day and took up positions against gibeah as they had done before the benjamites came out to meet them and were drawn away from the city they began to inflict casualties on the israelites as before so that about thirty men fell in the open field and on the roads the one leading to bethel and the other to gibeah while the benjamites were saying we are defeating them as before the israelites were saying lets retreat and draw them away from the city to the roads all the men of israel moved from their places and took up positions at baal tamar and the israelite ambush charged out of its place on the west of gibeah then ten thousand of israels finest men made a frontal attack on gibeah the fighting was so heavy that the benjamites did not realize how near disaster was the lord defeated benjamin before israel and on that day the israelites struck down 25100 benjamites all armed with swords then the benjamites saw that they were beaten now the men of israel had given way before benjamin because they relied on the ambush they had set near gibeah the men who had been in ambush made a sudden dash into gibeah spread out and put the whole city to the sword the men of israel had arranged with the ambush that they should send up a great cloud of smoke from the city and then the men of israel would turn in the battle the benjamites had begun to inflict casualties on the men of israel about thirty and they said we are defeating them as in the first battle but when the column of smoke began to rise from the city the benjamites turned and saw the smoke of the whole city going up into the sky then the men of israel turned on them and the men of benjamin were terrified because they realized that disaster had come upon them so they fled before the israelites in the direction of the desert but they could not escape the battle and the men of israel who came out of the towns cut them down there they surrounded the benjamites chased them and easily overran them in the vicinity of gibeah on the east eighteen thousand benjamites fell all of them valiant fighters as they turned and fled toward the desert to the rock of rimmon the israelites cut down five thousand men along the roads they kept pressing after the benjamites as far as gidom and struck down two thousand more on that day twenty five thousand benjamite swordsmen fell all of them valiant fighters but six hundred men turned and fled into the desert to the rock of rimmon where they stayed four months the men of israel went back to benjamin and put all the towns to the sword including the animals and everything else they found all the towns they came across they set on fire the men of israel had taken an oath at mizpah not one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a benjamite the people went to bethel where they sat before god until evening raising their voices and weeping bitterly o lord the god of israel they cried why has this happened to israel why should one tribe be missing from israel today early the next day the people built an altar and presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings then the israelites asked who from all the tribes of israel has failed to assemble before the lord for they had taken a solemn oath that anyone who failed to assemble before the lord at mizpah should certainly be put to death now the israelites grieved for their brothers the benjamites today one tribe is cut off from israel they said how can we provide wives for those who are left since we have taken an oath by the lord not to give them any of our daughters in marriage then they asked which one of the tribes of israel failed to assemble before the lord at mizpah they discovered that no one from jabesh gilead had come to the camp for the assembly for when they counted the people they found that none of the people of jabesh gilead were there so the assembly sent twelve thousand fighting men with instructions to go to jabesh gilead and put to the sword those living there including the women and children this is what you are to do they said kill every male and every woman who is not a virgin they found among the people living in jabesh gilead four hundred young women who had never slept with a man and they took them to the camp at shiloh in canaan then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the benjamites at the rock of rimmon so the benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of jabesh gilead who had been spared but there were not enough for all of them the people grieved for benjamin because the lord had made a gap in the tribes of israel and the elders of the assembly said with the women of benjamin destroyed how shall we provide wives for the men who are left the benjamite survivors must have heirs they said so that a tribe of israel will not be wiped out we cant give them our daughters as wives since we israelites have taken this oath cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a benjamite but look there is the annual festival of the lord in shiloh to the north of bethel and east of the road that goes from bethel to shechem and to the south of lebonah so they instructed the benjamites saying go and hide in the vineyards and watch when the girls of shiloh come out to join in the dancing then rush from the vineyards and each of you seize a wife from the girls of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin when their fathers or brothers complain to us we will say to them do us a kindness by helping them because we did not get wives for them during the war and you are innocent since you did not give your daughters to them so that is what the benjamites did while the girls were dancing each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them at that time the israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans each to his own inheritance in those days israel had no king everyone did as he saw fit  in the days when the judges ruled there was a famine in the land and a man from bethlehem in judah together with his wife and two sons went to live for a while in the country of moab the mans name was elimelech his wifes name naomi and the names of his two sons were mahlon and kilion they were ephrathites from bethlehem judah and they went to moab and lived there now elimelech naomis husband died and she was left with her two sons they married moabite women one named orpah and the other ruth after they had lived there about ten years both mahlon and kilion also died and naomi was left without her two sons and her husband when she heard in moab that the lord had come to the aid of his people by providing food for them naomi and her daughters in law prepared to return home from there with her two daughters in law she left the place where she had been living and set out on the road that would take them back to the land of judah then naomi said to her two daughters in law go back each of you to your mothers home may the lord show kindness to you as you have shown to your dead and to me may the lord grant that each of you will find rest in the home of another husband then she kissed them and they wept aloud and said to her we will go back with you to your people but naomi said return home my daughters why would you come with me am i going to have any more sons who could become your husbands return home my daughters i am too old to have another husband even if i thought there was still hope for me even if i had a husband tonight and then gave birth to sons would you wait until they grew up would you remain unmarried for them no my daughters it is more bitter for me than for you because the lords hand has gone out against me at this they wept again then orpah kissed her mother in law good by but ruth clung to her look said naomi your sister in law is going back to her people and her gods go back with her but ruth replied dont urge me to leave you or to turn back from you where you go i will go and where you stay i will stay your people will be my people and your god my god where you die i will die and there i will be buried may the lord deal with me be it ever so severely if anything but death separates you and me when naomi realized that ruth was determined to go with her she stopped urging her so the two women went on until they came to bethlehem when they arrived in bethlehem the whole town was stirred because of them and the women exclaimed can this be naomi dont call me naomi she told them call me mara because the almighty has made my life very bitter i went away full but the lord has brought me back empty why call me naomi the lord has afflicted me the almighty has brought misfortune upon me so naomi returned from moab accompanied by ruth the moabitess her daughter in law arriving in bethlehem as the barley harvest was beginning now naomi had a relative on her husbands side from the clan of elimelech a man of standing whose name was boaz and ruth the moabitess said to naomi let me go to the fields and pick up the leftover grain behind anyone in whose eyes i find favor naomi said to her go ahead my daughter so she went out and began to glean in the fields behind the harvesters as it turned out she found herself working in a field belonging to boaz who was from the clan of elimelech just then boaz arrived from bethlehem and greeted the harvesters the lord be with youthe lord bless you they called back boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters whose young woman is that the foreman replied she is the moabitess who came back from moab with naomi she said please let me glean and gather among the sheaves behind the harvesters she went into the field and has worked steadily from morning till now except for a short rest in the shelter so boaz said to ruth my daughter listen to me dont go and glean in another field and dont go away from here stay here with my servant girls watch the field where the men are harvesting and follow along after the girls i have told the men not to touch you and whenever you are thirsty go and get a drink from the water jars the men have filled at this she bowed down with her face to the ground she exclaimed why have i found such favor in your eyes that you notice me a foreigner boaz replied ive been told all about what you have done for your mother in law since the death of your husband how you left your father and mother and your homeland and came to live with a people you did not know before may the lord repay you for what you have done may you be richly rewarded by the lord the god of israel under whose wings you have come to take refuge may i continue to find favor in your eyes my lord she said you have given me comfort and have spoken kindly to your servant though i do not have the standing of one of your servant girls at mealtime boaz said to her come over here have some bread and dip it in the wine vinegar when she sat down with the harvesters he offered her some roasted grain she ate all she wanted and had some left over as she got up to glean boaz gave orders to his men even if she gathers among the sheaves dont embarrass her rather pull out some stalks for her from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up and dont rebuke her so ruth gleaned in the field until evening then she threshed the barley she had gathered and it amounted to about an ephah she carried it back to town and her mother in law saw how much she had gathered ruth also brought out and gave her what she had left over after she had eaten enough her mother in law asked her where did you glean today where did you work blessed be the man who took notice of you then ruth told her mother in law about the one at whose place she had been working the name of the man i worked with today is boaz she said the lord bless him naomi said to her daughter in law he has not stopped showing his kindness to the living and the dead she added that man is our close relative he is one of our kinsman redeemers then ruth the moabitess said he even said to me stay with my workers until they finish harvesting all my grain naomi said to ruth her daughter in law it will be good for you my daughter to go with his girls because in someone elses field you might be harmed so ruth stayed close to the servant girls of boaz to glean until the barley and wheat harvests were finished and she lived with her mother in law one day naomi her mother in law said to her my daughter should i not try to find a home for you where you will be well provided for is not boaz with whose servant girls you have been a kinsman of ours tonight he will be winnowing barley on the threshing floor wash and perfume yourself and put on your best clothes then go down to the threshing floor but dont let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking when he lies down note the place where he is lying then go and uncover his feet and lie down he will tell you what to do i will do whatever you say ruth answered so she went down to the threshing floor and did everything her mother in law told her to do when boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits he went over to lie down at the far end of the grain pile ruth approached quietly uncovered his feet and lay down in the middle of the night something startled the man and he turned and discovered a woman lying at his feet who are you he asked i am your servant ruth she said spread the corner of your garment over me since you are a kinsman redeemer the lord bless you my daughter he replied this kindness is greater than that which you showed earlier you have not run after the younger men whether rich or poor and now my daughter dont be afraid i will do for you all you ask all my fellow townsmen know that you are a woman of noble character although it is true that i am near of kin there is a kinsman redeemer nearer than i stay here for the night and in the morning if he wants to redeem good let him redeem but if he is not willing as surely as the lord lives i will do it lie here until morning so she lay at his feet until morning but got up before anyone could be recognized and he said dont let it be known that a woman came to the threshing floor he also said bring me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out when she did so he poured into it six measures of barley and put it on her then he went back to town when ruth came to her mother in law naomi asked how did it go my daughter then she told her everything boaz had done for her and added he gave me these six measures of barley saying dont go back to your mother in law empty handed then naomi said wait my daughter until you find out what happens for the man will not rest until the matter is settled today meanwhile boaz went up to the town gate and sat there when the kinsman redeemer he had mentioned came along boaz said come over here my friend and sit down so he went over and sat down boaz took ten of the elders of the town and said sit here and they did so then he said to the kinsman redeemer naomi who has come back from moab is selling the piece of land that belonged to our brother elimelech i thought i should bring the matter to your attention and suggest that you buy it in the presence of these seated here and in the presence of the elders of my people if you will redeem it do so but if you will not tell me so i will know for no one has the right to do it except you and i am next in linei will redeem it he said then boaz said on the day you buy the land from naomi and from ruth the moabitess you acquire the dead mans widow in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property at this the kinsman redeemer said then i cannot redeem it because i might endanger my own estate you redeem it yourself i cannot do it now in earlier times in israel for the redemption and transfer of property to become final one party took off his sandal and gave it to the other this was the method of legalizing transactions in israel so the kinsman redeemer said to boaz buy it yourself and he removed his sandal then boaz announced to the elders and all the people today you are witnesses that i have bought from naomi all the property of elimelech kilion and mahlon i have also acquired ruth the moabitess mahlons widow as my wife in order to maintain the name of the dead with his property so that his name will not disappear from among his family or from the town records today you are witnesses then the elders and all those at the gate said we are witnesses may the lord make the woman who is coming into your home like rachel and leah who together built up the house of israel may you have standing in ephrathah and be famous in bethlehem through the offspring the lord gives you by this young woman may your family be like that of perez whom tamar bore to judah so boaz took ruth and she became his wife then he went to her and the lord enabled her to conceive and she gave birth to a son the women said to naomi praise be to the lord who this day has not left you without a kinsman redeemer may he become famous throughout israel he will renew your life and sustain you in your old age for your daughter in law who loves you and who is better to you than seven sons has given him birth then naomi took the child laid him in her lap and cared for him the women living there said naomi has a son and they named him obed he was the father of jesse the father of david this then is the family line of perez perez was the father of hezron hezron the father of ram ram the father of amminadab amminadab the father of nahshon nahshon the father of salmon salmon the father of boaz boaz the father of obed obed the father of jesse and jesse the father of david  there was a certain man from ramathaim a zuphite from the hill country of ephraim whose name was elkanah son of jeroham the son of elihu the son of tohu the son of zuph an ephraimite he had two wives one was called hannah and the other peninnah peninnah had children but hannah had none year after year this man went up from his town to worship and sacrifice to the lord almighty at shiloh where hophni and phinehas the two sons of eli were priests of the lord whenever the day came for elkanah to sacrifice he would give portions of the meat to his wife peninnah and to all her sons and daughters but to hannah he gave a double portion because he loved her and the lord had closed her womb and because the lord had closed her womb her rival kept provoking her in order to irritate her this went on year after year whenever hannah went up to the house of the lord her rival provoked her till she wept and would not eat elkanah her husband would say to her hannah why are you weeping why dont you eat why are you downhearted dont i mean more to you than ten sons once when they had finished eating and drinking in shiloh hannah stood up now eli the priest was sitting on a chair by the doorpost of the lords temple in bitterness of soul hannah wept much and prayed to the lord and she made a vow saying o lord almighty if you will only look upon your servants misery and remember me and not forget your servant but give her a son then i will give him to the lord for all the days of his life and no razor will ever be used on his head as she kept on praying to the lord eli observed her mouth hannah was praying in her heart and her lips were moving but her voice was not heard eli thought she was drunk and said to her how long will you keep on getting drunk get rid of your wine not so my lord hannah replied i am a woman who is deeply troubled i have not been drinking wine or beer i was pouring out my soul to the lord do not take your servant for a wicked woman i have been praying here out of my great anguish and grief eli answered go in peace and may the god of israel grant you what you have asked of him she said may your servant find favor in your eyes then she went her way and ate something and her face was no longer downcast early the next morning they arose and worshiped before the lord and then went back to their home at ramah elkanah lay with hannah his wife and the lord remembered her so in the course of time hannah conceived and gave birth to a son she named him samuel saying because i asked the lord for him when the man elkanah went up with all his family to offer the annual sacrifice to the lord and to fulfill his vow hannah did not go she said to her husband after the boy is weaned i will take him and present him before the lord and he will live there always do what seems best to you elkanah her husband told her stay here until you have weaned him only may the lord make good his word so the woman stayed at home and nursed her son until she had weaned him after he was weaned she took the boy with her young as he was along with a three year old bull an ephah of flour and a skin of wine and brought him to the house of the lord at shiloh when they had slaughtered the bull they brought the boy to eli and she said to him as surely as you live my lord i am the woman who stood here beside you praying to the lord i prayed for this child and the lord has granted me what i asked of him so now i give him to the lord for his whole life he will be given over to the lord and he worshiped the lord there then hannah prayed and said my heart rejoices in the lord in the lord my horn is lifted high my mouth boasts over my enemies for i delight in your deliverance there is no one holy like the lord there is no one besides you there is no rock like our god do not keep talking so proudly or let your mouth speak such arrogance for the lord is a god who knows and by him deeds are weighed the bows of the warriors are broken but those who stumbled are armed with strength those who were full hire themselves out for food but those who were hungry hunger no more she who was barren has borne seven children but she who has had many sons pines away the lord brings death and makes alive he brings down to the grave and raises up the lord sends poverty and wealth he humbles and he exalts he raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap he seats them with princes and has them inherit a throne of honor for the foundations of the earth are the lords upon them he has set the world he will guard the feet of his saints but the wicked will be silenced in darkness it is not by strength that one prevails those who oppose the lord will be shattered he will thunder against them from heaven the lord will judge the ends of the earth he will give strength to his king and exalt the horn of his anointed then elkanah went home to ramah but the boy ministered before the lord under eli the priest elis sons were wicked men they had no regard for the lord now it was the practice of the priests with the people that whenever anyone offered a sacrifice and while the meat was being boiled the servant of the priest would come with a three pronged fork in his hand he would plunge it into the pan or kettle or caldron or pot and the priest would take for himself whatever the fork brought up this is how they treated all the israelites who came to shiloh but even before the fat was burned the servant of the priest would come and say to the man who was sacrificing give the priest some meat to roast he wont accept boiled meat from you but only raw if the man said to him let the fat be burned up first and then take whatever you want the servant would then answer no hand it over now if you dont ill take it by force this sin of the young men was very great in the lords sight for they were treating the lords offering with contempt but samuel was ministering before the lord a boy wearing a linen ephod each year his mother made him a little robe and took it to him when she went up with her husband to offer the annual sacrifice eli would bless elkanah and his wife saying may the lord give you children by this woman to take the place of the one she prayed for and gave to the lord then they would go home and the lord was gracious to hannah she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters meanwhile the boy samuel grew up in the presence of the lord now eli who was very old heard about everything his sons were doing to all israel and how they slept with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting so he said to them why do you do such things i hear from all the people about these wicked deeds of yours no my sons it is not a good report that i hear spreading among the lords people if a man sins against another man god may mediate for him but if a man sins against the lord who will intercede for him his sons however did not listen to their fathers rebuke for it was the lords will to put them to death and the boy samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor with the lord and with men now a man of god came to eli and said to him this is what the lord says did i not clearly reveal myself to your fathers house when they were in egypt under pharaoh i chose your father out of all the tribes of israel to be my priest to go up to my altar to burn incense and to wear an ephod in my presence i also gave your fathers house all the offerings made with fire by the israelites why do you scorn my sacrifice and offering that i prescribed for my dwelling why do you honor your sons more than me by fattening yourselves on the choice parts of every offering made by my people israel therefore the lord the god of israel declares i promised that your house and your fathers house would minister before me forever but now the lord declares far be it from me those who honor me i will honor but those who despise me will be disdained the time is coming when i will cut short your strength and the strength of your fathers house so that there will not be an old man in your family line and you will see distress in my dwelling although good will be done to israel in your family line there will never be an old man every one of you that i do not cut off from my altar will be spared only to blind your eyes with tears and to grieve your heart and all your descendants will die in the prime of life and what happens to your two sons hophni and phinehas will be a sign to you they will both die on the same day i will raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in my heart and mind i will firmly establish his house and he will minister before my anointed one always then everyone left in your family line will come and bow down before him for a piece of silver and a crust of bread and plead appoint me to some priestly office so i can have food to eat the boy samuel ministered before the lord under eli in those days the word of the lord was rare there were not many visions one night eli whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see was lying down in his usual place the lamp of god had not yet gone out and samuel was lying down in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was then the lord called samuel samuel answered here i am and he ran to eli and said here i am you called me but eli said i did not call go back and lie down so he went and lay down again the lord called samuel and samuel got up and went to eli and said here i am you called memy son eli said i did not call go back and lie down now samuel did not yet know the lord the word of the lord had not yet been revealed to him the lord called samuel a third time and samuel got up and went to eli and said here i am you called me then eli realized that the lord was calling the boy so eli told samuel go and lie down and if he calls you say speak lord for your servant is listening so samuel went and lay down in his place the lord came and stood there calling as at the other times samuel samuel then samuel said speak for your servant is listening and the lord said to samuel see i am about to do something in israel that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle at that time i will carry out against eli everything i spoke against his family from beginning to end for i told him that i would judge his family forever because of the sin he knew about his sons made themselves contemptible and he failed to restrain them therefore i swore to the house of eli the guilt of elis house will never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the lord he was afraid to tell eli the vision but eli called him and said samuel my son samuel answered here i am what was it he said to you eli asked do not hide it from me may god deal with you be it ever so severely if you hide from me anything he told you so samuel told him everything hiding nothing from him then eli said he is the lord let him do what is good in his eyes the lord was with samuel as he grew up and he let none of his words fall to the ground and all israel from dan to beersheba recognized that samuel was attested as a prophet of the lord the lord continued to appear at shiloh and there he revealed himself to samuel through his word and samuels word came to all israel now the israelites went out to fight against the philistines the israelites camped at ebenezer and the philistines at aphek the philistines deployed their forces to meet israel and as the battle spread israel was defeated by the philistines who killed about four thousand of them on the battlefield when the soldiers returned to camp the elders of israel asked why did the lord bring defeat upon us today before the philistines let us bring the ark of the lords covenant from shiloh so that it may go with us and save us from the hand of our enemies so the people sent men to shiloh and they brought back the ark of the covenant of the lord almighty who is enthroned between the cherubim and elis two sons hophni and phinehas were there with the ark of the covenant of god when the ark of the lords covenant came into the camp all israel raised such a great shout that the ground shook hearing the uproar the philistines asked whats all this shouting in the hebrew camp when they learned that the ark of the lord had come into the camp the philistines were afraid a god has come into the camp they said were in trouble nothing like this has happened before woe to us who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods they are the gods who struck the egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert be strong philistines be men or you will be subject to the hebrews as they have been to you be men and fight so the philistines fought and the israelites were defeated and every man fled to his tent the slaughter was very great israel lost thirty thousand foot soldiers the ark of god was captured and elis two sons hophni and phinehas died that same day a benjamite ran from the battle line and went to shiloh his clothes torn and dust on his head when he arrived there was eli sitting on his chair by the side of the road watching because his heart feared for the ark of god when the man entered the town and told what had happened the whole town sent up a cry eli heard the outcry and asked what is the meaning of this uproar the man hurried over to eli who was ninety eight years old and whose eyes were set so that he could not see he told eli i have just come from the battle line i fled from it this very day eli asked what happened my son the man who brought the news replied israel fled before the philistines and the army has suffered heavy losses also your two sons hophni and phinehas are dead and the ark of god has been captured when he mentioned the ark of god eli fell backward off his chair by the side of the gate his neck was broken and he died for he was an old man and heavy he had led israel forty years his daughter in law the wife of phinehas was pregnant and near the time of delivery when she heard the news that the ark of god had been captured and that her father in law and her husband were dead she went into labor and gave birth but was overcome by her labor pains as she was dying the women attending her said dont despair you have given birth to a son but she did not respond or pay any attention she named the boy ichabod saying the glory has departed from israel because of the capture of the ark of god and the deaths of her father in law and her husband she said the glory has departed from israel for the ark of god has been captured after the philistines had captured the ark of god they took it from ebenezer to ashdod then they carried the ark into dagons temple and set it beside dagon when the people of ashdod rose early the next day there was dagon fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the lord they took dagon and put him back in his place but the following morning when they rose there was dagon fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the lord his head and hands had been broken off and were lying on the threshold only his body remained that is why to this day neither the priests of dagon nor any others who enter dagons temple at ashdod step on the threshold the lords hand was heavy upon the people of ashdod and its vicinity he brought devastation upon them and afflicted them with tumors when the men of ashdod saw what was happening they said the ark of the god of israel must not stay here with us because his hand is heavy upon us and upon dagon our god so they called together all the rulers of the philistines and asked them what shall we do with the ark of the god of israel they answered have the ark of the god of israel moved to gath so they moved the ark of the god of israel but after they had moved it the lords hand was against that city throwing it into a great panic he afflicted the people of the city both young and old with an outbreak of tumors so they sent the ark of god to ekron as the ark of god was entering ekron the people of ekron cried out they have brought the ark of the god of israel around to us to kill us and our people so they called together all the rulers of the philistines and said send the ark of the god of israel away let it go back to its own place or it will kill us and our people for death had filled the city with panic gods hand was very heavy upon it those who did not die were afflicted with tumors and the outcry of the city went up to heaven when the ark of the lord had been in philistine territory seven months the philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said what shall we do with the ark of the lord tell us how we should send it back to its place they answered if you return the ark of the god of israel do not send it away empty but by all means send a guilt offering to him then you will be healed and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you the philistines asked what guilt offering should we send to him they replied five gold tumors and five gold rats according to the number of the philistine rulers because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country and pay honor to israels god perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land why do you harden your hearts as the egyptians and pharaoh did when he treated them harshly did they not send the israelites out so they could go on their way now then get a new cart ready with two cows that have calved and have never been yoked hitch the cows to the cart but take their calves away and pen them up take the ark of the lord and put it on the cart and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering send it on its way but keep watching it if it goes up to its own territory toward beth shemesh then the lord has brought this great disaster on us but if it does not then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us and that it happened to us by chance so they did this they took two such cows and hitched them to the cart and penned up their calves they placed the ark of the lord on the cart and along with it the chest containing the gold rats and the models of the tumors then the cows went straight up toward beth shemesh keeping on the road and lowing all the way they did not turn to the right or to the left the rulers of the philistines followed them as far as the border of beth shemesh now the people of beth shemesh were harvesting their wheat in the valley and when they looked up and saw the ark they rejoiced at the sight the cart came to the field of joshua of beth shemesh and there it stopped beside a large rock the people chopped up the wood of the cart and sacrificed the cows as a burnt offering to the lord the levites took down the ark of the lord together with the chest containing the gold objects and placed them on the large rock on that day the people of beth shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the lord the five rulers of the philistines saw all this and then returned that same day to ekron these are the gold tumors the philistines sent as a guilt offering to the lord one each for ashdod gaza ashkelon gath and ekron and the number of the gold rats was according to the number of philistine towns belonging to the five rulers the fortified towns with their country villages the large rock on which they set the ark of the lord is a witness to this day in the field of joshua of beth shemesh but god struck down some of the men of beth shemesh putting seventy of them to death because they had looked into the ark of the lord the people mourned because of the heavy blow the lord had dealt them and the men of beth shemesh asked who can stand in the presence of the lord this holy god to whom will the ark go up from here then they sent messengers to the people of kiriath jearim saying the philistines have returned the ark of the lord come down and take it up to your place so the men of kiriath jearim came and took up the ark of the lord they took it to abinadabs house on the hill and consecrated eleazar his son to guard the ark of the lord it was a long time twenty years in all that the ark remained at kiriath jearim and all the people of israel mourned and sought after the lord and samuel said to the whole house of israel if you are returning to the lord with all your hearts then rid yourselves of the foreign gods and the ashtoreths and commit yourselves to the lord and serve him only and he will deliver you out of the hand of the philistines so the israelites put away their baals and ashtoreths and served the lord only then samuel said assemble all israel at mizpah and i will intercede with the lord for you when they had assembled at mizpah they drew water and poured it out before the lord on that day they fasted and there they confessed we have sinned against the lord and samuel was leader of israel at mizpah when the philistines heard that israel had assembled at mizpah the rulers of the philistines came up to attack them and when the israelites heard of it they were afraid because of the philistines they said to samuel do not stop crying out to the lord our god for us that he may rescue us from the hand of the philistines then samuel took a suckling lamb and offered it up as a whole burnt offering to the lord he cried out to the lord on israels behalf and the lord answered him while samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering the philistines drew near to engage israel in battle but that day the lord thundered with loud thunder against the philistines and threw them into such a panic that they were routed before the israelites the men of israel rushed out of mizpah and pursued the philistines slaughtering them along the way to a point below beth car then samuel took a stone and set it up between mizpah and shen he named it ebenezer saying thus far has the lord helped us so the philistines were subdued and did not invade israelite territory again throughout samuels lifetime the hand of the lord was against the philistines the towns from ekron to gath that the philistines had captured from israel were restored to her and israel delivered the neighboring territory from the power of the philistines and there was peace between israel and the amorites samuel continued as judge over israel all the days of his life from year to year he went on a circuit from bethel to gilgal to mizpah judging israel in all those places but he always went back to ramah where his home was and there he also judged israel and he built an altar there to the lord when samuel grew old he appointed his sons as judges for israel the name of his firstborn was joel and the name of his second was abijah and they served at beersheba but his sons did not walk in his ways they turned aside after dishonest gain and accepted bribes and perverted justice so all the elders of israel gathered together and came to samuel at ramah they said to him you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways now appoint a king to lead us such as all the other nations have but when they said give us a king to lead us this displeased samuel so he prayed to the lord and the lord told him listen to all that the people are saying to you it is not you they have rejected but they have rejected me as their king as they have done from the day i brought them up out of egypt until this day forsaking me and serving other gods so they are doing to you now listen to them but warn them solemnly and let them know what the king who will reign over them will do samuel told all the words of the lord to the people who were asking him for a king he said this is what the king who will reign over you will do he will take your sons and make them serve with his chariots and horses and they will run in front of his chariots some he will assign to be commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties and others to plow his ground and reap his harvest and still others to make weapons of war and equipment for his chariots he will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers he will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his attendants he will take a tenth of your grain and of your vintage and give it to his officials and attendants your menservants and maidservants and the best of your cattle and donkeys he will take for his own use he will take a tenth of your flocks and you yourselves will become his slaves when that day comes you will cry out for relief from the king you have chosen and the lord will not answer you in that day but the people refused to listen to samuel no they said we want a king over us then we will be like all the other nations with a king to lead us and to go out before us and fight our battles when samuel heard all that the people said he repeated it before the lord the lord answered listen to them and give them a king then samuel said to the men of israel everyone go back to his town there was a benjamite a man of standing whose name was kish son of abiel the son of zeror the son of becorath the son of aphiah of benjamin he had a son named saul an impressive young man without equal among the israelites a head taller than any of the others now the donkeys belonging to sauls father kish were lost and kish said to his son saul take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys so he passed through the hill country of ephraim and through the area around shalisha but they did not find them they went on into the district of shaalim but the donkeys were not there then he passed through the territory of benjamin but they did not find them when they reached the district of zuph saul said to the servant who was with him come lets go back or my father will stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us but the servant replied look in this town there is a man of god he is highly respected and everything he says comes true lets go there now perhaps he will tell us what way to take saul said to his servant if we go what can we give the man the food in our sacks is gone we have no gift to take to the man of god what do we have the servant answered him again look he said i have a quarter of a shekel of silver i will give it to the man of god so that he will tell us what way to take formerly in israel if a man went to inquire of god he would say come let us go to the seer because the prophet of today used to be called a seer good saul said to his servant come lets go so they set out for the town where the man of god was as they were going up the hill to the town they met some girls coming out to draw water and they asked them is the seer here he is they answered hes ahead of you hurry now he has just come to our town today for the people have a sacrifice at the high place as soon as you enter the town you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat the people will not begin eating until he comes because he must bless the sacrifice afterward those who are invited will eat go up now you should find him about this time they went up to the town and as they were entering it there was samuel coming toward them on his way up to the high place now the day before saul came the lord had revealed this to samuel about this time tomorrow i will send you a man from the land of benjamin anoint him leader over my people israel he will deliver my people from the hand of the philistines i have looked upon my people for their cry has reached me when samuel caught sight of saul the lord said to him this is the man i spoke to you about he will govern my people saul approached samuel in the gateway and asked would you please tell me where the seers house is i am the seer samuel replied go up ahead of me to the high place for today you are to eat with me and in the morning i will let you go and will tell you all that is in your heart as for the donkeys you lost three days ago do not worry about them they have been found and to whom is all the desire of israel turned if not to you and all your fathers family saul answered but am i not a benjamite from the smallest tribe of israel and is not my clan the least of all the clans of the tribe of benjamin why do you say such a thing to me then samuel brought saul and his servant into the hall and seated them at the head of those who were invited about thirty in number samuel said to the cook bring the piece of meat i gave you the one i told you to lay aside so the cook took up the leg with what was on it and set it in front of saul samuel said here is what has been kept for you eat because it was set aside for you for this occasion from the time i said i have invited guests and saul dined with samuel that day after they came down from the high place to the town samuel talked with saul on the roof of his house they rose about daybreak and samuel called to saul on the roof get ready and i will send you on your way when saul got ready he and samuel went outside together as they were going down to the edge of the town samuel said to saul tell the servant to go on ahead of us and the servant did so but you stay here awhile so that i may give you a message from god then samuel took a flask of oil and poured it on sauls head and kissed him saying has not the lord anointed you leader over his inheritance when you leave me today you will meet two men near rachels tomb at zelzah on the border of benjamin they will say to you the donkeys you set out to look for have been found and now your father has stopped thinking about them and is worried about you he is asking what shall i do about my son then you will go on from there until you reach the great tree of tabor three men going up to god at bethel will meet you there one will be carrying three young goats another three loaves of bread and another a skin of wine they will greet you and offer you two loaves of bread which you will accept from them after that you will go to gibeah of god where there is a philistine outpost as you approach the town you will meet a procession of prophets coming down from the high place with lyres tambourines flutes and harps being played before them and they will be prophesying the spirit of the lord will come upon you in power and you will prophesy with them and you will be changed into a different person once these signs are fulfilled do whatever your hand finds to do for god is with you go down ahead of me to gilgal i will surely come down to you to sacrifice burnt offerings and fellowship offerings but you must wait seven days until i come to you and tell you what you are to do as saul turned to leave samuel god changed sauls heart and all these signs were fulfilled that day when they arrived at gibeah a procession of prophets met him the spirit of god came upon him in power and he joined in their prophesying when all those who had formerly known him saw him prophesying with the prophets they asked each other what is this that has happened to the son of kish is saul also among the prophets a man who lived there answered and who is their father so it became a saying is saul also among the prophets after saul stopped prophesying he went to the high place now sauls uncle asked him and his servant where have you beenlooking for the donkeys he said but when we saw they were not to be found we went to samuel sauls uncle said tell me what samuel said to you saul replied he assured us that the donkeys had been found but he did not tell his uncle what samuel had said about the kingship samuel summoned the people of israel to the lord at mizpah and said to them this is what the lord the god of israel says i brought israel up out of egypt and i delivered you from the power of egypt and all the kingdoms that oppressed you but you have now rejected your god who saves you out of all your calamities and distresses and you have said no set a king over us so now present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and clans when samuel brought all the tribes of israel near the tribe of benjamin was chosen then he brought forward the tribe of benjamin clan by clan and matris clan was chosen finally saul son of kish was chosen but when they looked for him he was not to be found so they inquired further of the lord has the man come here yet and the lord said yes he has hidden himself among the baggage they ran and brought him out and as he stood among the people he was a head taller than any of the others samuel said to all the people do you see the man the lord has chosen there is no one like him among all the people then the people shouted long live the king samuel explained to the people the regulations of the kingship he wrote them down on a scroll and deposited it before the lord then samuel dismissed the people each to his own home saul also went to his home in gibeah accompanied by valiant men whose hearts god had touched but some troublemakers said how can this fellow save us they despised him and brought him no gifts but saul kept silent nahash the ammonite went up and besieged jabesh gilead and all the men of jabesh said to him make a treaty with us and we will be subject to you but nahash the ammonite replied i will make a treaty with you only on the condition that i gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all israel the elders of jabesh said to him give us seven days so we can send messengers throughout israel if no one comes to rescue us we will surrender to you when the messengers came to gibeah of saul and reported these terms to the people they all wept aloud just then saul was returning from the fields behind his oxen and he asked what is wrong with the people why are they weeping then they repeated to him what the men of jabesh had said when saul heard their words the spirit of god came upon him in power and he burned with anger he took a pair of oxen cut them into pieces and sent the pieces by messengers throughout israel proclaiming this is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not follow saul and samuel then the terror of the lord fell on the people and they turned out as one man when saul mustered them at bezek the men of israel numbered three hundred thousand and the men of judah thirty thousand they told the messengers who had come say to the men of jabesh gilead by the time the sun is hot tomorrow you will be delivered when the messengers went and reported this to the men of jabesh they were elated they said to the ammonites tomorrow we will surrender to you and you can do to us whatever seems good to you the next day saul separated his men into three divisions during the last watch of the night they broke into the camp of the ammonites and slaughtered them until the heat of the day those who survived were scattered so that no two of them were left together the people then said to samuel who was it that asked shall saul reign over us bring these men to us and we will put them to death but saul said no one shall be put to death today for this day the lord has rescued israel then samuel said to the people come let us go to gilgal and there reaffirm the kingship so all the people went to gilgal and confirmed saul as king in the presence of the lord there they sacrificed fellowship offerings before the lord and saul and all the israelites held a great celebration samuel said to all israel i have listened to everything you said to me and have set a king over you now you have a king as your leader as for me i am old and gray and my sons are here with you i have been your leader from my youth until this day here i stand testify against me in the presence of the lord and his anointed whose ox have i taken whose donkey have i taken whom have i cheated whom have i oppressed from whose hand have i accepted a bribe to make me shut my eyes if i have done any of these i will make it right you have not cheated or oppressed us they replied you have not taken anything from anyones hand samuel said to them the lord is witness against you and also his anointed is witness this day that you have not found anything in my handhe is witness they said then samuel said to the people it is the lord who appointed moses and aaron and brought your forefathers up out of egypt now then stand here because i am going to confront you with evidence before the lord as to all the righteous acts performed by the lord for you and your fathers after jacob entered egypt they cried to the lord for help and the lord sent moses and aaron who brought your forefathers out of egypt and settled them in this place but they forgot the lord their god so he sold them into the hand of sisera the commander of the army of hazor and into the hands of the philistines and the king of moab who fought against them they cried out to the lord and said we have sinned we have forsaken the lord and served the baals and the ashtoreths but now deliver us from the hands of our enemies and we will serve you then the lord sent jerub baal barak jephthah and samuel and he delivered you from the hands of your enemies on every side so that you lived securely but when you saw that nahash king of the ammonites was moving against you you said to me no we want a king to rule over us even though the lord your god was your king now here is the king you have chosen the one you asked for see the lord has set a king over you if you fear the lord and serve and obey him and do not rebel against his commands and if both you and the king who reigns over you follow the lord your god good but if you do not obey the lord and if you rebel against his commands his hand will be against you as it was against your fathers now then stand still and see this great thing the lord is about to do before your eyes is it not wheat harvest now i will call upon the lord to send thunder and rain and you will realize what an evil thing you did in the eyes of the lord when you asked for a king then samuel called upon the lord and that same day the lord sent thunder and rain so all the people stood in awe of the lord and of samuel the people all said to samuel pray to the lord your god for your servants so that we will not die for we have added to all our other sins the evil of asking for a king do not be afraid samuel replied you have done all this evil yet do not turn away from the lord but serve the lord with all your heart do not turn away after useless idols they can do you no good nor can they rescue you because they are useless for the sake of his great name the lord will not reject his people because the lord was pleased to make you his own as for me far be it from me that i should sin against the lord by failing to pray for you and i will teach you the way that is good and right but be sure to fear the lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart consider what great things he has done for you yet if you persist in doing evil both you and your king will be swept away saul was thirty years old when he became king and he reigned over israel forty two years saul chose three thousand men from israel two thousand were with him at micmash and in the hill country of bethel and a thousand were with jonathan at gibeah in benjamin the rest of the men he sent back to their homes jonathan attacked the philistine outpost at geba and the philistines heard about it then saul had the trumpet blown throughout the land and said let the hebrews hear so all israel heard the news saul has attacked the philistine outpost and now israel has become a stench to the philistines and the people were summoned to join saul at gilgal the philistines assembled to fight israel with three thousand chariots six thousand charioteers and soldiers as numerous as the sand on the seashore they went up and camped at micmash east of beth aven when the men of israel saw that their situation was critical and that their army was hard pressed they hid in caves and thickets among the rocks and in pits and cisterns some hebrews even crossed the jordan to the land of gad and gilead saul remained at gilgal and all the troops with him were quaking with fear he waited seven days the time set by samuel but samuel did not come to gilgal and sauls men began to scatter so he said bring me the burnt offering and the fellowship offerings and saul offered up the burnt offering just as he finished making the offering samuel arrived and saul went out to greet him what have you done asked samuel saul replied when i saw that the men were scattering and that you did not come at the set time and that the philistines were assembling at micmash i thought now the philistines will come down against me at gilgal and i have not sought the lords favor so i felt compelled to offer the burnt offering you acted foolishly samuel said you have not kept the command the lord your god gave you if you had he would have established your kingdom over israel for all time but now your kingdom will not endure the lord has sought out a man after his own heart and appointed him leader of his people because you have not kept the lords command then samuel left gilgal and went up to gibeah in benjamin and saul counted the men who were with him they numbered about six hundred saul and his son jonathan and the men with them were staying in gibeah in benjamin while the philistines camped at micmash raiding parties went out from the philistine camp in three detachments one turned toward ophrah in the vicinity of shual another toward beth horon and the third toward the borderland overlooking the valley of zeboim facing the desert not a blacksmith could be found in the whole land of israel because the philistines had said otherwise the hebrews will make swords or spears so all israel went down to the philistines to have their plowshares mattocks axes and sickles sharpened the price was two thirds of a shekel for sharpening plowshares and mattocks and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and for repointing goads so on the day of the battle not a soldier with saul and jonathan had a sword or spear in his hand only saul and his son jonathan had them now a detachment of philistines had gone out to the pass at micmash one day jonathan son of saul said to the young man bearing his armor come lets go over to the philistine outpost on the other side but he did not tell his father saul was staying on the outskirts of gibeah under a pomegranate tree in migron with him were about six hundred men among whom was ahijah who was wearing an ephod he was a son of ichabods brother ahitub son of phinehas the son of eli the lords priest in shiloh no one was aware that jonathan had left on each side of the pass that jonathan intended to cross to reach the philistine outpost was a cliff one was called bozez and the other seneh one cliff stood to the north toward micmash the other to the south toward geba jonathan said to his young armor bearer come lets go over to the outpost of those uncircumcised fellows perhaps the lord will act in our behalf nothing can hinder the lord from saving whether by many or by few do all that you have in mind his armor bearer said go ahead i am with you heart and soul jonathan said come then we will cross over toward the men and let them see us if they say to us wait there until we come to you we will stay where we are and not go up to them but if they say come up to us we will climb up because that will be our sign that the lord has given them into our hands so both of them showed themselves to the philistine outpost look said the philistines the hebrews are crawling out of the holes they were hiding in the men of the outpost shouted to jonathan and his armor bearer come up to us and well teach you a lesson so jonathan said to his armor bearer climb up after me the lord has given them into the hand of israel jonathan climbed up using his hands and feet with his armor bearer right behind him the philistines fell before jonathan and his armor bearer followed and killed behind him in that first attack jonathan and his armor bearer killed some twenty men in an area of about half an acre then panic struck the whole army those in the camp and field and those in the outposts and raiding parties and the ground shook it was a panic sent by god sauls lookouts at gibeah in benjamin saw the army melting away in all directions then saul said to the men who were with him muster the forces and see who has left us when they did it was jonathan and his armor bearer who were not there saul said to ahijah bring the ark of god at that time it was with the israelites while saul was talking to the priest the tumult in the philistine camp increased more and more so saul said to the priest withdraw your hand then saul and all his men assembled and went to the battle they found the philistines in total confusion striking each other with their swords those hebrews who had previously been with the philistines and had gone up with them to their camp went over to the israelites who were with saul and jonathan when all the israelites who had hidden in the hill country of ephraim heard that the philistines were on the run they joined the battle in hot pursuit so the lord rescued israel that day and the battle moved on beyond beth aven now the men of israel were in distress that day because saul had bound the people under an oath saying cursed be any man who eats food before evening comes before i have avenged myself on my enemies so none of the troops tasted food the entire army entered the woods and there was honey on the ground when they went into the woods they saw the honey oozing out yet no one put his hand to his mouth because they feared the oath but jonathan had not heard that his father had bound the people with the oath so he reached out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into the honeycomb he raised his hand to his mouth and his eyes brightened then one of the soldiers told him your father bound the army under a strict oath saying cursed be any man who eats food today that is why the men are faint jonathan said my father has made trouble for the country see how my eyes brightened when i tasted a little of this honey how much better it would have been if the men had eaten today some of the plunder they took from their enemies would not the slaughter of the philistines have been even greater that day after the israelites had struck down the philistines from micmash to aijalon they were exhausted they pounced on the plunder and taking sheep cattle and calves they butchered them on the ground and ate them together with the blood then someone said to saul look the men are sinning against the lord by eating meat that has blood in ityou have broken faith he said roll a large stone over here at once then he said go out among the men and tell them each of you bring me your cattle and sheep and slaughter them here and eat them do not sin against the lord by eating meat with blood still in it so everyone brought his ox that night and slaughtered it there then saul built an altar to the lord it was the first time he had done this saul said let us go down after the philistines by night and plunder them till dawn and let us not leave one of them alivedo whatever seems best to you they replied but the priest said let us inquire of god here so saul asked god shall i go down after the philistines will you give them into israels hand but god did not answer him that day saul therefore said come here all you who are leaders of the army and let us find out what sin has been committed today as surely as the lord who rescues israel lives even if it lies with my son jonathan he must die but not one of the men said a word saul then said to all the israelites you stand over there i and jonathan my son will stand over heredo what seems best to you the men replied then saul prayed to the lord the god of israel give me the right answer and jonathan and saul were taken by lot and the men were cleared saul said cast the lot between me and jonathan my son and jonathan was taken then saul said to jonathan tell me what you have done so jonathan told him i merely tasted a little honey with the end of my staff and now must i die saul said may god deal with me be it ever so severely if you do not die jonathan but the men said to saul should jonathan die he who has brought about this great deliverance in israel never as surely as the lord lives not a hair of his head will fall to the ground for he did this today with gods help so the men rescued jonathan and he was not put to death then saul stopped pursuing the philistines and they withdrew to their own land after saul had assumed rule over israel he fought against their enemies on every side moab the ammonites edom the kings of zobah and the philistines wherever he turned he inflicted punishment on them he fought valiantly and defeated the amalekites delivering israel from the hands of those who had plundered them sauls sons were jonathan ishvi and malki shua the name of his older daughter was merab and that of the younger was michal his wifes name was ahinoam daughter of ahimaaz the name of the commander of sauls army was abner son of ner and ner was sauls uncle sauls father kish and abners father ner were sons of abiel all the days of saul there was bitter war with the philistines and whenever saul saw a mighty or brave man he took him into his service samuel said to saul i am the one the lord sent to anoint you king over his people israel so listen now to the message from the lord this is what the lord almighty says i will punish the amalekites for what they did to israel when they waylaid them as they came up from egypt now go attack the amalekites and totally destroy everything that belongs to them do not spare them put to death men and women children and infants cattle and sheep camels and donkeys so saul summoned the men and mustered them at telaim two hundred thousand foot soldiers and ten thousand men from judah saul went to the city of amalek and set an ambush in the ravine then he said to the kenites go away leave the amalekites so that i do not destroy you along with them for you showed kindness to all the israelites when they came up out of egypt so the kenites moved away from the amalekites then saul attacked the amalekites all the way from havilah to shur to the east of egypt he took agag king of the amalekites alive and all his people he totally destroyed with the sword but saul and the army spared agag and the best of the sheep and cattle the fat calves and lambs everything that was good these they were unwilling to destroy completely but everything that was despised and weak they totally destroyed then the word of the lord came to samuel i am grieved that i have made saul king because he has turned away from me and has not carried out my instructions samuel was troubled and he cried out to the lord all that night early in the morning samuel got up and went to meet saul but he was told saul has gone to carmel there he has set up a monument in his own honor and has turned and gone on down to gilgal when samuel reached him saul said the lord bless you i have carried out the lords instructions but samuel said what then is this bleating of sheep in my ears what is this lowing of cattle that i hear saul answered the soldiers brought them from the amalekites they spared the best of the sheep and cattle to sacrifice to the lord your god but we totally destroyed the rest stop samuel said to saul let me tell you what the lord said to me last nighttell me saul replied samuel said although you were once small in your own eyes did you not become the head of the tribes of israel the lord anointed you king over israel and he sent you on a mission saying go and completely destroy those wicked people the amalekites make war on them until you have wiped them out why did you not obey the lord why did you pounce on the plunder and do evil in the eyes of the lord but i did obey the lord saul said i went on the mission the lord assigned me i completely destroyed the amalekites and brought back agag their king the soldiers took sheep and cattle from the plunder the best of what was devoted to god in order to sacrifice them to the lord your god at gilgal but samuel replied does the lord delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying the voice of the lord to obey is better than sacrifice and to heed is better than the fat of rams for rebellion is like the sin of divination and arrogance like the evil of idolatry because you have rejected the word of the lord he has rejected you as king then saul said to samuel i have sinned i violated the lords command and your instructions i was afraid of the people and so i gave in to them now i beg you forgive my sin and come back with me so that i may worship the lord but samuel said to him i will not go back with you you have rejected the word of the lord and the lord has rejected you as king over israel as samuel turned to leave saul caught hold of the hem of his robe and it tore samuel said to him the lord has torn the kingdom of israel from you today and has given it to one of your neighbors to one better than you he who is the glory of israel does not lie or change his mind for he is not a man that he should change his mind saul replied i have sinned but please honor me before the elders of my people and before israel come back with me so that i may worship the lord your god so samuel went back with saul and saul worshiped the lord then samuel said bring me agag king of the amalekites agag came to him confidently thinking surely the bitterness of death is past but samuel said as your sword has made women childless so will your mother be childless among women and samuel put agag to death before the lord at gilgal then samuel left for ramah but saul went up to his home in gibeah of saul until the day samuel died he did not go to see saul again though samuel mourned for him and the lord was grieved that he had made saul king over israel the lord said to samuel how long will you mourn for saul since i have rejected him as king over israel fill your horn with oil and be on your way i am sending you to jesse of bethlehem i have chosen one of his sons to be king but samuel said how can i go saul will hear about it and kill me the lord said take a heifer with you and say i have come to sacrifice to the lord invite jesse to the sacrifice and i will show you what to do you are to anoint for me the one i indicate samuel did what the lord said when he arrived at bethlehem the elders of the town trembled when they met him they asked do you come in peace samuel replied yes in peace i have come to sacrifice to the lord consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me then he consecrated jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice when they arrived samuel saw eliab and thought surely the lords anointed stands here before the lord but the lord said to samuel do not consider his appearance or his height for i have rejected him the lord does not look at the things man looks at man looks at the outward appearance but the lord looks at the heart then jesse called abinadab and had him pass in front of samuel but samuel said the lord has not chosen this one either jesse then had shammah pass by but samuel said nor has the lord chosen this one jesse had seven of his sons pass before samuel but samuel said to him the lord has not chosen these so he asked jesse are these all the sons you havethere is still the youngest jesse answered but he is tending the sheep samuel said send for him we will not sit down until he arrives so he sent and had him brought in he was ruddy with a fine appearance and handsome features then the lord said rise and anoint him he is the one so samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers and from that day on the spirit of the lord came upon david in power samuel then went to ramah now the spirit of the lord had departed from saul and an evil spirit from the lord tormented him sauls attendants said to him see an evil spirit from god is tormenting you let our lord command his servants here to search for someone who can play the harp he will play when the evil spirit from god comes upon you and you will feel better so saul said to his attendants find someone who plays well and bring him to me one of the servants answered i have seen a son of jesse of bethlehem who knows how to play the harp he is a brave man and a warrior he speaks well and is a fine looking man and the lord is with him then saul sent messengers to jesse and said send me your son david who is with the sheep so jesse took a donkey loaded with bread a skin of wine and a young goat and sent them with his son david to saul david came to saul and entered his service saul liked him very much and david became one of his armor bearers then saul sent word to jesse saying allow david to remain in my service for i am pleased with him whenever the spirit from god came upon saul david would take his harp and play then relief would come to saul he would feel better and the evil spirit would leave him now the philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at socoh in judah they pitched camp at ephes dammim between socoh and azekah saul and the israelites assembled and camped in the valley of elah and drew up their battle line to meet the philistines the philistines occupied one hill and the israelites another with the valley between them a champion named goliath who was from gath came out of the philistine camp he was over nine feet tall he had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels on his legs he wore bronze greaves and a bronze javelin was slung on his back his spear shaft was like a weavers rod and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels his shield bearer went ahead of him goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of israel why do you come out and line up for battle am i not a philistine and are you not the servants of saul choose a man and have him come down to me if he is able to fight and kill me we will become your subjects but if i overcome him and kill him you will become our subjects and serve us then the philistine said this day i defy the ranks of israel give me a man and let us fight each other on hearing the philistines words saul and all the israelites were dismayed and terrified now david was the son of an ephrathite named jesse who was from bethlehem in judah jesse had eight sons and in sauls time he was old and well advanced in years jesses three oldest sons had followed saul to the war the firstborn was eliab the second abinadab and the third shammah david was the youngest the three oldest followed saul but david went back and forth from saul to tend his fathers sheep at bethlehem for forty days the philistine came forward every morning and evening and took his stand now jesse said to his son david take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp take along these ten cheeses to the commander of their unit see how your brothers are and bring back some assurance from them they are with saul and all the men of israel in the valley of elah fighting against the philistines early in the morning david left the flock with a shepherd loaded up and set out as jesse had directed he reached the camp as the army was going out to its battle positions shouting the war cry israel and the philistines were drawing up their lines facing each other david left his things with the keeper of supplies ran to the battle lines and greeted his brothers as he was talking with them goliath the philistine champion from gath stepped out from his lines and shouted his usual defiance and david heard it when the israelites saw the man they all ran from him in great fear now the israelites had been saying do you see how this man keeps coming out he comes out to defy israel the king will give great wealth to the man who kills him he will also give him his daughter in marriage and will exempt his fathers family from taxes in israel david asked the men standing near him what will be done for the man who kills this philistine and removes this disgrace from israel who is this uncircumcised philistine that he should defy the armies of the living god they repeated to him what they had been saying and told him this is what will be done for the man who kills him when eliab davids oldest brother heard him speaking with the men he burned with anger at him and asked why have you come down here and with whom did you leave those few sheep in the desert i know how conceited you are and how wicked your heart is you came down only to watch the battle now what have i done said david cant i even speak he then turned away to someone else and brought up the same matter and the men answered him as before what david said was overheard and reported to saul and saul sent for him david said to saul let no one lose heart on account of this philistine your servant will go and fight him saul replied you are not able to go out against this philistine and fight him you are only a boy and he has been a fighting man from his youth but david said to saul your servant has been keeping his fathers sheep when a lion or a bear came and carried off a sheep from the flock i went after it struck it and rescued the sheep from its mouth when it turned on me i seized it by its hair struck it and killed it your servant has killed both the lion and the bear this uncircumcised philistine will be like one of them because he has defied the armies of the living god the lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear will deliver me from the hand of this philistine saul said to david go and the lord be with you then saul dressed david in his own tunic he put a coat of armor on him and a bronze helmet on his head david fastened on his sword over the tunic and tried walking around because he was not used to them i cannot go in these he said to saul because i am not used to them so he took them off then he took his staff in his hand chose five smooth stones from the stream put them in the pouch of his shepherds bag and with his sling in his hand approached the philistine meanwhile the philistine with his shield bearer in front of him kept coming closer to david he looked david over and saw that he was only a boy ruddy and handsome and he despised him he said to david am i a dog that you come at me with sticks and the philistine cursed david by his gods come here he said and ill give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field david said to the philistine you come against me with sword and spear and javelin but i come against you in the name of the lord almighty the god of the armies of israel whom you have defied this day the lord will hand you over to me and ill strike you down and cut off your head today i will give the carcasses of the philistine army to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth and the whole world will know that there is a god in israel all those gathered here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the lord saves for the battle is the lords and he will give all of you into our hands as the philistine moved closer to attack him david ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him reaching into his bag and taking out a stone he slung it and struck the philistine on the forehead the stone sank into his forehead and he fell facedown on the ground so david triumphed over the philistine with a sling and a stone without a sword in his hand he struck down the philistine and killed him david ran and stood over him he took hold of the philistines sword and drew it from the scabbard after he killed him he cut off his head with the sword when the philistines saw that their hero was dead they turned and ran then the men of israel and judah surged forward with a shout and pursued the philistines to the entrance of gath and to the gates of ekron their dead were strewn along the shaaraim road to gath and ekron when the israelites returned from chasing the philistines they plundered their camp david took the philistines head and brought it to jerusalem and he put the philistines weapons in his own tent as saul watched david going out to meet the philistine he said to abner commander of the army abner whose son is that young man abner replied as surely as you live o king i dont know the king said find out whose son this young man is as soon as david returned from killing the philistine abner took him and brought him before saul with david still holding the philistines head whose son are you young man saul asked him david said i am the son of your servant jesse of bethlehem after david had finished talking with saul jonathan became one in spirit with david and he loved him as himself from that day saul kept david with him and did not let him return to his fathers house and jonathan made a covenant with david because he loved him as himself jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to david along with his tunic and even his sword his bow and his belt whatever saul sent him to do david did it so successfully that saul gave him a high rank in the army this pleased all the people and sauls officers as well when the men were returning home after david had killed the philistine the women came out from all the towns of israel to meet king saul with singing and dancing with joyful songs and with tambourines and lutes as they danced they sang saul has slain his thousands and david his tens of thousands saul was very angry this refrain galled him they have credited david with tens of thousands he thought but me with only thousands what more can he get but the kingdom and from that time on saul kept a jealous eye on david the next day an evil spirit from god came forcefully upon saul he was prophesying in his house while david was playing the harp as he usually did saul had a spear in his hand and he hurled it saying to himself ill pin david to the wall but david eluded him twice saul was afraid of david because the lord was with david but had left saul so he sent david away from him and gave him command over a thousand men and david led the troops in their campaigns in everything he did he had great success because the lord was with him when saul saw how successful he was he was afraid of him but all israel and judah loved david because he led them in their campaigns saul said to david here is my older daughter merab i will give her to you in marriage only serve me bravely and fight the battles of the lord for saul said to himself i will not raise a hand against him let the philistines do that but david said to saul who am i and what is my family or my fathers clan in israel that i should become the kings son in law so when the time came for merab sauls daughter to be given to david she was given in marriage to adriel of meholah now sauls daughter michal was in love with david and when they told saul about it he was pleased i will give her to him he thought so that she may be a snare to him and so that the hand of the philistines may be against him so saul said to david now you have a second opportunity to become my son in law then saul ordered his attendants speak to david privately and say look the king is pleased with you and his attendants all like you now become his son in law they repeated these words to david but david said do you think it is a small matter to become the kings son in law im only a poor man and little known when sauls servants told him what david had said saul replied say to david the king wants no other price for the bride than a hundred philistine foreskins to take revenge on his enemies sauls plan was to have david fall by the hands of the philistines when the attendants told david these things he was pleased to become the kings son in law so before the allotted time elapsed david and his men went out and killed two hundred philistines he brought their foreskins and presented the full number to the king so that he might become the kings son in law then saul gave him his daughter michal in marriage when saul realized that the lord was with david and that his daughter michal loved david saul became still more afraid of him and he remained his enemy the rest of his days the philistine commanders continued to go out to battle and as often as they did david met with more success than the rest of sauls officers and his name became well known saul told his son jonathan and all the attendants to kill david but jonathan was very fond of david and warned him my father saul is looking for a chance to kill you be on your guard tomorrow morning go into hiding and stay there i will go out and stand with my father in the field where you are ill speak to him about you and will tell you what i find out jonathan spoke well of david to saul his father and said to him let not the king do wrong to his servant david he has not wronged you and what he has done has benefited you greatly he took his life in his hands when he killed the philistine the lord won a great victory for all israel and you saw it and were glad why then would you do wrong to an innocent man like david by killing him for no reason saul listened to jonathan and took this oath as surely as the lord lives david will not be put to death so jonathan called david and told him the whole conversation he brought him to saul and david was with saul as before once more war broke out and david went out and fought the philistines he struck them with such force that they fled before him but an evil spirit from the lord came upon saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand while david was playing the harp saul tried to pin him to the wall with his spear but david eluded him as saul drove the spear into the wall that night david made good his escape saul sent men to davids house to watch it and to kill him in the morning but michal davids wife warned him if you dont run for your life tonight tomorrow youll be killed so michal let david down through a window and he fled and escaped then michal took an idol and laid it on the bed covering it with a garment and putting some goats hair at the head when saul sent the men to capture david michal said he is ill then saul sent the men back to see david and told them bring him up to me in his bed so that i may kill him but when the men entered there was the idol in the bed and at the head was some goats hair saul said to michal why did you deceive me like this and send my enemy away so that he escaped michal told him he said to me let me get away why should i kill you when david had fled and made his escape he went to samuel at ramah and told him all that saul had done to him then he and samuel went to naioth and stayed there word came to saul david is in naioth at ramah so he sent men to capture him but when they saw a group of prophets prophesying with samuel standing there as their leader the spirit of god came upon sauls men and they also prophesied saul was told about it and he sent more men and they prophesied too saul sent men a third time and they also prophesied finally he himself left for ramah and went to the great cistern at secu and he asked where are samuel and davidover in naioth at ramah they said so saul went to naioth at ramah but the spirit of god came even upon him and he walked along prophesying until he came to naioth he stripped off his robes and also prophesied in samuels presence he lay that way all that day and night this is why people say is saul also among the prophets then david fled from naioth at ramah and went to jonathan and asked what have i done what is my crime how have i wronged your father that he is trying to take my life never jonathan replied you are not going to die look my father doesnt do anything great or small without confiding in me why would he hide this from me its not so but david took an oath and said your father knows very well that i have found favor in your eyes and he has said to himself jonathan must not know this or he will be grieved yet as surely as the lord lives and as you live there is only a step between me and death jonathan said to david whatever you want me to do ill do for you so david said look tomorrow is the new moon festival and i am supposed to dine with the king but let me go and hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow if your father misses me at all tell him david earnestly asked my permission to hurry to bethlehem his hometown because an annual sacrifice is being made there for his whole clan if he says very well then your servant is safe but if he loses his temper you can be sure that he is determined to harm me as for you show kindness to your servant for you have brought him into a covenant with you before the lord if i am guilty then kill me yourself why hand me over to your father never jonathan said if i had the least inkling that my father was determined to harm you wouldnt i tell you david asked who will tell me if your father answers you harshly come jonathan said lets go out into the field so they went there together then jonathan said to david by the lord the god of israel i will surely sound out my father by this time the day after tomorrow if he is favorably disposed toward you will i not send you word and let you know but if my father is inclined to harm you may the lord deal with me be it ever so severely if i do not let you know and send you away safely may the lord be with you as he has been with my father but show me unfailing kindness like that of the lord as long as i live so that i may not be killed and do not ever cut off your kindness from my family not even when the lord has cut off every one of davids enemies from the face of the earth so jonathan made a covenant with the house of david saying may the lord call davids enemies to account and jonathan had david reaffirm his oath out of love for him because he loved him as he loved himself then jonathan said to david tomorrow is the new moon festival you will be missed because your seat will be empty the day after tomorrow toward evening go to the place where you hid when this trouble began and wait by the stone ezel i will shoot three arrows to the side of it as though i were shooting at a target then i will send a boy and say go find the arrows if i say to him look the arrows are on this side of you bring them here then come because as surely as the lord lives you are safe there is no danger but if i say to the boy look the arrows are beyond you then you must go because the lord has sent you away and about the matter you and i discussed remember the lord is witness between you and me forever so david hid in the field and when the new moon festival came the king sat down to eat he sat in his customary place by the wall opposite jonathan and abner sat next to saul but davids place was empty saul said nothing that day for he thought something must have happened to david to make him ceremonially unclean surely he is unclean but the next day the second day of the month davids place was empty again then saul said to his son jonathan why hasnt the son of jesse come to the meal either yesterday or today jonathan answered david earnestly asked me for permission to go to bethlehem he said let me go because our family is observing a sacrifice in the town and my brother has ordered me to be there if i have found favor in your eyes let me get away to see my brothers that is why he has not come to the kings table sauls anger flared up at jonathan and he said to him you son of a perverse and rebellious woman dont i know that you have sided with the son of jesse to your own shame and to the shame of the mother who bore you as long as the son of jesse lives on this earth neither you nor your kingdom will be established now send and bring him to me for he must die why should he be put to death what has he done jonathan asked his father but saul hurled his spear at him to kill him then jonathan knew that his father intended to kill david jonathan got up from the table in fierce anger on that second day of the month he did not eat because he was grieved at his fathers shameful treatment of david in the morning jonathan went out to the field for his meeting with david he had a small boy with him and he said to the boy run and find the arrows i shoot as the boy ran he shot an arrow beyond him when the boy came to the place where jonathans arrow had fallen jonathan called out after him isnt the arrow beyond you then he shouted hurry go quickly dont stop the boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master the boy knew nothing of all this only jonathan and david knew then jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and said go carry them back to town after the boy had gone david got up from the south side of the stone and bowed down before jonathan three times with his face to the ground then they kissed each other and wept together but david wept the most jonathan said to david go in peace for we have sworn friendship with each other in the name of the lord saying the lord is witness between you and me and between your descendants and my descendants forever then david left and jonathan went back to the town david went to nob to ahimelech the priest ahimelech trembled when he met him and asked why are you alone why is no one with you david answered ahimelech the priest the king charged me with a certain matter and said to me no one is to know anything about your mission and your instructions as for my men i have told them to meet me at a certain place now then what do you have on hand give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find but the priest answered david i dont have any ordinary bread on hand however there is some consecrated bread here provided the men have kept themselves from women david replied indeed women have been kept from us as usual whenever i set out the mens things are holy even on missions that are not holy how much more so today so the priest gave him the consecrated bread since there was no bread there except the bread of the presence that had been removed from before the lord and replaced by hot bread on the day it was taken away now one of sauls servants was there that day detained before the lord he was doeg the edomite sauls head shepherd david asked ahimelech dont you have a spear or a sword here i havent brought my sword or any other weapon because the kings business was urgent the priest replied the sword of goliath the philistine whom you killed in the valley of elah is here it is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod if you want it take it there is no sword here but that one david said there is none like it give it to me that day david fled from saul and went to achish king of gath but the servants of achish said to him isnt this david the king of the land isnt he the one they sing about in their dances saul has slain his thousands and david his tens of thousands david took these words to heart and was very much afraid of achish king of gath so he pretended to be insane in their presence and while he was in their hands he acted like a madman making marks on the doors of the gate and letting saliva run down his beard achish said to his servants look at the man he is insane why bring him to me am i so short of madmen that you have to bring this fellow here to carry on like this in front of me must this man come into my house david left gath and escaped to the cave of adullam when his brothers and his fathers household heard about it they went down to him there all those who were in distress or in debt or discontented gathered around him and he became their leader about four hundred men were with him from there david went to mizpah in moab and said to the king of moab would you let my father and mother come and stay with you until i learn what god will do for me so he left them with the king of moab and they stayed with him as long as david was in the stronghold but the prophet gad said to david do not stay in the stronghold go into the land of judah so david left and went to the forest of hereth now saul heard that david and his men had been discovered and saul spear in hand was seated under the tamarisk tree on the hill at gibeah with all his officials standing around him saul said to them listen men of benjamin will the son of jesse give all of you fields and vineyards will he make all of you commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds is that why you have all conspired against me no one tells me when my son makes a covenant with the son of jesse none of you is concerned about me or tells me that my son has incited my servant to lie in wait for me as he does today but doeg the edomite who was standing with sauls officials said i saw the son of jesse come to ahimelech son of ahitub at nob ahimelech inquired of the lord for him he also gave him provisions and the sword of goliath the philistine then the king sent for the priest ahimelech son of ahitub and his fathers whole family who were the priests at nob and they all came to the king saul said listen now son of ahitubyes my lord he answered saul said to him why have you conspired against me you and the son of jesse giving him bread and a sword and inquiring of god for him so that he has rebelled against me and lies in wait for me as he does today ahimelech answered the king who of all your servants is as loyal as david the kings son in law captain of your bodyguard and highly respected in your household was that day the first time i inquired of god for him of course not let not the king accuse your servant or any of his fathers family for your servant knows nothing at all about this whole affair but the king said you will surely die ahimelech you and your fathers whole family then the king ordered the guards at his side turn and kill the priests of the lord because they too have sided with david they knew he was fleeing yet they did not tell me but the kings officials were not willing to raise a hand to strike the priests of the lord the king then ordered doeg you turn and strike down the priests so doeg the edomite turned and struck them down that day he killed eighty five men who wore the linen ephod he also put to the sword nob the town of the priests with its men and women its children and infants and its cattle donkeys and sheep but abiathar a son of ahimelech son of ahitub escaped and fled to join david he told david that saul had killed the priests of the lord then david said to abiathar that day when doeg the edomite was there i knew he would be sure to tell saul i am responsible for the death of your fathers whole family stay with me dont be afraid the man who is seeking your life is seeking mine also you will be safe with me when david was told look the philistines are fighting against keilah and are looting the threshing floors he inquired of the lord saying shall i go and attack these philistines the lord answered him go attack the philistines and save keilah but davids men said to him here in judah we are afraid how much more then if we go to keilah against the philistine forces once again david inquired of the lord and the lord answered him go down to keilah for i am going to give the philistines into your hand so david and his men went to keilah fought the philistines and carried off their livestock he inflicted heavy losses on the philistines and saved the people of keilah now abiathar son of ahimelech had brought the ephod down with him when he fled to david at keilah saul was told that david had gone to keilah and he said god has handed him over to me for david has imprisoned himself by entering a town with gates and bars and saul called up all his forces for battle to go down to keilah to besiege david and his men when david learned that saul was plotting against him he said to abiathar the priest bring the ephod david said o lord god of israel your servant has heard definitely that saul plans to come to keilah and destroy the town on account of me will the citizens of keilah surrender me to him will saul come down as your servant has heard o lord god of israel tell your servant and the lord said he will again david asked will the citizens of keilah surrender me and my men to saul and the lord said they will so david and his men about six hundred in number left keilah and kept moving from place to place when saul was told that david had escaped from keilah he did not go there david stayed in the desert strongholds and in the hills of the desert of ziph day after day saul searched for him but god did not give david into his hands while david was at horesh in the desert of ziph he learned that saul had come out to take his life and sauls son jonathan went to david at horesh and helped him find strength in god dont be afraid he said my father saul will not lay a hand on you you will be king over israel and i will be second to you even my father saul knows this the two of them made a covenant before the lord then jonathan went home but david remained at horesh the ziphites went up to saul at gibeah and said is not david hiding among us in the strongholds at horesh on the hill of hakilah south of jeshimon now o king come down whenever it pleases you to do so and we will be responsible for handing him over to the king saul replied the lord bless you for your concern for me go and make further preparation find out where david usually goes and who has seen him there they tell me he is very crafty find out about all the hiding places he uses and come back to me with definite information then i will go with you if he is in the area i will track him down among all the clans of judah so they set out and went to ziph ahead of saul now david and his men were in the desert of maon in the arabah south of jeshimon saul and his men began the search and when david was told about it he went down to the rock and stayed in the desert of maon when saul heard this he went into the desert of maon in pursuit of david saul was going along one side of the mountain and david and his men were on the other side hurrying to get away from saul as saul and his forces were closing in on david and his men to capture them a messenger came to saul saying come quickly the philistines are raiding the land then saul broke off his pursuit of david and went to meet the philistines that is why they call this place sela hammahlekoth and david went up from there and lived in the strongholds of en gedi after saul returned from pursuing the philistines he was told david is in the desert of en gedi so saul took three thousand chosen men from all israel and set out to look for david and his men near the crags of the wild goats he came to the sheep pens along the way a cave was there and saul went in to relieve himself david and his men were far back in the cave the men said this is the day the lord spoke of when he said to you i will give your enemy into your hands for you to deal with as you wish then david crept up unnoticed and cut off a corner of sauls robe afterward david was conscience stricken for having cut off a corner of his robe he said to his men the lord forbid that i should do such a thing to my master the lords anointed or lift my hand against him for he is the anointed of the lord with these words david rebuked his men and did not allow them to attack saul and saul left the cave and went his way then david went out of the cave and called out to saul my lord the king when saul looked behind him david bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground he said to saul why do you listen when men say david is bent on harming you this day you have seen with your own eyes how the lord delivered you into my hands in the cave some urged me to kill you but i spared you i said i will not lift my hand against my master because he is the lords anointed see my father look at this piece of your robe in my hand i cut off the corner of your robe but did not kill you now understand and recognize that i am not guilty of wrongdoing or rebellion i have not wronged you but you are hunting me down to take my life may the lord judge between you and me and may the lord avenge the wrongs you have done to me but my hand will not touch you as the old saying goes from evildoers come evil deeds so my hand will not touch you against whom has the king of israel come out whom are you pursuing a dead dog a flea may the lord be our judge and decide between us may he consider my cause and uphold it may he vindicate me by delivering me from your hand when david finished saying this saul asked is that your voice david my son and he wept aloud you are more righteous than i he said you have treated me well but i have treated you badly you have just now told me of the good you did to me the lord delivered me into your hands but you did not kill me when a man finds his enemy does he let him get away unharmed may the lord reward you well for the way you treated me today i know that you will surely be king and that the kingdom of israel will be established in your hands now swear to me by the lord that you will not cut off my descendants or wipe out my name from my fathers family so david gave his oath to saul then saul returned home but david and his men went up to the stronghold now samuel died and all israel assembled and mourned for him and they buried him at his home in ramah then david moved down into the desert of maon a certain man in maon who had property there at carmel was very wealthy he had a thousand goats and three thousand sheep which he was shearing in carmel his name was nabal and his wifes name was abigail she was an intelligent and beautiful woman but her husband a calebite was surly and mean in his dealings while david was in the desert he heard that nabal was shearing sheep so he sent ten young men and said to them go up to nabal at carmel and greet him in my name say to him long life to you good health to you and your household and good health to all that is yours now i hear that it is sheep shearing time when your shepherds were with us we did not mistreat them and the whole time they were at carmel nothing of theirs was missing ask your own servants and they will tell you therefore be favorable toward my young men since we come at a festive time please give your servants and your son david whatever you can find for them when davids men arrived they gave nabal this message in davids name then they waited nabal answered davids servants who is this david who is this son of jesse many servants are breaking away from their masters these days why should i take my bread and water and the meat i have slaughtered for my shearers and give it to men coming from who knows where davids men turned around and went back when they arrived they reported every word david said to his men put on your swords so they put on their swords and david put on his about four hundred men went up with david while two hundred stayed with the supplies one of the servants told nabals wife abigail david sent messengers from the desert to give our master his greetings but he hurled insults at them yet these men were very good to us they did not mistreat us and the whole time we were out in the fields near them nothing was missing night and day they were a wall around us all the time we were herding our sheep near them now think it over and see what you can do because disaster is hanging over our master and his whole household he is such a wicked man that no one can talk to him abigail lost no time she took two hundred loaves of bread two skins of wine five dressed sheep five seahs of roasted grain a hundred cakes of raisins and two hundred cakes of pressed figs and loaded them on donkeys then she told her servants go on ahead ill follow you but she did not tell her husband nabal as she came riding her donkey into a mountain ravine there were david and his men descending toward her and she met them david had just said its been useless all my watching over this fellows property in the desert so that nothing of his was missing he has paid me back evil for good may god deal with david be it ever so severely if by morning i leave alive one male of all who belong to him when abigail saw david she quickly got off her donkey and bowed down before david with her face to the ground she fell at his feet and said my lord let the blame be on me alone please let your servant speak to you hear what your servant has to say may my lord pay no attention to that wicked man nabal he is just like his name his name is fool and folly goes with him but as for me your servant i did not see the men my master sent now since the lord has kept you my master from bloodshed and from avenging yourself with your own hands as surely as the lord lives and as you live may your enemies and all who intend to harm my master be like nabal and let this gift which your servant has brought to my master be given to the men who follow you please forgive your servants offense for the lord will certainly make a lasting dynasty for my master because he fights the lords battles let no wrongdoing be found in you as long as you live even though someone is pursuing you to take your life the life of my master will be bound securely in the bundle of the living by the lord your god but the lives of your enemies he will hurl away as from the pocket of a sling when the lord has done for my master every good thing he promised concerning him and has appointed him leader over israel my master will not have on his conscience the staggering burden of needless bloodshed or of having avenged himself and when the lord has brought my master success remember your servant david said to abigail praise be to the lord the god of israel who has sent you today to meet me may you be blessed for your good judgment and for keeping me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself with my own hands otherwise as surely as the lord the god of israel lives who has kept me from harming you if you had not come quickly to meet me not one male belonging to nabal would have been left alive by daybreak then david accepted from her hand what she had brought him and said go home in peace i have heard your words and granted your request when abigail went to nabal he was in the house holding a banquet like that of a king he was in high spirits and very drunk so she told him nothing until daybreak then in the morning when nabal was sober his wife told him all these things and his heart failed him and he became like a stone about ten days later the lord struck nabal and he died when david heard that nabal was dead he said praise be to the lord who has upheld my cause against nabal for treating me with contempt he has kept his servant from doing wrong and has brought nabals wrongdoing down on his own head then david sent word to abigail asking her to become his wife his servants went to carmel and said to abigail david has sent us to you to take you to become his wife she bowed down with her face to the ground and said here is your maidservant ready to serve you and wash the feet of my masters servants abigail quickly got on a donkey and attended by her five maids went with davids messengers and became his wife david had also married ahinoam of jezreel and they both were his wives but saul had given his daughter michal davids wife to paltiel son of laish who was from gallim the ziphites went to saul at gibeah and said is not david hiding on the hill of hakilah which faces jeshimon so saul went down to the desert of ziph with his three thousand chosen men of israel to search there for david saul made his camp beside the road on the hill of hakilah facing jeshimon but david stayed in the desert when he saw that saul had followed him there he sent out scouts and learned that saul had definitely arrived then david set out and went to the place where saul had camped he saw where saul and abner son of ner the commander of the army had lain down saul was lying inside the camp with the army encamped around him david then asked ahimelech the hittite and abishai son of zeruiah joabs brother who will go down into the camp with me to saulill go with you said abishai so david and abishai went to the army by night and there was saul lying asleep inside the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head abner and the soldiers were lying around him abishai said to david today god has delivered your enemy into your hands now let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of my spear i wont strike him twice but david said to abishai dont destroy him who can lay a hand on the lords anointed and be guiltless as surely as the lord lives he said the lord himself will strike him either his time will come and he will die or he will go into battle and perish but the lord forbid that i should lay a hand on the lords anointed now get the spear and water jug that are near his head and lets go so david took the spear and water jug near sauls head and they left no one saw or knew about it nor did anyone wake up they were all sleeping because the lord had put them into a deep sleep then david crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away there was a wide space between them he called out to the army and to abner son of ner arent you going to answer me abner abner replied who are you who calls to the king david said youre a man arent you and who is like you in israel why didnt you guard your lord the king someone came to destroy your lord the king what you have done is not good as surely as the lord lives you and your men deserve to die because you did not guard your master the lords anointed look around you where are the kings spear and water jug that were near his head saul recognized davids voice and said is that your voice david my son david replied yes it is my lord the king and he added why is my lord pursuing his servant what have i done and what wrong am i guilty of now let my lord the king listen to his servants words if the lord has incited you against me then may he accept an offering if however men have done it may they be cursed before the lord they have now driven me from my share in the lords inheritance and have said go serve other gods now do not let my blood fall to the ground far from the presence of the lord the king of israel has come out to look for a flea as one hunts a partridge in the mountains then saul said i have sinned come back david my son because you considered my life precious today i will not try to harm you again surely i have acted like a fool and have erred greatly here is the kings spear david answered let one of your young men come over and get it the lord rewards every man for his righteousness and faithfulness the lord delivered you into my hands today but i would not lay a hand on the lords anointed as surely as i valued your life today so may the lord value my life and deliver me from all trouble then saul said to david may you be blessed my son david you will do great things and surely triumph so david went on his way and saul returned home but david thought to himself one of these days i will be destroyed by the hand of saul the best thing i can do is to escape to the land of the philistines then saul will give up searching for me anywhere in israel and i will slip out of his hand so david and the six hundred men with him left and went over to achish son of maoch king of gath david and his men settled in gath with achish each man had his family with him and david had his two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail of carmel the widow of nabal when saul was told that david had fled to gath he no longer searched for him then david said to achish if i have found favor in your eyes let a place be assigned to me in one of the country towns that i may live there why should your servant live in the royal city with you so on that day achish gave him ziklag and it has belonged to the kings of judah ever since david lived in philistine territory a year and four months now david and his men went up and raided the geshurites the girzites and the amalekites from ancient times these peoples had lived in the land extending to shur and egypt whenever david attacked an area he did not leave a man or woman alive but took sheep and cattle donkeys and camels and clothes then he returned to achish when achish asked where did you go raiding today david would say against the negev of judah or against the negev of jerahmeel or against the negev of the kenites he did not leave a man or woman alive to be brought to gath for he thought they might inform on us and say this is what david did and such was his practice as long as he lived in philistine territory achish trusted david and said to himself he has become so odious to his people the israelites that he will be my servant forever in those days the philistines gathered their forces to fight against israel achish said to david you must understand that you and your men will accompany me in the army david said then you will see for yourself what your servant can do achish replied very well i will make you my bodyguard for life now samuel was dead and all israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of ramah saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land the philistines assembled and came and set up camp at shunem while saul gathered all the israelites and set up camp at gilboa when saul saw the philistine army he was afraid terror filled his heart he inquired of the lord but the lord did not answer him by dreams or urim or prophets saul then said to his attendants find me a woman who is a medium so i may go and inquire of herthere is one in endor they said so saul disguised himself putting on other clothes and at night he and two men went to the woman consult a spirit for me he said and bring up for me the one i name but the woman said to him surely you know what saul has done he has cut off the mediums and spiritists from the land why have you set a trap for my life to bring about my death saul swore to her by the lord as surely as the lord lives you will not be punished for this then the woman asked whom shall i bring up for youbring up samuel he said when the woman saw samuel she cried out at the top of her voice and said to saul why have you deceived me you are saul the king said to her dont be afraid what do you see the woman said i see a spirit coming up out of the ground what does he look like he asked an old man wearing a robe is coming up she said then saul knew it was samuel and he bowed down and prostrated himself with his face to the ground samuel said to saul why have you disturbed me by bringing me upi am in great distress saul said the philistines are fighting against me and god has turned away from me he no longer answers me either by prophets or by dreams so i have called on you to tell me what to do samuel said why do you consult me now that the lord has turned away from you and become your enemy the lord has done what he predicted through me the lord has torn the kingdom out of your hands and given it to one of your neighbors to david because you did not obey the lord or carry out his fierce wrath against the amalekites the lord has done this to you today the lord will hand over both israel and you to the philistines and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me the lord will also hand over the army of israel to the philistines immediately saul fell full length on the ground filled with fear because of samuels words his strength was gone for he had eaten nothing all that day and night when the woman came to saul and saw that he was greatly shaken she said look your maidservant has obeyed you i took my life in my hands and did what you told me to do now please listen to your servant and let me give you some food so you may eat and have the strength to go on your way he refused and said i will not eat but his men joined the woman in urging him and he listened to them he got up from the ground and sat on the couch the woman had a fattened calf at the house which she butchered at once she took some flour kneaded it and baked bread without yeast then she set it before saul and his men and they ate that same night they got up and left the philistines gathered all their forces at aphek and israel camped by the spring in jezreel as the philistine rulers marched with their units of hundreds and thousands david and his men were marching at the rear with achish the commanders of the philistines asked what about these hebrews achish replied is this not david who was an officer of saul king of israel he has already been with me for over a year and from the day he left saul until now i have found no fault in him but the philistine commanders were angry with him and said send the man back that he may return to the place you assigned him he must not go with us into battle or he will turn against us during the fighting how better could he regain his masters favor than by taking the heads of our own men isnt this the david they sang about in their dances saul has slain his thousands and david his tens of thousands so achish called david and said to him as surely as the lord lives you have been reliable and i would be pleased to have you serve with me in the army from the day you came to me until now i have found no fault in you but the rulers dont approve of you turn back and go in peace do nothing to displease the philistine rulers but what have i done asked david what have you found against your servant from the day i came to you until now why cant i go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king achish answered i know that you have been as pleasing in my eyes as an angel of god nevertheless the philistine commanders have said he must not go up with us into battle now get up early along with your masters servants who have come with you and leave in the morning as soon as it is light so david and his men got up early in the morning to go back to the land of the philistines and the philistines went up to jezreel david and his men reached ziklag on the third day now the amalekites had raided the negev and ziklag they had attacked ziklag and burned it and had taken captive the women and all who were in it both young and old they killed none of them but carried them off as they went on their way when david and his men came to ziklag they found it destroyed by fire and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive so david and his men wept aloud until they had no strength left to weep davids two wives had been captured ahinoam of jezreel and abigail the widow of nabal of carmel david was greatly distressed because the men were talking of stoning him each one was bitter in spirit because of his sons and daughters but david found strength in the lord his god then david said to abiathar the priest the son of ahimelech bring me the ephod abiathar brought it to him and david inquired of the lord shall i pursue this raiding party will i overtake thempursue them he answered you will certainly overtake them and succeed in the rescue david and the six hundred men with him came to the besor ravine where some stayed behind for two hundred men were too exhausted to cross the ravine but david and four hundred men continued the pursuit they found an egyptian in a field and brought him to david they gave him water to drink and food to eat part of a cake of pressed figs and two cakes of raisins he ate and was revived for he had not eaten any food or drunk any water for three days and three nights david asked him to whom do you belong and where do you come from he said i am an egyptian the slave of an amalekite my master abandoned me when i became ill three days ago we raided the negev of the kerethites and the territory belonging to judah and the negev of caleb and we burned ziklag david asked him can you lead me down to this raiding party he answered swear to me before god that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master and i will take you down to them he led david down and there they were scattered over the countryside eating drinking and reveling because of the great amount of plunder they had taken from the land of the philistines and from judah david fought them from dusk until the evening of the next day and none of them got away except four hundred young men who rode off on camels and fled david recovered everything the amalekites had taken including his two wives nothing was missing young or old boy or girl plunder or anything else they had taken david brought everything back he took all the flocks and herds and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock saying this is davids plunder then david came to the two hundred men who had been too exhausted to follow him and who were left behind at the besor ravine they came out to meet david and the people with him as david and his men approached he greeted them but all the evil men and troublemakers among davids followers said because they did not go out with us we will not share with them the plunder we recovered however each man may take his wife and children and go david replied no my brothers you must not do that with what the lord has given us he has protected us and handed over to us the forces that came against us who will listen to what you say the share of the man who stayed with the supplies is to be the same as that of him who went down to the battle all will share alike david made this a statute and ordinance for israel from that day to this when david arrived in ziklag he sent some of the plunder to the elders of judah who were his friends saying here is a present for you from the plunder of the lords enemies he sent it to those who were in bethel ramoth negev and jattir to those in aroer siphmoth eshtemoa and racal to those in the towns of the jerahmeelites and the kenites to those in hormah bor ashan athach and hebron and to those in all the other places where david and his men had roamed now the philistines fought against israel the israelites fled before them and many fell slain on mount gilboa the philistines pressed hard after saul and his sons and they killed his sons jonathan abinadab and malki shua the fighting grew fierce around saul and when the archers overtook him they wounded him critically saul said to his armor bearer draw your sword and run me through or these uncircumcised fellows will come and run me through and abuse me but his armor bearer was terrified and would not do it so saul took his own sword and fell on it when the armor bearer saw that saul was dead he too fell on his sword and died with him so saul and his three sons and his armor bearer and all his men died together that same day when the israelites along the valley and those across the jordan saw that the israelite army had fled and that saul and his sons had died they abandoned their towns and fled and the philistines came and occupied them the next day when the philistines came to strip the dead they found saul and his three sons fallen on mount gilboa they cut off his head and stripped off his armor and they sent messengers throughout the land of the philistines to proclaim the news in the temple of their idols and among their people they put his armor in the temple of the ashtoreths and fastened his body to the wall of beth shan when the people of jabesh gilead heard of what the philistines had done to saul all their valiant men journeyed through the night to beth shan they took down the bodies of saul and his sons from the wall of beth shan and went to jabesh where they burned them then they took their bones and buried them under a tamarisk tree at jabesh and they fasted seven days  after the death of saul david returned from defeating the amalekites and stayed in ziklag two days on the third day a man arrived from sauls camp with his clothes torn and with dust on his head when he came to david he fell to the ground to pay him honor where have you come from david asked him he answered i have escaped from the israelite camp what happened david asked tell me he said the men fled from the battle many of them fell and died and saul and his son jonathan are dead then david said to the young man who brought him the report how do you know that saul and his son jonathan are dead i happened to be on mount gilboa the young man said and there was saul leaning on his spear with the chariots and riders almost upon him when he turned around and saw me he called out to me and i said what can i do he asked me who are youan amalekite i answered then he said to me stand over me and kill me i am in the throes of death but im still alive so i stood over him and killed him because i knew that after he had fallen he could not survive and i took the crown that was on his head and the band on his arm and have brought them here to my lord then david and all the men with him took hold of their clothes and tore them they mourned and wept and fasted till evening for saul and his son jonathan and for the army of the lord and the house of israel because they had fallen by the sword david said to the young man who brought him the report where are you fromi am the son of an alien an amalekite he answered david asked him why were you not afraid to lift your hand to destroy the lords anointed then david called one of his men and said go strike him down so he struck him down and he died for david had said to him your blood be on your own head your own mouth testified against you when you said i killed the lords anointed david took up this lament concerning saul and his son jonathan and ordered that the men of judah be taught this lament of the bow it is written in the book of jashar your glory o israel lies slain on your heights how the mighty have fallen tell it not in gath proclaim it not in the streets of ashkelon lest the daughters of the philistines be glad lest the daughters of the uncircumcised rejoice o mountains of gilboa may you have neither dew nor rain nor fields that yield offerings of grain for there the shield of the mighty was defiled the shield of saul no longer rubbed with oil from the blood of the slain from the flesh of the mighty the bow of jonathan did not turn back the sword of saul did not return unsatisfied saul and jonathan in life they were loved and gracious and in death they were not parted they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions o daughters of israel weep for saul who clothed you in scarlet and finery who adorned your garments with ornaments of gold how the mighty have fallen in battle jonathan lies slain on your heights i grieve for you jonathan my brother you were very dear to me your love for me was wonderful more wonderful than that of women how the mighty have fallen the weapons of war have perished in the course of time david inquired of the lord shall i go up to one of the towns of judah he asked the lord said go up david asked where shall i goto hebron the lord answered so david went up there with his two wives ahinoam of jezreel and abigail the widow of nabal of carmel david also took the men who were with him each with his family and they settled in hebron and its towns then the men of judah came to hebron and there they anointed david king over the house of judah when david was told that it was the men of jabesh gilead who had buried saul he sent messengers to the men of jabesh gilead to say to them the lord bless you for showing this kindness to saul your master by burying him may the lord now show you kindness and faithfulness and i too will show you the same favor because you have done this now then be strong and brave for saul your master is dead and the house of judah has anointed me king over them meanwhile abner son of ner the commander of sauls army had taken ish bosheth son of saul and brought him over to mahanaim he made him king over gilead ashuri and jezreel and also over ephraim benjamin and all israel ish bosheth son of saul was forty years old when he became king over israel and he reigned two years the house of judah however followed david the length of time david was king in hebron over the house of judah was seven years and six months abner son of ner together with the men of ish bosheth son of saul left mahanaim and went to gibeon joab son of zeruiah and davids men went out and met them at the pool of gibeon one group sat down on one side of the pool and one group on the other side then abner said to joab lets have some of the young men get up and fight hand to hand in front of usall right let them do it joab said so they stood up and were counted off twelve men for benjamin and ish bosheth son of saul and twelve for david then each man grabbed his opponent by the head and thrust his dagger into his opponents side and they fell down together so that place in gibeon was called helkath hazzurim the battle that day was very fierce and abner and the men of israel were defeated by davids men the three sons of zeruiah were there joab abishai and asahel now asahel was as fleet footed as a wild gazelle he chased abner turning neither to the right nor to the left as he pursued him abner looked behind him and asked is that you asahelit is he answered then abner said to him turn aside to the right or to the left take on one of the young men and strip him of his weapons but asahel would not stop chasing him again abner warned asahel stop chasing me why should i strike you down how could i look your brother joab in the face but asahel refused to give up the pursuit so abner thrust the butt of his spear into asahels stomach and the spear came out through his back he fell there and died on the spot and every man stopped when he came to the place where asahel had fallen and died but joab and abishai pursued abner and as the sun was setting they came to the hill of ammah near giah on the way to the wasteland of gibeon then the men of benjamin rallied behind abner they formed themselves into a group and took their stand on top of a hill abner called out to joab must the sword devour forever dont you realize that this will end in bitterness how long before you order your men to stop pursuing their brothers joab answered as surely as god lives if you had not spoken the men would have continued the pursuit of their brothers until morning so joab blew the trumpet and all the men came to a halt they no longer pursued israel nor did they fight anymore all that night abner and his men marched through the arabah they crossed the jordan continued through the whole bithron and came to mahanaim then joab returned from pursuing abner and assembled all his men besides asahel nineteen of davids men were found missing but davids men had killed three hundred and sixty benjamites who were with abner they took asahel and buried him in his fathers tomb at bethlehem then joab and his men marched all night and arrived at hebron by daybreak the war between the house of saul and the house of david lasted a long time david grew stronger and stronger while the house of saul grew weaker and weaker sons were born to david in hebron his firstborn was amnon the son of ahinoam of jezreel his second kileab the son of abigail the widow of nabal of carmel the third absalom the son of maacah daughter of talmai king of geshur the fourth adonijah the son of haggith the fifth shephatiah the son of abital and the sixth ithream the son of davids wife eglah these were born to david in hebron during the war between the house of saul and the house of david abner had been strengthening his own position in the house of saul now saul had had a concubine named rizpah daughter of aiah and ish bosheth said to abner why did you sleep with my fathers concubine abner was very angry because of what ish bosheth said and he answered am i a dogs head on judahs side this very day i am loyal to the house of your father saul and to his family and friends i havent handed you over to david yet now you accuse me of an offense involving this woman may god deal with abner be it ever so severely if i do not do for david what the lord promised him on oath and transfer the kingdom from the house of saul and establish davids throne over israel and judah from dan to beersheba ish bosheth did not dare to say another word to abner because he was afraid of him then abner sent messengers on his behalf to say to david whose land is it make an agreement with me and i will help you bring all israel over to you good said david i will make an agreement with you but i demand one thing of you do not come into my presence unless you bring michal daughter of saul when you come to see me then david sent messengers to ish bosheth son of saul demanding give me my wife michal whom i betrothed to myself for the price of a hundred philistine foreskins so ish bosheth gave orders and had her taken away from her husband paltiel son of laish her husband however went with her weeping behind her all the way to bahurim then abner said to him go back home so he went back abner conferred with the elders of israel and said for some time you have wanted to make david your king now do it for the lord promised david by my servant david i will rescue my people israel from the hand of the philistines and from the hand of all their enemies abner also spoke to the benjamites in person then he went to hebron to tell david everything that israel and the whole house of benjamin wanted to do when abner who had twenty men with him came to david at hebron david prepared a feast for him and his men then abner said to david let me go at once and assemble all israel for my lord the king so that they may make a compact with you and that you may rule over all that your heart desires so david sent abner away and he went in peace just then davids men and joab returned from a raid and brought with them a great deal of plunder but abner was no longer with david in hebron because david had sent him away and he had gone in peace when joab and all the soldiers with him arrived he was told that abner son of ner had come to the king and that the king had sent him away and that he had gone in peace so joab went to the king and said what have you done look abner came to you why did you let him go now he is gone you know abner son of ner he came to deceive you and observe your movements and find out everything you are doing joab then left david and sent messengers after abner and they brought him back from the well of sirah but david did not know it now when abner returned to hebron joab took him aside into the gateway as though to speak with him privately and there to avenge the blood of his brother asahel joab stabbed him in the stomach and he died later when david heard about this he said i and my kingdom are forever innocent before the lord concerning the blood of abner son of ner may his blood fall upon the head of joab and upon all his fathers house may joabs house never be without someone who has a running sore or leprosy or who leans on a crutch or who falls by the sword or who lacks food joab and his brother abishai murdered abner because he had killed their brother asahel in the battle at gibeon then david said to joab and all the people with him tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and walk in mourning in front of abner king david himself walked behind the bier they buried abner in hebron and the king wept aloud at abners tomb all the people wept also the king sang this lament for abner should abner have died as the lawless die your hands were not bound your feet were not fettered you fell as one falls before wicked men and all the people wept over him again then they all came and urged david to eat something while it was still day but david took an oath saying may god deal with me be it ever so severely if i taste bread or anything else before the sun sets all the people took note and were pleased indeed everything the king did pleased them so on that day all the people and all israel knew that the king had no part in the murder of abner son of ner then the king said to his men do you not realize that a prince and a great man has fallen in israel this day and today though i am the anointed king i am weak and these sons of zeruiah are too strong for me may the lord repay the evildoer according to his evil deeds when ish bosheth son of saul heard that abner had died in hebron he lost courage and all israel became alarmed now sauls son had two men who were leaders of raiding bands one was named baanah and the other recab they were sons of rimmon the beerothite from the tribe of benjamin beeroth is considered part of benjamin because the people of beeroth fled to gittaim and have lived there as aliens to this day jonathan son of saul had a son who was lame in both feet he was five years old when the news about saul and jonathan came from jezreel his nurse picked him up and fled but as she hurried to leave he fell and became crippled his name was mephibosheth now recab and baanah the sons of rimmon the beerothite set out for the house of ish bosheth and they arrived there in the heat of the day while he was taking his noonday rest they went into the inner part of the house as if to get some wheat and they stabbed him in the stomach then recab and his brother baanah slipped away they had gone into the house while he was lying on the bed in his bedroom after they stabbed and killed him they cut off his head taking it with them they traveled all night by way of the arabah they brought the head of ish bosheth to david at hebron and said to the king here is the head of ish bosheth son of saul your enemy who tried to take your life this day the lord has avenged my lord the king against saul and his offspring david answered recab and his brother baanah the sons of rimmon the beerothite as surely as the lord lives who has delivered me out of all trouble when a man told me saul is dead and thought he was bringing good news i seized him and put him to death in ziklag that was the reward i gave him for his news how much more when wicked men have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed should i not now demand his blood from your hand and rid the earth of you so david gave an order to his men and they killed them they cut off their hands and feet and hung the bodies by the pool in hebron but they took the head of ish bosheth and buried it in abners tomb at hebron all the tribes of israel came to david at hebron and said we are your own flesh and blood in the past while saul was king over us you were the one who led israel on their military campaigns and the lord said to you you will shepherd my people israel and you will become their ruler when all the elders of israel had come to king david at hebron the king made a compact with them at hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel david was thirty years old when he became king and he reigned forty years in hebron he reigned over judah seven years and six months and in jerusalem he reigned over all israel and judah thirty three years the king and his men marched to jerusalem to attack the jebusites who lived there the jebusites said to david you will not get in here even the blind and the lame can ward you off they thought david cannot get in here nevertheless david captured the fortress of zion the city of david on that day david said anyone who conquers the jebusites will have to use the water shaft to reach those lame and blind who are davids enemies that is why they say the blind and lame will not enter the palace david then took up residence in the fortress and called it the city of david he built up the area around it from the supporting terraces inward and he became more and more powerful because the lord god almighty was with him now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david along with cedar logs and carpenters and stonemasons and they built a palace for david and david knew that the lord had established him as king over israel and had exalted his kingdom for the sake of his people israel after he left hebron david took more concubines and wives in jerusalem and more sons and daughters were born to him these are the names of the children born to him there shammua shobab nathan solomon ibhar elishua nepheg japhia elishama eliada and eliphelet when the philistines heard that david had been anointed king over israel they went up in full force to search for him but david heard about it and went down to the stronghold now the philistines had come and spread out in the valley of rephaim so david inquired of the lord shall i go and attack the philistines will you hand them over to me the lord answered him go for i will surely hand the philistines over to you so david went to baal perazim and there he defeated them he said as waters break out the lord has broken out against my enemies before me so that place was called baal perazim the philistines abandoned their idols there and david and his men carried them off once more the philistines came up and spread out in the valley of rephaim so david inquired of the lord and he answered do not go straight up but circle around behind them and attack them in front of the balsam trees as soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees move quickly because that will mean the lord has gone out in front of you to strike the philistine army so david did as the lord commanded him and he struck down the philistines all the way from gibeon to gezer david again brought together out of israel chosen men thirty thousand in all he and all his men set out from baalah of judah to bring up from there the ark of god which is called by the name the name of the lord almighty who is enthroned between the cherubim that are on the ark they set the ark of god on a new cart and brought it from the house of abinadab which was on the hill uzzah and ahio sons of abinadab were guiding the new cart with the ark of god on it and ahio was walking in front of it david and the whole house of israel were celebrating with all their might before the lord with songs and with harps lyres tambourines sistrums and cymbals when they came to the threshing floor of nacon uzzah reached out and took hold of the ark of god because the oxen stumbled the lords anger burned against uzzah because of his irreverent act therefore god struck him down and he died there beside the ark of god then david was angry because the lords wrath had broken out against uzzah and to this day that place is called perez uzzah david was afraid of the lord that day and said how can the ark of the lord ever come to me he was not willing to take the ark of the lord to be with him in the city of david instead he took it aside to the house of obed edom the gittite the ark of the lord remained in the house of obed edom the gittite for three months and the lord blessed him and his entire household now king david was told the lord has blessed the household of obed edom and everything he has because of the ark of god so david went down and brought up the ark of god from the house of obed edom to the city of david with rejoicing when those who were carrying the ark of the lord had taken six steps he sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf david wearing a linen ephod danced before the lord with all his might while he and the entire house of israel brought up the ark of the lord with shouts and the sound of trumpets as the ark of the lord was entering the city of david michal daughter of saul watched from a window and when she saw king david leaping and dancing before the lord she despised him in her heart they brought the ark of the lord and set it in its place inside the tent that david had pitched for it and david sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before the lord after he had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord almighty then he gave a loaf of bread a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each person in the whole crowd of israelites both men and women and all the people went to their homes when david returned home to bless his household michal daughter of saul came out to meet him and said how the king of israel has distinguished himself today disrobing in the sight of the slave girls of his servants as any vulgar fellow would david said to michal it was before the lord who chose me rather than your father or anyone from his house when he appointed me ruler over the lords people israel i will celebrate before the lord i will become even more undignified than this and i will be humiliated in my own eyes but by these slave girls you spoke of i will be held in honor and michal daughter of saul had no children to the day of her death after the king was settled in his palace and the lord had given him rest from all his enemies around him he said to nathan the prophet here i am living in a palace of cedar while the ark of god remains in a tent nathan replied to the king whatever you have in mind go ahead and do it for the lord is with you that night the word of the lord came to nathan saying go and tell my servant david this is what the lord says are you the one to build me a house to dwell in i have not dwelt in a house from the day i brought the israelites up out of egypt to this day i have been moving from place to place with a tent as my dwelling wherever i have moved with all the israelites did i ever say to any of their rulers whom i commanded to shepherd my people israel why have you not built me a house of cedar now then tell my servant david this is what the lord almighty says i took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people israel i have been with you wherever you have gone and i have cut off all your enemies from before you now i will make your name great like the names of the greatest men of the earth and i will provide a place for my people israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed wicked people will not oppress them anymore as they did at the beginning and have done ever since the time i appointed leaders over my people israel i will also give you rest from all your enemies the lord declares to you that the lord himself will establish a house for you when your days are over and you rest with your fathers i will raise up your offspring to succeed you who will come from your own body and i will establish his kingdom he is the one who will build a house for my name and i will establish the throne of his kingdom forever i will be his father and he will be my son when he does wrong i will punish him with the rod of men with floggings inflicted by men but my love will never be taken away from him as i took it away from saul whom i removed from before you your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me your throne will be established forever nathan reported to david all the words of this entire revelation then king david went in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o sovereign lord and what is my family that you have brought me this far and as if this were not enough in your sight o sovereign lord you have also spoken about the future of the house of your servant is this your usual way of dealing with man o sovereign lord what more can david say to you for you know your servant o sovereign lord for the sake of your word and according to your will you have done this great thing and made it known to your servant how great you are o sovereign lord there is no one like you and there is no god but you as we have heard with our own ears and who is like your people israel the one nation on earth that god went out to redeem as a people for himself and to make a name for himself and to perform great and awesome wonders by driving out nations and their gods from before your people whom you redeemed from egypt you have established your people israel as your very own forever and you o lord have become their god and now lord god keep forever the promise you have made concerning your servant and his house do as you promised so that your name will be great forever then men will say the lord almighty is god over israel and the house of your servant david will be established before you o lord almighty god of israel you have revealed this to your servant saying i will build a house for you so your servant has found courage to offer you this prayer o sovereign lord you are god your words are trustworthy and you have promised these good things to your servant now be pleased to bless the house of your servant that it may continue forever in your sight for you o sovereign lord have spoken and with your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever in the course of time david defeated the philistines and subdued them and he took metheg ammah from the control of the philistines david also defeated the moabites he made them lie down on the ground and measured them off with a length of cord every two lengths of them were put to death and the third length was allowed to live so the moabites became subject to david and brought tribute moreover david fought hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah when he went to restore his control along the euphrates river david captured a thousand of his chariots seven thousand charioteers and twenty thousand foot soldiers he hamstrung all but a hundred of the chariot horses when the arameans of damascus came to help hadadezer king of zobah david struck down twenty two thousand of them he put garrisons in the aramean kingdom of damascus and the arameans became subject to him and brought tribute the lord gave david victory wherever he went david took the gold shields that belonged to the officers of hadadezer and brought them to jerusalem from tebah and berothai towns that belonged to hadadezer king david took a great quantity of bronze when tou king of hamath heard that david had defeated the entire army of hadadezer he sent his son joram to king david to greet him and congratulate him on his victory in battle over hadadezer who had been at war with tou joram brought with him articles of silver and gold and bronze king david dedicated these articles to the lord as he had done with the silver and gold from all the nations he had subdued edom and moab the ammonites and the philistines and amalek he also dedicated the plunder taken from hadadezer son of rehob king of zobah and david became famous after he returned from striking down eighteen thousand edomites in the valley of salt he put garrisons throughout edom and all the edomites became subject to david the lord gave david victory wherever he went david reigned over all israel doing what was just and right for all his people joab son of zeruiah was over the army jehoshaphat son of ahilud was recorder zadok son of ahitub and ahimelech son of abiathar were priests seraiah was secretary benaiah son of jehoiada was over the kerethites and pelethites and davids sons were royal advisers david asked is there anyone still left of the house of saul to whom i can show kindness for jonathans sake now there was a servant of sauls household named ziba they called him to appear before david and the king said to him are you zibayour servant he replied the king asked is there no one still left of the house of saul to whom i can show gods kindness ziba answered the king there is still a son of jonathan he is crippled in both feet where is he the king asked ziba answered he is at the house of makir son of ammiel in lo debar so king david had him brought from lo debar from the house of makir son of ammiel when mephibosheth son of jonathan the son of saul came to david he bowed down to pay him honor david said mephiboshethyour servant he replied dont be afraid david said to him for i will surely show you kindness for the sake of your father jonathan i will restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather saul and you will always eat at my table mephibosheth bowed down and said what is your servant that you should notice a dead dog like me then the king summoned ziba sauls servant and said to him i have given your masters grandson everything that belonged to saul and his family you and your sons and your servants are to farm the land for him and bring in the crops so that your masters grandson may be provided for and mephibosheth grandson of your master will always eat at my table now ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants then ziba said to the king your servant will do whatever my lord the king commands his servant to do so mephibosheth ate at davids table like one of the kings sons mephibosheth had a young son named mica and all the members of zibas household were servants of mephibosheth and mephibosheth lived in jerusalem because he always ate at the kings table and he was crippled in both feet in the course of time the king of the ammonites died and his son hanun succeeded him as king david thought i will show kindness to hanun son of nahash just as his father showed kindness to me so david sent a delegation to express his sympathy to hanun concerning his father when davids men came to the land of the ammonites the ammonite nobles said to hanun their lord do you think david is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy hasnt david sent them to you to explore the city and spy it out and overthrow it so hanun seized davids men shaved off half of each mans beard cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks and sent them away when david was told about this he sent messengers to meet the men for they were greatly humiliated the king said stay at jericho till your beards have grown and then come back when the ammonites realized that they had become a stench in davids nostrils they hired twenty thousand aramean foot soldiers from beth rehob and zobah as well as the king of maacah with a thousand men and also twelve thousand men from tob on hearing this david sent joab out with the entire army of fighting men the ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city gate while the arameans of zobah and rehob and the men of tob and maacah were by themselves in the open country joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him so he selected some of the best troops in israel and deployed them against the arameans he put the rest of the men under the command of abishai his brother and deployed them against the ammonites joab said if the arameans are too strong for me then you are to come to my rescue but if the ammonites are too strong for you then i will come to rescue you be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our god the lord will do what is good in his sight then joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the arameans and they fled before him when the ammonites saw that the arameans were fleeing they fled before abishai and went inside the city so joab returned from fighting the ammonites and came to jerusalem after the arameans saw that they had been routed by israel they regrouped hadadezer had arameans brought from beyond the river they went to helam with shobach the commander of hadadezers army leading them when david was told of this he gathered all israel crossed the jordan and went to helam the arameans formed their battle lines to meet david and fought against him but they fled before israel and david killed seven hundred of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers he also struck down shobach the commander of their army and he died there when all the kings who were vassals of hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by israel they made peace with the israelites and became subject to them so the arameans were afraid to help the ammonites anymore in the spring at the time when kings go off to war david sent joab out with the kings men and the whole israelite army they destroyed the ammonites and besieged rabbah but david remained in jerusalem one evening david got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the palace from the roof he saw a woman bathing the woman was very beautiful and david sent someone to find out about her the man said isnt this bathsheba the daughter of eliam and the wife of uriah the hittite then david sent messengers to get her she came to him and he slept with her she had purified herself from her uncleanness then she went back home the woman conceived and sent word to david saying i am pregnant so david sent this word to joab send me uriah the hittite and joab sent him to david when uriah came to him david asked him how joab was how the soldiers were and how the war was going then david said to uriah go down to your house and wash your feet so uriah left the palace and a gift from the king was sent after him but uriah slept at the entrance to the palace with all his masters servants and did not go down to his house when david was told uriah did not go home he asked him havent you just come from a distance why didnt you go home uriah said to david the ark and israel and judah are staying in tents and my master joab and my lords men are camped in the open fields how could i go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife as surely as you live i will not do such a thing then david said to him stay here one more day and tomorrow i will send you back so uriah remained in jerusalem that day and the next at davids invitation he ate and drank with him and david made him drunk but in the evening uriah went out to sleep on his mat among his masters servants he did not go home in the morning david wrote a letter to joab and sent it with uriah in it he wrote put uriah in the front line where the fighting is fiercest then withdraw from him so he will be struck down and die so while joab had the city under siege he put uriah at a place where he knew the strongest defenders were when the men of the city came out and fought against joab some of the men in davids army fell moreover uriah the hittite died joab sent david a full account of the battle he instructed the messenger when you have finished giving the king this account of the battle the kings anger may flare up and he may ask you why did you get so close to the city to fight didnt you know they would shoot arrows from the wall who killed abimelech son of jerub besheth didnt a woman throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died in thebez why did you get so close to the wall if he asks you this then say to him also your servant uriah the hittite is dead the messenger set out and when he arrived he told david everything joab had sent him to say the messenger said to david the men overpowered us and came out against us in the open but we drove them back to the entrance to the city gate then the archers shot arrows at your servants from the wall and some of the kings men died moreover your servant uriah the hittite is dead david told the messenger say this to joab dont let this upset you the sword devours one as well as another press the attack against the city and destroy it say this to encourage joab when uriahs wife heard that her husband was dead she mourned for him after the time of mourning was over david had her brought to his house and she became his wife and bore him a son but the thing david had done displeased the lord the lord sent nathan to david when he came to him he said there were two men in a certain town one rich and the other poor the rich man had a very large number of sheep and cattle but the poor man had nothing except one little ewe lamb he had bought he raised it and it grew up with him and his children it shared his food drank from his cup and even slept in his arms it was like a daughter to him now a traveler came to the rich man but the rich man refrained from taking one of his own sheep or cattle to prepare a meal for the traveler who had come to him instead he took the ewe lamb that belonged to the poor man and prepared it for the one who had come to him david burned with anger against the man and said to nathan as surely as the lord lives the man who did this deserves to die he must pay for that lamb four times over because he did such a thing and had no pity then nathan said to david you are the man this is what the lord the god of israel says i anointed you king over israel and i delivered you from the hand of saul i gave your masters house to you and your masters wives into your arms i gave you the house of israel and judah and if all this had been too little i would have given you even more why did you despise the word of the lord by doing what is evil in his eyes you struck down uriah the hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own you killed him with the sword of the ammonites now therefore the sword will never depart from your house because you despised me and took the wife of uriah the hittite to be your own this is what the lord says out of your own household i am going to bring calamity upon you before your very eyes i will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight you did it in secret but i will do this thing in broad daylight before all israel then david said to nathan i have sinned against the lord nathan replied the lord has taken away your sin you are not going to die but because by doing this you have made the enemies of the lord show utter contempt the son born to you will die after nathan had gone home the lord struck the child that uriahs wife had borne to david and he became ill david pleaded with god for the child he fasted and went into his house and spent the nights lying on the ground the elders of his household stood beside him to get him up from the ground but he refused and he would not eat any food with them on the seventh day the child died davids servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead for they thought while the child was still living we spoke to david but he would not listen to us how can we tell him the child is dead he may do something desperate david noticed that his servants were whispering among themselves and he realized the child was dead is the child dead he asked yes they replied he is dead then david got up from the ground after he had washed put on lotions and changed his clothes he went into the house of the lord and worshiped then he went to his own house and at his request they served him food and he ate his servants asked him why are you acting this way while the child was alive you fasted and wept but now that the child is dead you get up and eat he answered while the child was still alive i fasted and wept i thought who knows the lord may be gracious to me and let the child live but now that he is dead why should i fast can i bring him back again i will go to him but he will not return to me then david comforted his wife bathsheba and he went to her and lay with her she gave birth to a son and they named him solomon the lord loved him and because the lord loved him he sent word through nathan the prophet to name him jedidiah meanwhile joab fought against rabbah of the ammonites and captured the royal citadel joab then sent messengers to david saying i have fought against rabbah and taken its water supply now muster the rest of the troops and besiege the city and capture it otherwise i will take the city and it will be named after me so david mustered the entire army and went to rabbah and attacked and captured it he took the crown from the head of their king its weight was a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones and it was placed on davids head he took a great quantity of plunder from the city and brought out the people who were there consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes and he made them work at brickmaking he did this to all the ammonite towns then david and his entire army returned to jerusalem in the course of time amnon son of david fell in love with tamar the beautiful sister of absalom son of david amnon became frustrated to the point of illness on account of his sister tamar for she was a virgin and it seemed impossible for him to do anything to her now amnon had a friend named jonadab son of shimeah davids brother jonadab was a very shrewd man he asked amnon why do you the kings son look so haggard morning after morning wont you tell me amnon said to him im in love with tamar my brother absaloms sister go to bed and pretend to be ill jonadab said when your father comes to see you say to him i would like my sister tamar to come and give me something to eat let her prepare the food in my sight so i may watch her and then eat it from her hand so amnon lay down and pretended to be ill when the king came to see him amnon said to him i would like my sister tamar to come and make some special bread in my sight so i may eat from her hand david sent word to tamar at the palace go to the house of your brother amnon and prepare some food for him so tamar went to the house of her brother amnon who was lying down she took some dough kneaded it made the bread in his sight and baked it then she took the pan and served him the bread but he refused to eat send everyone out of here amnon said so everyone left him then amnon said to tamar bring the food here into my bedroom so i may eat from your hand and tamar took the bread she had prepared and brought it to her brother amnon in his bedroom but when she took it to him to eat he grabbed her and said come to bed with me my sister dont my brother she said to him dont force me such a thing should not be done in israel dont do this wicked thing what about me where could i get rid of my disgrace and what about you you would be like one of the wicked fools in israel please speak to the king he will not keep me from being married to you but he refused to listen to her and since he was stronger than she he raped her then amnon hated her with intense hatred in fact he hated her more than he had loved her amnon said to her get up and get out no she said to him sending me away would be a greater wrong than what you have already done to me but he refused to listen to her he called his personal servant and said get this woman out of here and bolt the door after her so his servant put her out and bolted the door after her she was wearing a richly ornamented robe for this was the kind of garment the virgin daughters of the king wore tamar put ashes on her head and tore the ornamented robe she was wearing she put her hand on her head and went away weeping aloud as she went her brother absalom said to her has that amnon your brother been with you be quiet now my sister he is your brother dont take this thing to heart and tamar lived in her brother absaloms house a desolate woman when king david heard all this he was furious absalom never said a word to amnon either good or bad he hated amnon because he had disgraced his sister tamar two years later when absaloms sheepshearers were at baal hazor near the border of ephraim he invited all the kings sons to come there absalom went to the king and said your servant has had shearers come will the king and his officials please join me no my son the king replied all of us should not go we would only be a burden to you although absalom urged him he still refused to go but gave him his blessing then absalom said if not please let my brother amnon come with us the king asked him why should he go with you but absalom urged him so he sent with him amnon and the rest of the kings sons absalom ordered his men listen when amnon is in high spirits from drinking wine and i say to you strike amnon down then kill him dont be afraid have not i given you this order be strong and brave so absaloms men did to amnon what absalom had ordered then all the kings sons got up mounted their mules and fled while they were on their way the report came to david absalom has struck down all the kings sons not one of them is left the king stood up tore his clothes and lay down on the ground and all his servants stood by with their clothes torn but jonadab son of shimeah davids brother said my lord should not think that they killed all the princes only amnon is dead this has been absaloms expressed intention ever since the day amnon raped his sister tamar my lord the king should not be concerned about the report that all the kings sons are dead only amnon is dead meanwhile absalom had fled now the man standing watch looked up and saw many people on the road west of him coming down the side of the hill the watchman went and told the king i see men in the direction of horonaim on the side of the hill jonadab said to the king see the kings sons are here it has happened just as your servant said as he finished speaking the kings sons came in wailing loudly the king too and all his servants wept very bitterly absalom fled and went to talmai son of ammihud the king of geshur but king david mourned for his son every day after absalom fled and went to geshur he stayed there three years and the spirit of the king longed to go to absalom for he was consoled concerning amnons death joab son of zeruiah knew that the kings heart longed for absalom so joab sent someone to tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there he said to her pretend you are in mourning dress in mourning clothes and dont use any cosmetic lotions act like a woman who has spent many days grieving for the dead then go to the king and speak these words to him and joab put the words in her mouth when the woman from tekoa went to the king she fell with her face to the ground to pay him honor and she said help me o king the king asked her what is troubling you she said i am indeed a widow my husband is dead i your servant had two sons they got into a fight with each other in the field and no one was there to separate them one struck the other and killed him now the whole clan has risen up against your servant they say hand over the one who struck his brother down so that we may put him to death for the life of his brother whom he killed then we will get rid of the heir as well they would put out the only burning coal i have left leaving my husband neither name nor descendant on the face of the earth the king said to the woman go home and i will issue an order in your behalf but the woman from tekoa said to him my lord the king let the blame rest on me and on my fathers family and let the king and his throne be without guilt the king replied if anyone says anything to you bring him to me and he will not bother you again she said then let the king invoke the lord his god to prevent the avenger of blood from adding to the destruction so that my son will not be destroyedas surely as the lord lives he said not one hair of your sons head will fall to the ground then the woman said let your servant speak a word to my lord the kingspeak he replied the woman said why then have you devised a thing like this against the people of god when the king says this does he not convict himself for the king has not brought back his banished son like water spilled on the ground which cannot be recovered so we must die but god does not take away life instead he devises ways so that a banished person may not remain estranged from him and now i have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid your servant thought i will speak to the king perhaps he will do what his servant asks perhaps the king will agree to deliver his servant from the hand of the man who is trying to cut off both me and my son from the inheritance god gave us and now your servant says may the word of my lord the king bring me rest for my lord the king is like an angel of god in discerning good and evil may the lord your god be with you then the king said to the woman do not keep from me the answer to what i am going to ask youlet my lord the king speak the woman said the king asked isnt the hand of joab with you in all this the woman answered as surely as you live my lord the king no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything my lord the king says yes it was your servant joab who instructed me to do this and who put all these words into the mouth of your servant your servant joab did this to change the present situation my lord has wisdom like that of an angel of god he knows everything that happens in the land the king said to joab very well i will do it go bring back the young man absalom joab fell with his face to the ground to pay him honor and he blessed the king joab said today your servant knows that he has found favor in your eyes my lord the king because the king has granted his servants request then joab went to geshur and brought absalom back to jerusalem but the king said he must go to his own house he must not see my face so absalom went to his own house and did not see the face of the king in all israel there was not a man so highly praised for his handsome appearance as absalom from the top of his head to the sole of his foot there was no blemish in him whenever he cut the hair of his head he used to cut his hair from time to time when it became too heavy for him he would weigh it and its weight was two hundred shekels by the royal standard three sons and a daughter were born to absalom the daughters name was tamar and she became a beautiful woman absalom lived two years in jerusalem without seeing the kings face then absalom sent for joab in order to send him to the king but joab refused to come to him so he sent a second time but he refused to come then he said to his servants look joabs field is next to mine and he has barley there go and set it on fire so absaloms servants set the field on fire then joab did go to absaloms house and he said to him why have your servants set my field on fire absalom said to joab look i sent word to you and said come here so i can send you to the king to ask why have i come from geshur it would be better for me if i were still there now then i want to see the kings face and if i am guilty of anything let him put me to death so joab went to the king and told him this then the king summoned absalom and he came in and bowed down with his face to the ground before the king and the king kissed absalom in the course of time absalom provided himself with a chariot and horses and with fifty men to run ahead of him he would get up early and stand by the side of the road leading to the city gate whenever anyone came with a complaint to be placed before the king for a decision absalom would call out to him what town are you from he would answer your servant is from one of the tribes of israel then absalom would say to him look your claims are valid and proper but there is no representative of the king to hear you and absalom would add if only i were appointed judge in the land then everyone who has a complaint or case could come to me and i would see that he gets justice also whenever anyone approached him to bow down before him absalom would reach out his hand take hold of him and kiss him absalom behaved in this way toward all the israelites who came to the king asking for justice and so he stole the hearts of the men of israel at the end of four years absalom said to the king let me go to hebron and fulfill a vow i made to the lord while your servant was living at geshur in aram i made this vow if the lord takes me back to jerusalem i will worship the lord in hebron the king said to him go in peace so he went to hebron then absalom sent secret messengers throughout the tribes of israel to say as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets then say absalom is king in hebron two hundred men from jerusalem had accompanied absalom they had been invited as guests and went quite innocently knowing nothing about the matter while absalom was offering sacrifices he also sent for ahithophel the gilonite davids counselor to come from giloh his hometown and so the conspiracy gained strength and absaloms following kept on increasing a messenger came and told david the hearts of the men of israel are with absalom then david said to all his officials who were with him in jerusalem come we must flee or none of us will escape from absalom we must leave immediately or he will move quickly to overtake us and bring ruin upon us and put the city to the sword the kings officials answered him your servants are ready to do whatever our lord the king chooses the king set out with his entire household following him but he left ten concubines to take care of the palace so the king set out with all the people following him and they halted at a place some distance away all his men marched past him along with all the kerethites and pelethites and all the six hundred gittites who had accompanied him from gath marched before the king the king said to ittai the gittite why should you come along with us go back and stay with king absalom you are a foreigner an exile from your homeland you came only yesterday and today shall i make you wander about with us when i do not know where i am going go back and take your countrymen may kindness and faithfulness be with you but ittai replied to the king as surely as the lord lives and as my lord the king lives wherever my lord the king may be whether it means life or death there will your servant be david said to ittai go ahead march on so ittai the gittite marched on with all his men and the families that were with him the whole countryside wept aloud as all the people passed by the king also crossed the kidron valley and all the people moved on toward the desert zadok was there too and all the levites who were with him were carrying the ark of the covenant of god they set down the ark of god and abiathar offered sacrifices until all the people had finished leaving the city then the king said to zadok take the ark of god back into the city if i find favor in the lords eyes he will bring me back and let me see it and his dwelling place again but if he says i am not pleased with you then i am ready let him do to me whatever seems good to him the king also said to zadok the priest arent you a seer go back to the city in peace with your son ahimaaz and jonathan son of abiathar you and abiathar take your two sons with you i will wait at the fords in the desert until word comes from you to inform me so zadok and abiathar took the ark of god back to jerusalem and stayed there but david continued up the mount of olives weeping as he went his head was covered and he was barefoot all the people with him covered their heads too and were weeping as they went up now david had been told ahithophel is among the conspirators with absalom so david prayed o lord turn ahithophels counsel into foolishness when david arrived at the summit where people used to worship god hushai the arkite was there to meet him his robe torn and dust on his head david said to him if you go with me you will be a burden to me but if you return to the city and say to absalom i will be your servant o king i was your fathers servant in the past but now i will be your servant then you can help me by frustrating ahithophels advice wont the priests zadok and abiathar be there with you tell them anything you hear in the kings palace their two sons ahimaaz son of zadok and jonathan son of abiathar are there with them send them to me with anything you hear so davids friend hushai arrived at jerusalem as absalom was entering the city when david had gone a short distance beyond the summit there was ziba the steward of mephibosheth waiting to meet him he had a string of donkeys saddled and loaded with two hundred loaves of bread a hundred cakes of raisins a hundred cakes of figs and a skin of wine the king asked ziba why have you brought these ziba answered the donkeys are for the kings household to ride on the bread and fruit are for the men to eat and the wine is to refresh those who become exhausted in the desert the king then asked where is your masters grandson ziba said to him he is staying in jerusalem because he thinks today the house of israel will give me back my grandfathers kingdom then the king said to ziba all that belonged to mephibosheth is now yoursi humbly bow ziba said may i find favor in your eyes my lord the king as king david approached bahurim a man from the same clan as sauls family came out from there his name was shimei son of gera and he cursed as he came out he pelted david and all the kings officials with stones though all the troops and the special guard were on davids right and left as he cursed shimei said get out get out you man of blood you scoundrel the lord has repaid you for all the blood you shed in the household of saul in whose place you have reigned the lord has handed the kingdom over to your son absalom you have come to ruin because you are a man of blood then abishai son of zeruiah said to the king why should this dead dog curse my lord the king let me go over and cut off his head but the king said what do you and i have in common you sons of zeruiah if he is cursing because the lord said to him curse david who can ask why do you do this david then said to abishai and all his officials my son who is of my own flesh is trying to take my life how much more then this benjamite leave him alone let him curse for the lord has told him to it may be that the lord will see my distress and repay me with good for the cursing i am receiving today so david and his men continued along the road while shimei was going along the hillside opposite him cursing as he went and throwing stones at him and showering him with dirt the king and all the people with him arrived at their destination exhausted and there he refreshed himself meanwhile absalom and all the men of israel came to jerusalem and ahithophel was with him then hushai the arkite davids friend went to absalom and said to him long live the king long live the king absalom asked hushai is this the love you show your friend why didnt you go with your friend hushai said to absalom no the one chosen by the lord by these people and by all the men of israel his i will be and i will remain with him furthermore whom should i serve should i not serve the son just as i served your father so i will serve you absalom said to ahithophel give us your advice what should we do ahithophel answered lie with your fathers concubines whom he left to take care of the palace then all israel will hear that you have made yourself a stench in your fathers nostrils and the hands of everyone with you will be strengthened so they pitched a tent for absalom on the roof and he lay with his fathers concubines in the sight of all israel now in those days the advice ahithophel gave was like that of one who inquires of god that was how both david and absalom regarded all of ahithophels advice ahithophel said to absalom i would choose twelve thousand men and set out tonight in pursuit of david i would attack him while he is weary and weak i would strike him with terror and then all the people with him will flee i would strike down only the king and bring all the people back to you the death of the man you seek will mean the return of all all the people will be unharmed this plan seemed good to absalom and to all the elders of israel but absalom said summon also hushai the arkite so we can hear what he has to say when hushai came to him absalom said ahithophel has given this advice should we do what he says if not give us your opinion hushai replied to absalom the advice ahithophel has given is not good this time you know your father and his men they are fighters and as fierce as a wild bear robbed of her cubs besides your father is an experienced fighter he will not spend the night with the troops even now he is hidden in a cave or some other place if he should attack your troops first whoever hears about it will say there has been a slaughter among the troops who follow absalom then even the bravest soldier whose heart is like the heart of a lion will melt with fear for all israel knows that your father is a fighter and that those with him are brave so i advise you let all israel from dan to beersheba as numerous as the sand on the seashore be gathered to you with you yourself leading them into battle then we will attack him wherever he may be found and we will fall on him as dew settles on the ground neither he nor any of his men will be left alive if he withdraws into a city then all israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it down to the valley until not even a piece of it can be found absalom and all the men of israel said the advice of hushai the arkite is better than that of ahithophel for the lord had determined to frustrate the good advice of ahithophel in order to bring disaster on absalom hushai told zadok and abiathar the priests ahithophel has advised absalom and the elders of israel to do such and such but i have advised them to do so and so now send a message immediately and tell david do not spend the night at the fords in the desert cross over without fail or the king and all the people with him will be swallowed up jonathan and ahimaaz were staying at en rogel a servant girl was to go and inform them and they were to go and tell king david for they could not risk being seen entering the city but a young man saw them and told absalom so the two of them left quickly and went to the house of a man in bahurim he had a well in his courtyard and they climbed down into it his wife took a covering and spread it out over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it no one knew anything about it when absaloms men came to the woman at the house they asked where are ahimaaz and jonathan the woman answered them they crossed over the brook the men searched but found no one so they returned to jerusalem after the men had gone the two climbed out of the well and went to inform king david they said to him set out and cross the river at once ahithophel has advised such and such against you so david and all the people with him set out and crossed the jordan by daybreak no one was left who had not crossed the jordan when ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed he saddled his donkey and set out for his house in his hometown he put his house in order and then hanged himself so he died and was buried in his fathers tomb david went to mahanaim and absalom crossed the jordan with all the men of israel absalom had appointed amasa over the army in place of joab amasa was the son of a man named jether an israelite who had married abigail the daughter of nahash and sister of zeruiah the mother of joab the israelites and absalom camped in the land of gilead when david came to mahanaim shobi son of nahash from rabbah of the ammonites and makir son of ammiel from lo debar and barzillai the gileadite from rogelim brought bedding and bowls and articles of pottery they also brought wheat and barley flour and roasted grain beans and lentils honey and curds sheep and cheese from cows milk for david and his people to eat for they said the people have become hungry and tired and thirsty in the desert david mustered the men who were with him and appointed over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds david sent the troops out a third under the command of joab a third under joabs brother abishai son of zeruiah and a third under ittai the gittite the king told the troops i myself will surely march out with you but the men said you must not go out if we are forced to flee they wont care about us even if half of us die they wont care but you are worth ten thousand of us it would be better now for you to give us support from the city the king answered i will do whatever seems best to you so the king stood beside the gate while all the men marched out in units of hundreds and of thousands the king commanded joab abishai and ittai be gentle with the young man absalom for my sake and all the troops heard the king giving orders concerning absalom to each of the commanders the army marched into the field to fight israel and the battle took place in the forest of ephraim there the army of israel was defeated by davids men and the casualties that day were great twenty thousand men the battle spread out over the whole countryside and the forest claimed more lives that day than the sword now absalom happened to meet davids men he was riding his mule and as the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak absaloms head got caught in the tree he was left hanging in midair while the mule he was riding kept on going when one of the men saw this he told joab i just saw absalom hanging in an oak tree joab said to the man who had told him this what you saw him why didnt you strike him to the ground right there then i would have had to give you ten shekels of silver and a warriors belt but the man replied even if a thousand shekels were weighed out into my hands i would not lift my hand against the kings son in our hearing the king commanded you and abishai and ittai protect the young man absalom for my sake and if i had put my life in jeopardy and nothing is hidden from the king you would have kept your distance from me joab said im not going to wait like this for you so he took three javelins in his hand and plunged them into absaloms heart while absalom was still alive in the oak tree and ten of joabs armor bearers surrounded absalom struck him and killed him then joab sounded the trumpet and the troops stopped pursuing israel for joab halted them they took absalom threw him into a big pit in the forest and piled up a large heap of rocks over him meanwhile all the israelites fled to their homes during his lifetime absalom had taken a pillar and erected it in the kings valley as a monument to himself for he thought i have no son to carry on the memory of my name he named the pillar after himself and it is called absaloms monument to this day now ahimaaz son of zadok said let me run and take the news to the king that the lord has delivered him from the hand of his enemies you are not the one to take the news today joab told him you may take the news another time but you must not do so today because the kings son is dead then joab said to a cushite go tell the king what you have seen the cushite bowed down before joab and ran off ahimaaz son of zadok again said to joab come what may please let me run behind the cushite but joab replied my son why do you want to go you dont have any news that will bring you a reward he said come what may i want to run so joab said run then ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and outran the cushite while david was sitting between the inner and outer gates the watchman went up to the roof of the gateway by the wall as he looked out he saw a man running alone the watchman called out to the king and reported it the king said if he is alone he must have good news and the man came closer and closer then the watchman saw another man running and he called down to the gatekeeper look another man running alone the king said he must be bringing good news too the watchman said it seems to me that the first one runs like ahimaaz son of zadokhes a good man the king said he comes with good news then ahimaaz called out to the king all is well he bowed down before the king with his face to the ground and said praise be to the lord your god he has delivered up the men who lifted their hands against my lord the king the king asked is the young man absalom safe ahimaaz answered i saw great confusion just as joab was about to send the kings servant and me your servant but i dont know what it was the king said stand aside and wait here so he stepped aside and stood there then the cushite arrived and said my lord the king hear the good news the lord has delivered you today from all who rose up against you the king asked the cushite is the young man absalom safe the cushite replied may the enemies of my lord the king and all who rise up to harm you be like that young man the king was shaken he went up to the room over the gateway and wept as he went he said o my son absalom my son my son absalom if only i had died instead of you o absalom my son my son joab was told the king is weeping and mourning for absalom and for the whole army the victory that day was turned into mourning because on that day the troops heard it said the king is grieving for his son the men stole into the city that day as men steal in who are ashamed when they flee from battle the king covered his face and cried aloud o my son absalom o absalom my son my son then joab went into the house to the king and said today you have humiliated all your men who have just saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and the lives of your wives and concubines you love those who hate you and hate those who love you you have made it clear today that the commanders and their men mean nothing to you i see that you would be pleased if absalom were alive today and all of us were dead now go out and encourage your men i swear by the lord that if you dont go out not a man will be left with you by nightfall this will be worse for you than all the calamities that have come upon you from your youth till now so the king got up and took his seat in the gateway when the men were told the king is sitting in the gateway they all came before him meanwhile the israelites had fled to their homes throughout the tribes of israel the people were all arguing with each other saying the king delivered us from the hand of our enemies he is the one who rescued us from the hand of the philistines but now he has fled the country because of absalom and absalom whom we anointed to rule over us has died in battle so why do you say nothing about bringing the king back king david sent this message to zadok and abiathar the priests ask the elders of judah why should you be the last to bring the king back to his palace since what is being said throughout israel has reached the king at his quarters you are my brothers my own flesh and blood so why should you be the last to bring back the king and say to amasa are you not my own flesh and blood may god deal with me be it ever so severely if from now on you are not the commander of my army in place of joab he won over the hearts of all the men of judah as though they were one man they sent word to the king return you and all your men then the king returned and went as far as the jordan now the men of judah had come to gilgal to go out and meet the king and bring him across the jordan shimei son of gera the benjamite from bahurim hurried down with the men of judah to meet king david with him were a thousand benjamites along with ziba the steward of sauls household and his fifteen sons and twenty servants they rushed to the jordan where the king was they crossed at the ford to take the kings household over and to do whatever he wished when shimei son of gera crossed the jordan he fell prostrate before the king and said to him may my lord not hold me guilty do not remember how your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left jerusalem may the king put it out of his mind for i your servant know that i have sinned but today i have come here as the first of the whole house of joseph to come down and meet my lord the king then abishai son of zeruiah said shouldnt shimei be put to death for this he cursed the lords anointed david replied what do you and i have in common you sons of zeruiah this day you have become my adversaries should anyone be put to death in israel today do i not know that today i am king over israel so the king said to shimei you shall not die and the king promised him on oath mephibosheth sauls grandson also went down to meet the king he had not taken care of his feet or trimmed his mustache or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely when he came from jerusalem to meet the king the king asked him why didnt you go with me mephibosheth he said my lord the king since i your servant am lame i said i will have my donkey saddled and will ride on it so i can go with the king but ziba my servant betrayed me and he has slandered your servant to my lord the king my lord the king is like an angel of god so do whatever pleases you all my grandfathers descendants deserved nothing but death from my lord the king but you gave your servant a place among those who eat at your table so what right do i have to make any more appeals to the king the king said to him why say more i order you and ziba to divide the fields mephibosheth said to the king let him take everything now that my lord the king has arrived home safely barzillai the gileadite also came down from rogelim to cross the jordan with the king and to send him on his way from there now barzillai was a very old man eighty years of age he had provided for the king during his stay in mahanaim for he was a very wealthy man the king said to barzillai cross over with me and stay with me in jerusalem and i will provide for you but barzillai answered the king how many more years will i live that i should go up to jerusalem with the king i am now eighty years old can i tell the difference between what is good and what is not can your servant taste what he eats and drinks can i still hear the voices of men and women singers why should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king your servant will cross over the jordan with the king for a short distance but why should the king reward me in this way let your servant return that i may die in my own town near the tomb of my father and mother but here is your servant kimham let him cross over with my lord the king do for him whatever pleases you the king said kimham shall cross over with me and i will do for him whatever pleases you and anything you desire from me i will do for you so all the people crossed the jordan and then the king crossed over the king kissed barzillai and gave him his blessing and barzillai returned to his home when the king crossed over to gilgal kimham crossed with him all the troops of judah and half the troops of israel had taken the king over soon all the men of israel were coming to the king and saying to him why did our brothers the men of judah steal the king away and bring him and his household across the jordan together with all his men all the men of judah answered the men of israel we did this because the king is closely related to us why are you angry about it have we eaten any of the kings provisions have we taken anything for ourselves then the men of israel answered the men of judah we have ten shares in the king and besides we have a greater claim on david than you have so why do you treat us with contempt were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king but the men of judah responded even more harshly than the men of israel now a troublemaker named sheba son of bicri a benjamite happened to be there he sounded the trumpet and shouted we have no share in david no part in jesses son every man to his tent o israel so all the men of israel deserted david to follow sheba son of bicri but the men of judah stayed by their king all the way from the jordan to jerusalem when david returned to his palace in jerusalem he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace and put them in a house under guard he provided for them but did not lie with them they were kept in confinement till the day of their death living as widows then the king said to amasa summon the men of judah to come to me within three days and be here yourself but when amasa went to summon judah he took longer than the time the king had set for him david said to abishai now sheba son of bicri will do us more harm than absalom did take your masters men and pursue him or he will find fortified cities and escape from us so joabs men and the kerethites and pelethites and all the mighty warriors went out under the command of abishai they marched out from jerusalem to pursue sheba son of bicri while they were at the great rock in gibeon amasa came to meet them joab was wearing his military tunic and strapped over it at his waist was a belt with a dagger in its sheath as he stepped forward it dropped out of its sheath joab said to amasa how are you my brother then joab took amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him amasa was not on his guard against the dagger in joabs hand and joab plunged it into his belly and his intestines spilled out on the ground without being stabbed again amasa died then joab and his brother abishai pursued sheba son of bicri one of joabs men stood beside amasa and said whoever favors joab and whoever is for david let him follow joab amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the road and the man saw that all the troops came to a halt there when he realized that everyone who came up to amasa stopped he dragged him from the road into a field and threw a garment over him after amasa had been removed from the road all the men went on with joab to pursue sheba son of bicri sheba passed through all the tribes of israel to abel beth maacah and through the entire region of the berites who gathered together and followed him all the troops with joab came and besieged sheba in abel beth maacah they built a siege ramp up to the city and it stood against the outer fortifications while they were battering the wall to bring it down a wise woman called from the city listen listen tell joab to come here so i can speak to him he went toward her and she asked are you joabi am he answered she said listen to what your servant has to sayim listening he said she continued long ago they used to say get your answer at abel and that settled it we are the peaceful and faithful in israel you are trying to destroy a city that is a mother in israel why do you want to swallow up the lords inheritance far be it from me joab replied far be it from me to swallow up or destroy that is not the case a man named sheba son of bicri from the hill country of ephraim has lifted up his hand against the king against david hand over this one man and ill withdraw from the city the woman said to joab his head will be thrown to you from the wall then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice and they cut off the head of sheba son of bicri and threw it to joab so he sounded the trumpet and his men dispersed from the city each returning to his home and joab went back to the king in jerusalem joab was over israels entire army benaiah son of jehoiada was over the kerethites and pelethites adoniram was in charge of forced labor jehoshaphat son of ahilud was recorder sheva was secretary zadok and abiathar were priests and ira the jairite was davids priest during the reign of david there was a famine for three successive years so david sought the face of the lord the lord said it is on account of saul and his blood stained house it is because he put the gibeonites to death the king summoned the gibeonites and spoke to them now the gibeonites were not a part of israel but were survivors of the amorites the israelites had sworn to spare them but saul in his zeal for israel and judah had tried to annihilate them david asked the gibeonites what shall i do for you how shall i make amends so that you will bless the lords inheritance the gibeonites answered him we have no right to demand silver or gold from saul or his family nor do we have the right to put anyone in israel to deathwhat do you want me to do for you david asked they answered the king as for the man who destroyed us and plotted against us so that we have been decimated and have no place anywhere in israel let seven of his male descendants be given to us to be killed and exposed before the lord at gibeah of saul the lord s chosen one so the king said i will give them to you the king spared mephibosheth son of jonathan the son of saul because of the oath before the lord between david and jonathan son of saul but the king took armoni and mephibosheth the two sons of aiahs daughter rizpah whom she had borne to saul together with the five sons of sauls daughter merab whom she had borne to adriel son of barzillai the meholathite he handed them over to the gibeonites who killed and exposed them on a hill before the lord all seven of them fell together they were put to death during the first days of the harvest just as the barley harvest was beginning rizpah daughter of aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on a rock from the beginning of the harvest till the rain poured down from the heavens on the bodies she did not let the birds of the air touch them by day or the wild animals by night when david was told what aiahs daughter rizpah sauls concubine had done he went and took the bones of saul and his son jonathan from the citizens of jabesh gilead they had taken them secretly from the public square at beth shan where the philistines had hung them after they struck saul down on gilboa david brought the bones of saul and his son jonathan from there and the bones of those who had been killed and exposed were gathered up they buried the bones of saul and his son jonathan in the tomb of sauls father kish at zela in benjamin and did everything the king commanded after that god answered prayer in behalf of the land once again there was a battle between the philistines and israel david went down with his men to fight against the philistines and he became exhausted and ishbi benob one of the descendants of rapha whose bronze spearhead weighed three hundred shekels and who was armed with a new sword said he would kill david but abishai son of zeruiah came to davids rescue he struck the philistine down and killed him then davids men swore to him saying never again will you go out with us to battle so that the lamp of israel will not be extinguished in the course of time there was another battle with the philistines at gob at that time sibbecai the hushathite killed saph one of the descendants of rapha in another battle with the philistines at gob elhanan son of jaare oregim the bethlehemite killed goliath the gittite who had a spear with a shaft like a weavers rod in still another battle which took place at gath there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot twenty four in all he also was descended from rapha when he taunted israel jonathan son of shimeah davids brother killed him these four were descendants of rapha in gath and they fell at the hands of david and his men david sang to the lord the words of this song when the lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of saul he said the lord is my rock my fortress and my deliverer my god is my rock in whom i take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation he is my stronghold my refuge and my savior from violent men you save me i call to the lord who is worthy of praise and i am saved from my enemies the waves of death swirled about me the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me the cords of the grave coiled around me the snares of death confronted me in my distress i called to the lord i called out to my god from his temple he heard my voice my cry came to his ears the earth trembled and quaked the foundations of the heavens shook they trembled because he was angry smoke rose from his nostrils consuming fire came from his mouth burning coals blazed out of it he parted the heavens and came down dark clouds were under his feet he mounted the cherubim and flew he soared on the wings of the wind he made darkness his canopy around him the dark rain clouds of the sky out of the brightness of his presence bolts of lightning blazed forth the lord thundered from heaven the voice of the most high resounded he shot arrows and scattered the enemies bolts of lightning and routed them the valleys of the sea were exposed and the foundations of the earth laid bare at the rebuke of the lord at the blast of breath from his nostrils he reached down from on high and took hold of me he drew me out of deep waters he rescued me from my powerful enemy from my foes who were too strong for me they confronted me in the day of my disaster but the lord was my support he brought me out into a spacious place he rescued me because he delighted in me the lord has dealt with me according to my righteousness according to the cleanness of my hands he has rewarded me for i have kept the ways of the lord i have not done evil by turning from my god all his laws are before me i have not turned away from his decrees i have been blameless before him and have kept myself from sin the lord has rewarded me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his sight to the faithful you show yourself faithful to the blameless you show yourself blameless to the pure you show yourself pure but to the crooked you show yourself shrewd you save the humble but your eyes are on the haughty to bring them low you are my lamp o lord the lord turns my darkness into light with your help i can advance against a troop with my god i can scale a wall as for god his way is perfect the word of the lord is flawless he is a shield for all who take refuge in him for who is god besides the lord and who is the rock except our god it is god who arms me with strength and makes my way perfect he makes my feet like the feet of a deer he enables me to stand on the heights he trains my hands for battle my arms can bend a bow of bronze you give me your shield of victory you stoop down to make me great you broaden the path beneath me so that my ankles do not turn i pursued my enemies and crushed them i did not turn back till they were destroyed i crushed them completely and they could not rise they fell beneath my feet you armed me with strength for battle you made my adversaries bow at my feet you made my enemies turn their backs in flight and i destroyed my foes they cried for help but there was no one to save them to the lord but he did not answer i beat them as fine as the dust of the earth i pounded and trampled them like mud in the streets you have delivered me from the attacks of my people you have preserved me as the head of nations people i did not know are subject to me and foreigners come cringing to me as soon as they hear me they obey me they all lose heart they come trembling from their strongholds the lord lives praise be to my rock exalted be god the rock my savior he is the god who avenges me who puts the nations under me who sets me free from my enemies you exalted me above my foes from violent men you rescued me therefore i will praise you o lord among the nations i will sing praises to your name he gives his king great victories he shows unfailing kindness to his anointed to david and his descendants forever these are the last words of david the oracle of david son of jesse the oracle of the man exalted by the most high the man anointed by the god of jacob israels singer of songs the spirit of the lord spoke through me his word was on my tongue the god of israel spoke the rock of israel said to me when one rules over men in righteousness when he rules in the fear of god he is like the light of morning at sunrise on a cloudless morning like the brightness after rain that brings the grass from the earth is not my house right with god has he not made with me an everlasting covenant arranged and secured in every part will he not bring to fruition my salvation and grant me my every desire but evil men are all to be cast aside like thorns which are not gathered with the hand whoever touches thorns uses a tool of iron or the shaft of a spear they are burned up where they lie these are the names of davids mighty men josheb basshebeth a tahkemonite was chief of the three he raised his spear against eight hundred men whom he killed in one encounter next to him was eleazar son of dodai the ahohite as one of the three mighty men he was with david when they taunted the philistines gathered at pas dammim for battle then the men of israel retreated but he stood his ground and struck down the philistines till his hand grew tired and froze to the sword the lord brought about a great victory that day the troops returned to eleazar but only to strip the dead next to him was shammah son of agee the hararite when the philistines banded together at a place where there was a field full of lentils israels troops fled from them but shammah took his stand in the middle of the field he defended it and struck the philistines down and the lord brought about a great victory during harvest time three of the thirty chief men came down to david at the cave of adullam while a band of philistines was encamped in the valley of rephaim at that time david was in the stronghold and the philistine garrison was at bethlehem david longed for water and said oh that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of bethlehem so the three mighty men broke through the philistine lines drew water from the well near the gate of bethlehem and carried it back to david but he refused to drink it instead he poured it out before the lord far be it from me o lord to do this he said is it not the blood of men who went at the risk of their lives and david would not drink it such were the exploits of the three mighty men abishai the brother of joab son of zeruiah was chief of the three he raised his spear against three hundred men whom he killed and so he became as famous as the three was he not held in greater honor than the three he became their commander even though he was not included among them benaiah son of jehoiada was a valiant fighter from kabzeel who performed great exploits he struck down two of moabs best men he also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion and he struck down a huge egyptian although the egyptian had a spear in his hand benaiah went against him with a club he snatched the spear from the egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear such were the exploits of benaiah son of jehoiada he too was as famous as the three mighty men he was held in greater honor than any of the thirty but he was not included among the three and david put him in charge of his bodyguard among the thirty were asahel the brother of joab elhanan son of dodo from bethlehem shammah the harodite elika the harodite helez the paltite ira son of ikkesh from tekoa abiezer from anathoth mebunnai the hushathite zalmon the ahohite maharai the netophathite heled son of baanah the netophathite ithai son of ribai from gibeah in benjamin benaiah the pirathonite hiddai from the ravines of gaash abi albon the arbathite azmaveth the barhumite eliahba the shaalbonite the sons of jashen jonathan son of shammah the hararite ahiam son of sharar the hararite eliphelet son of ahasbai the maacathite eliam son of ahithophel the gilonite hezro the carmelite paarai the arbite igal son of nathan from zobah the son of hagri zelek the ammonite naharai the beerothite the armor bearer of joab son of zeruiah ira the ithrite gareb the ithrite and uriah the hittite there were thirty seven in all again the anger of the lord burned against israel and he incited david against them saying go and take a census of israel and judah so the king said to joab and the army commanders with him go throughout the tribes of israel from dan to beersheba and enroll the fighting men so that i may know how many there are but joab replied to the king may the lord your god multiply the troops a hundred times over and may the eyes of my lord the king see it but why does my lord the king want to do such a thing the kings word however overruled joab and the army commanders so they left the presence of the king to enroll the fighting men of israel after crossing the jordan they camped near aroer south of the town in the gorge and then went through gad and on to jazer they went to gilead and the region of tahtim hodshi and on to dan jaan and around toward sidon then they went toward the fortress of tyre and all the towns of the hivites and canaanites finally they went on to beersheba in the negev of judah after they had gone through the entire land they came back to jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days joab reported the number of the fighting men to the king in israel there were eight hundred thousand able bodied men who could handle a sword and in judah five hundred thousand david was conscience stricken after he had counted the fighting men and he said to the lord i have sinned greatly in what i have done now o lord i beg you take away the guilt of your servant i have done a very foolish thing before david got up the next morning the word of the lord had come to gad the prophet davids seer go and tell david this is what the lord says i am giving you three options choose one of them for me to carry out against you so gad went to david and said to him shall there come upon you three years of famine in your land or three months of fleeing from your enemies while they pursue you or three days of plague in your land now then think it over and decide how i should answer the one who sent me david said to gad i am in deep distress let us fall into the hands of the lord for his mercy is great but do not let me fall into the hands of men so the lord sent a plague on israel from that morning until the end of the time designated and seventy thousand of the people from dan to beersheba died when the angel stretched out his hand to destroy jerusalem the lord was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was afflicting the people enough withdraw your hand the angel of the lord was then at the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite when david saw the angel who was striking down the people he said to the lord i am the one who has sinned and done wrong these are but sheep what have they done let your hand fall upon me and my family on that day gad went to david and said to him go up and build an altar to the lord on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite so david went up as the lord had commanded through gad when araunah looked and saw the king and his men coming toward him he went out and bowed down before the king with his face to the ground araunah said why has my lord the king come to his servantto buy your threshing floor david answered so i can build an altar to the lord that the plague on the people may be stopped araunah said to david let my lord the king take whatever pleases him and offer it up here are oxen for the burnt offering and here are threshing sledges and ox yokes for the wood o king araunah gives all this to the king araunah also said to him may the lord your god accept you but the king replied to araunah no i insist on paying you for it i will not sacrifice to the lord my god burnt offerings that cost me nothing so david bought the threshing floor and the oxen and paid fifty shekels of silver for them david built an altar to the lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings then the lord answered prayer in behalf of the land and the plague on israel was stopped  when king david was old and well advanced in years he could not keep warm even when they put covers over him so his servants said to him let us look for a young virgin to attend the king and take care of him she can lie beside him so that our lord the king may keep warm then they searched throughout israel for a beautiful girl and found abishag a shunammite and brought her to the king the girl was very beautiful she took care of the king and waited on him but the king had no intimate relations with her now adonijah whose mother was haggith put himself forward and said i will be king so he got chariots and horses ready with fifty men to run ahead of him his father had never interfered with him by asking why do you behave as you do he was also very handsome and was born next after absalom adonijah conferred with joab son of zeruiah and with abiathar the priest and they gave him their support but zadok the priest benaiah son of jehoiada nathan the prophet shimei and rei and davids special guard did not join adonijah adonijah then sacrificed sheep cattle and fattened calves at the stone of zoheleth near en rogel he invited all his brothers the kings sons and all the men of judah who were royal officials but he did not invite nathan the prophet or benaiah or the special guard or his brother solomon then nathan asked bathsheba solomons mother have you not heard that adonijah the son of haggith has become king without our lord davids knowing it now then let me advise you how you can save your own life and the life of your son solomon go in to king david and say to him my lord the king did you not swear to me your servant surely solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne why then has adonijah become king while you are still there talking to the king i will come in and confirm what you have said so bathsheba went to see the aged king in his room where abishag the shunammite was attending him bathsheba bowed low and knelt before the king what is it you want the king asked she said to him my lord you yourself swore to me your servant by the lord your god solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne but now adonijah has become king and you my lord the king do not know about it he has sacrificed great numbers of cattle fattened calves and sheep and has invited all the kings sons abiathar the priest and joab the commander of the army but he has not invited solomon your servant my lord the king the eyes of all israel are on you to learn from you who will sit on the throne of my lord the king after him otherwise as soon as my lord the king is laid to rest with his fathers i and my son solomon will be treated as criminals while she was still speaking with the king nathan the prophet arrived and they told the king nathan the prophet is here so he went before the king and bowed with his face to the ground nathan said have you my lord the king declared that adonijah shall be king after you and that he will sit on your throne today he has gone down and sacrificed great numbers of cattle fattened calves and sheep he has invited all the kings sons the commanders of the army and abiathar the priest right now they are eating and drinking with him and saying long live king adonijah but me your servant and zadok the priest and benaiah son of jehoiada and your servant solomon he did not invite is this something my lord the king has done without letting his servants know who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him then king david said call in bathsheba so she came into the kings presence and stood before him the king then took an oath as surely as the lord lives who has delivered me out of every trouble i will surely carry out today what i swore to you by the lord the god of israel solomon your son shall be king after me and he will sit on my throne in my place then bathsheba bowed low with her face to the ground and kneeling before the king said may my lord king david live forever king david said call in zadok the priest nathan the prophet and benaiah son of jehoiada when they came before the king he said to them take your lords servants with you and set solomon my son on my own mule and take him down to gihon there have zadok the priest and nathan the prophet anoint him king over israel blow the trumpet and shout long live king solomon then you are to go up with him and he is to come and sit on my throne and reign in my place i have appointed him ruler over israel and judah benaiah son of jehoiada answered the king amen may the lord the god of my lord the king so declare it as the lord was with my lord the king so may he be with solomon to make his throne even greater than the throne of my lord king david so zadok the priest nathan the prophet benaiah son of jehoiada the kerethites and the pelethites went down and put solomon on king davids mule and escorted him to gihon zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed solomon then they sounded the trumpet and all the people shouted long live king solomon and all the people went up after him playing flutes and rejoicing greatly so that the ground shook with the sound adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they were finishing their feast on hearing the sound of the trumpet joab asked whats the meaning of all the noise in the city even as he was speaking jonathan son of abiathar the priest arrived adonijah said come in a worthy man like you must be bringing good news not at all jonathan answered our lord king david has made solomon king the king has sent with him zadok the priest nathan the prophet benaiah son of jehoiada the kerethites and the pelethites and they have put him on the kings mule and zadok the priest and nathan the prophet have anointed him king at gihon from there they have gone up cheering and the city resounds with it thats the noise you hear moreover solomon has taken his seat on the royal throne also the royal officials have come to congratulate our lord king david saying may your god make solomons name more famous than yours and his throne greater than yours and the king bowed in worship on his bed and said praise be to the lord the god of israel who has allowed my eyes to see a successor on my throne today at this all adonijahs guests rose in alarm and dispersed but adonijah in fear of solomon went and took hold of the horns of the altar then solomon was told adonijah is afraid of king solomon and is clinging to the horns of the altar he says let king solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword solomon replied if he shows himself to be a worthy man not a hair of his head will fall to the ground but if evil is found in him he will die then king solomon sent men and they brought him down from the altar and adonijah came and bowed down to king solomon and solomon said go to your home when the time drew near for david to die he gave a charge to solomon his son i am about to go the way of all the earth he said so be strong show yourself a man and observe what the lord your god requires walk in his ways and keep his decrees and commands his laws and requirements as written in the law of moses so that you may prosper in all you do and wherever you go and that the lord may keep his promise to me if your descendants watch how they live and if they walk faithfully before me with all their heart and soul you will never fail to have a man on the throne of israel now you yourself know what joab son of zeruiah did to me what he did to the two commanders of israels armies abner son of ner and amasa son of jether he killed them shedding their blood in peacetime as if in battle and with that blood stained the belt around his waist and the sandals on his feet deal with him according to your wisdom but do not let his gray head go down to the grave in peace but show kindness to the sons of barzillai of gilead and let them be among those who eat at your table they stood by me when i fled from your brother absalom and remember you have with you shimei son of gera the benjamite from bahurim who called down bitter curses on me the day i went to mahanaim when he came down to meet me at the jordan i swore to him by the lord i will not put you to death by the sword but now do not consider him innocent you are a man of wisdom you will know what to do to him bring his gray head down to the grave in blood then david rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david he had reigned forty years over israel seven years in hebron and thirty three in jerusalem so solomon sat on the throne of his father david and his rule was firmly established now adonijah the son of haggith went to bathsheba solomons mother bathsheba asked him do you come peacefully he answered yes peacefully then he added i have something to say to youyou may say it she replied as you know he said the kingdom was mine all israel looked to me as their king but things changed and the kingdom has gone to my brother for it has come to him from the lord now i have one request to make of you do not refuse meyou may make it she said so he continued please ask king solomon he will not refuse you to give me abishag the shunammite as my wife very well bathsheba replied i will speak to the king for you when bathsheba went to king solomon to speak to him for adonijah the king stood up to meet her bowed down to her and sat down on his throne he had a throne brought for the kings mother and she sat down at his right hand i have one small request to make of you she said do not refuse me the king replied make it my mother i will not refuse you so she said let abishag the shunammite be given in marriage to your brother adonijah king solomon answered his mother why do you request abishag the shunammite for adonijah you might as well request the kingdom for him after all he is my older brother yes for him and for abiathar the priest and joab son of zeruiah then king solomon swore by the lord may god deal with me be it ever so severely if adonijah does not pay with his life for this request and now as surely as the lord lives he who has established me securely on the throne of my father david and has founded a dynasty for me as he promised adonijah shall be put to death today so king solomon gave orders to benaiah son of jehoiada and he struck down adonijah and he died to abiathar the priest the king said go back to your fields in anathoth you deserve to die but i will not put you to death now because you carried the ark of the sovereign lord before my father david and shared all my fathers hardships so solomon removed abiathar from the priesthood of the lord fulfilling the word the lord had spoken at shiloh about the house of eli when the news reached joab who had conspired with adonijah though not with absalom he fled to the tent of the lord and took hold of the horns of the altar king solomon was told that joab had fled to the tent of the lord and was beside the altar then solomon ordered benaiah son of jehoiada go strike him down so benaiah entered the tent of the lord and said to joab the king says come out but he answered no i will die here benaiah reported to the king this is how joab answered me then the king commanded benaiah do as he says strike him down and bury him and so clear me and my fathers house of the guilt of the innocent blood that joab shed the lord will repay him for the blood he shed because without the knowledge of my father david he attacked two men and killed them with the sword both of them abner son of ner commander of israels army and amasa son of jether commander of judahs army were better men and more upright than he may the guilt of their blood rest on the head of joab and his descendants forever but on david and his descendants his house and his throne may there be the lords peace forever so benaiah son of jehoiada went up and struck down joab and killed him and he was buried on his own land in the desert the king put benaiah son of jehoiada over the army in joabs position and replaced abiathar with zadok the priest then the king sent for shimei and said to him build yourself a house in jerusalem and live there but do not go anywhere else the day you leave and cross the kidron valley you can be sure you will die your blood will be on your own head shimei answered the king what you say is good your servant will do as my lord the king has said and shimei stayed in jerusalem for a long time but three years later two of shimeis slaves ran off to achish son of maacah king of gath and shimei was told your slaves are in gath at this he saddled his donkey and went to achish at gath in search of his slaves so shimei went away and brought the slaves back from gath when solomon was told that shimei had gone from jerusalem to gath and had returned the king summoned shimei and said to him did i not make you swear by the lord and warn you on the day you leave to go anywhere else you can be sure you will die at that time you said to me what you say is good i will obey why then did you not keep your oath to the lord and obey the command i gave you the king also said to shimei you know in your heart all the wrong you did to my father david now the lord will repay you for your wrongdoing but king solomon will be blessed and davids throne will remain secure before the lord forever then the king gave the order to benaiah son of jehoiada and he went out and struck shimei down and killed him the kingdom was now firmly established in solomons hands solomon made an alliance with pharaoh king of egypt and married his daughter he brought her to the city of david until he finished building his palace and the temple of the lord and the wall around jerusalem the people however were still sacrificing at the high places because a temple had not yet been built for the name of the lord solomon showed his love for the lord by walking according to the statutes of his father david except that he offered sacrifices and burned incense on the high places the king went to gibeon to offer sacrifices for that was the most important high place and solomon offered a thousand burnt offerings on that altar at gibeon the lord appeared to solomon during the night in a dream and god said ask for whatever you want me to give you solomon answered you have shown great kindness to your servant my father david because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart you have continued this great kindness to him and have given him a son to sit on his throne this very day now o lord my god you have made your servant king in place of my father david but i am only a little child and do not know how to carry out my duties your servant is here among the people you have chosen a great people too numerous to count or number so give your servant a discerning heart to govern your people and to distinguish between right and wrong for who is able to govern this great people of yours the lord was pleased that solomon had asked for this so god said to him since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice i will do what you have asked i will give you a wise and discerning heart so that there will never have been anyone like you nor will there ever be moreover i will give you what you have not asked for both riches and honor so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings and if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commands as david your father did i will give you a long life then solomon awoke and he realized it had been a dream he returned to jerusalem stood before the ark of the lords covenant and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings then he gave a feast for all his court now two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him one of them said my lord this woman and i live in the same house i had a baby while she was there with me the third day after my child was born this woman also had a baby we were alone there was no one in the house but the two of us during the night this womans son died because she lay on him so she got up in the middle of the night and took my son from my side while i your servant was asleep she put him by her breast and put her dead son by my breast the next morning i got up to nurse my son and he was dead but when i looked at him closely in the morning light i saw that it wasnt the son i had borne the other woman said no the living one is my son the dead one is yours but the first one insisted no the dead one is yours the living one is mine and so they argued before the king the king said this one says my son is alive and your son is dead while that one says no your son is dead and mine is alive then the king said bring me a sword so they brought a sword for the king he then gave an order cut the living child in two and give half to one and half to the other the woman whose son was alive was filled with compassion for her son and said to the king please my lord give her the living baby dont kill him but the other said neither i nor you shall have him cut him in two then the king gave his ruling give the living baby to the first woman do not kill him she is his mother when all israel heard the verdict the king had given they held the king in awe because they saw that he had wisdom from god to administer justice so king solomon ruled over all israel and these were his chief officials azariah son of zadok the priest elihoreph and ahijah sons of shisha secretaries jehoshaphat son of ahilud recorder benaiah son of jehoiada commander in chief zadok and abiathar priests azariah son of nathan in charge of the district officers zabud son of nathan a priest and personal adviser to the king ahishar in charge of the palace adoniram son of abda in charge of forced labor solomon also had twelve district governors over all israel who supplied provisions for the king and the royal household each one had to provide supplies for one month in the year these are their names ben hur in the hill country of ephraim ben deker in makaz shaalbim beth shemesh and elon bethhanan ben hesed in arubboth socoh and all the land of hepher were his ben abinadab in naphoth dor he was married to taphath daughter of solomon baana son of ahilud in taanach and megiddo and in all of beth shan next to zarethan below jezreel from beth shan to abel meholah across to jokmeam ben geber in ramoth gilead the settlements of jair son of manasseh in gilead were his as well as the district of argob in bashan and its sixty large walled cities with bronze gate bars ahinadab son of iddo in mahanaim ahimaaz in naphtali he had married basemath daughter of solomon baana son of hushai in asher and in aloth jehoshaphat son of paruah in issachar shimei son of ela in benjamin geber son of uri in gilead the country of sihon king of the amorites and the country of og king of bashan he was the only governor over the district the people of judah and israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore they ate they drank and they were happy and solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the river to the land of the philistines as far as the border of egypt these countries brought tribute and were solomons subjects all his life solomons daily provisions were thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal ten head of stall fed cattle twenty of pasture fed cattle and a hundred sheep and goats as well as deer gazelles roebucks and choice fowl for he ruled over all the kingdoms west of the river from tiphsah to gaza and had peace on all sides during solomons lifetime judah and israel from dan to beersheba lived in safety each man under his own vine and fig tree solomon had four thousand stalls for chariot horses and twelve thousand horses the district officers each in his month supplied provisions for king solomon and all who came to the kings table they saw to it that nothing was lacking they also brought to the proper place their quotas of barley and straw for the chariot horses and the other horses god gave solomon wisdom and very great insight and a breadth of understanding as measureless as the sand on the seashore solomons wisdom was greater than the wisdom of all the men of the east and greater than all the wisdom of egypt he was wiser than any other man including ethan the ezrahite wiser than heman calcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame spread to all the surrounding nations he spoke three thousand proverbs and his songs numbered a thousand and five he described plant life from the cedar of lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of walls he also taught about animals and birds reptiles and fish men of all nations came to listen to solomons wisdom sent by all the kings of the world who had heard of his wisdom when hiram king of tyre heard that solomon had been anointed king to succeed his father david he sent his envoys to solomon because he had always been on friendly terms with david solomon sent back this message to hiram you know that because of the wars waged against my father david from all sides he could not build a temple for the name of the lord his god until the lord put his enemies under his feet but now the lord my god has given me rest on every side and there is no adversary or disaster i intend therefore to build a temple for the name of the lord my god as the lord told my father david when he said your son whom i will put on the throne in your place will build the temple for my name so give orders that cedars of lebanon be cut for me my men will work with yours and i will pay you for your men whatever wages you set you know that we have no one so skilled in felling timber as the sidonians when hiram heard solomons message he was greatly pleased and said praise be to the lord today for he has given david a wise son to rule over this great nation so hiram sent word to solomon i have received the message you sent me and will do all you want in providing the cedar and pine logs my men will haul them down from lebanon to the sea and i will float them in rafts by sea to the place you specify there i will separate them and you can take them away and you are to grant my wish by providing food for my royal household in this way hiram kept solomon supplied with all the cedar and pine logs he wanted and solomon gave hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household in addition to twenty thousand baths of pressed olive oil solomon continued to do this for hiram year after year the lord gave solomon wisdom just as he had promised him there were peaceful relations between hiram and solomon and the two of them made a treaty king solomon conscripted laborers from all israel thirty thousand men he sent them off to lebanon in shifts of ten thousand a month so that they spent one month in lebanon and two months at home adoniram was in charge of the forced labor solomon had seventy thousand carriers and eighty thousand stonecutters in the hills as well as thirty three hundred foremen who supervised the project and directed the workmen at the kings command they removed from the quarry large blocks of quality stone to provide a foundation of dressed stone for the temple the craftsmen of solomon and hiram and the men of gebal cut and prepared the timber and stone for the building of the temple in the four hundred and eightieth year after the israelites had come out of egypt in the fourth year of solomons reign over israel in the month of ziv the second month he began to build the temple of the lord the temple that king solomon built for the lord was sixty cubits long twenty wide and thirty high the portico at the front of the main hall of the temple extended the width of the temple that is twenty cubits and projected ten cubits from the front of the temple he made narrow clerestory windows in the temple against the walls of the main hall and inner sanctuary he built a structure around the building in which there were side rooms the lowest floor was five cubits wide the middle floor six cubits and the third floor seven he made offset ledges around the outside of the temple so that nothing would be inserted into the temple walls in building the temple only blocks dressed at the quarry were used and no hammer chisel or any other iron tool was heard at the temple site while it was being built the entrance to the lowest floor was on the south side of the temple a stairway led up to the middle level and from there to the third so he built the temple and completed it roofing it with beams and cedar planks and he built the side rooms all along the temple the height of each was five cubits and they were attached to the temple by beams of cedar the word of the lord came to solomon as for this temple you are building if you follow my decrees carry out my regulations and keep all my commands and obey them i will fulfill through you the promise i gave to david your father and i will live among the israelites and will not abandon my people israel so solomon built the temple and completed it he lined its interior walls with cedar boards paneling them from the floor of the temple to the ceiling and covered the floor of the temple with planks of pine he partitioned off twenty cubits at the rear of the temple with cedar boards from floor to ceiling to form within the temple an inner sanctuary the most holy place the main hall in front of this room was forty cubits long the inside of the temple was cedar carved with gourds and open flowers everything was cedar no stone was to be seen he prepared the inner sanctuary within the temple to set the ark of the covenant of the lord there the inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long twenty wide and twenty high he overlaid the inside with pure gold and he also overlaid the altar of cedar solomon covered the inside of the temple with pure gold and he extended gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary which was overlaid with gold so he overlaid the whole interior with gold he also overlaid with gold the altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary in the inner sanctuary he made a pair of cherubim of olive wood each ten cubits high one wing of the first cherub was five cubits long and the other wing five cubits ten cubits from wing tip to wing tip the second cherub also measured ten cubits for the two cherubim were identical in size and shape the height of each cherub was ten cubits he placed the cherubim inside the innermost room of the temple with their wings spread out the wing of one cherub touched one wall while the wing of the other touched the other wall and their wings touched each other in the middle of the room he overlaid the cherubim with gold on the walls all around the temple in both the inner and outer rooms he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers he also covered the floors of both the inner and outer rooms of the temple with gold for the entrance of the inner sanctuary he made doors of olive wood with five sided jambs and on the two olive wood doors he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers and overlaid the cherubim and palm trees with beaten gold in the same way he made four sided jambs of olive wood for the entrance to the main hall he also made two pine doors each having two leaves that turned in sockets he carved cherubim palm trees and open flowers on them and overlaid them with gold hammered evenly over the carvings and he built the inner courtyard of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams the foundation of the temple of the lord was laid in the fourth year in the month of ziv in the eleventh year in the month of bul the eighth month the temple was finished in all its details according to its specifications he had spent seven years building it it took solomon thirteen years however to complete the construction of his palace he built the palace of the forest of lebanon a hundred cubits long fifty wide and thirty high with four rows of cedar columns supporting trimmed cedar beams it was roofed with cedar above the beams that rested on the columns forty five beams fifteen to a row its windows were placed high in sets of three facing each other all the doorways had rectangular frames they were in the front part in sets of three facing each other he made a colonnade fifty cubits long and thirty wide in front of it was a portico and in front of that were pillars and an overhanging roof he built the throne hall the hall of justice where he was to judge and he covered it with cedar from floor to ceiling and the palace in which he was to live set farther back was similar in design solomon also made a palace like this hall for pharaohs daughter whom he had married all these structures from the outside to the great courtyard and from foundation to eaves were made of blocks of high grade stone cut to size and trimmed with a saw on their inner and outer faces the foundations were laid with large stones of good quality some measuring ten cubits and some eight above were high grade stones cut to size and cedar beams the great courtyard was surrounded by a wall of three courses of dressed stone and one course of trimmed cedar beams as was the inner courtyard of the temple of the lord with its portico king solomon sent to tyre and brought huram whose mother was a widow from the tribe of naphtali and whose father was a man of tyre and a craftsman in bronze huram was highly skilled and experienced in all kinds of bronze work he came to king solomon and did all the work assigned to him he cast two bronze pillars each eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits around by line he also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars each capital was five cubits high a network of interwoven chains festooned the capitals on top of the pillars seven for each capital he made pomegranates in two rows encircling each network to decorate the capitals on top of the pillars he did the same for each capital the capitals on top of the pillars in the portico were in the shape of lilies four cubits high on the capitals of both pillars above the bowl shaped part next to the network were the two hundred pomegranates in rows all around he erected the pillars at the portico of the temple the pillar to the south he named jakin and the one to the north boaz the capitals on top were in the shape of lilies and so the work on the pillars was completed he made the sea of cast metal circular in shape measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high it took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it below the rim gourds encircled it ten to a cubit the gourds were cast in two rows in one piece with the sea the sea stood on twelve bulls three facing north three facing west three facing south and three facing east the sea rested on top of them and their hindquarters were toward the center it was a handbreadth in thickness and its rim was like the rim of a cup like a lily blossom it held two thousand baths he also made ten movable stands of bronze each was four cubits long four wide and three high this is how the stands were made they had side panels attached to uprights on the panels between the uprights were lions bulls and cherubim and on the uprights as well above and below the lions and bulls were wreaths of hammered work each stand had four bronze wheels with bronze axles and each had a basin resting on four supports cast with wreaths on each side on the inside of the stand there was an opening that had a circular frame one cubit deep this opening was round and with its basework it measured a cubit and a half around its opening there was engraving the panels of the stands were square not round the four wheels were under the panels and the axles of the wheels were attached to the stand the diameter of each wheel was a cubit and a half the wheels were made like chariot wheels the axles rims spokes and hubs were all of cast metal each stand had four handles one on each corner projecting from the stand at the top of the stand there was a circular band half a cubit deep the supports and panels were attached to the top of the stand he engraved cherubim lions and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and on the panels in every available space with wreaths all around this is the way he made the ten stands they were all cast in the same molds and were identical in size and shape he then made ten bronze basins each holding forty baths and measuring four cubits across one basin to go on each of the ten stands he placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five on the north he placed the sea on the south side at the southeast corner of the temple he also made the basins and shovels and sprinkling bowls so huram finished all the work he had undertaken for king solomon in the temple of the lord the two pillars the two bowl shaped capitals on top of the pillars the two sets of network decorating the two bowl shaped capitals on top of the pillars the four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of network two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl shaped capitals on top of the pillars the ten stands with their ten basins the sea and the twelve bulls under it the pots shovels and sprinkling bowls all these objects that huram made for king solomon for the temple of the lord were of burnished bronze the king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the jordan between succoth and zarethan solomon left all these things unweighed because there were so many the weight of the bronze was not determined solomon also made all the furnishings that were in the lords temple the golden altar the golden table on which was the bread of the presence the lampstands of pure gold five on the right and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary the gold floral work and lamps and tongs the pure gold basins wick trimmers sprinkling bowls dishes and censers and the gold sockets for the doors of the innermost room the most holy place and also for the doors of the main hall of the temple when all the work king solomon had done for the temple of the lord was finished he brought in the things his father david had dedicated the silver and gold and the furnishings and he placed them in the treasuries of the lords temple then king solomon summoned into his presence at jerusalem the elders of israel all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the israelite families to bring up the ark of the lords covenant from zion the city of david all the men of israel came together to king solomon at the time of the festival in the month of ethanim the seventh month when all the elders of israel had arrived the priests took up the ark and they brought up the ark of the lord and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it the priests and levites carried them up and king solomon and the entire assembly of israel that had gathered about him were before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted the priests then brought the ark of the lords covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple the most holy place and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and overshadowed the ark and its carrying poles these poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary but not from outside the holy place and they are still there today there was nothing in the ark except the two stone tablets that moses had placed in it at horeb where the lord made a covenant with the israelites after they came out of egypt when the priests withdrew from the holy place the cloud filled the temple of the lord and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the lord filled his temple then solomon said the lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud i have indeed built a magnificent temple for you a place for you to dwell forever while the whole assembly of israel was standing there the king turned around and blessed them then he said praise be to the lord the god of israel who with his own hand has fulfilled what he promised with his own mouth to my father david for he said since the day i brought my people israel out of egypt i have not chosen a city in any tribe of israel to have a temple built for my name to be there but i have chosen david to rule my people israel my father david had it in his heart to build a temple for the name of the lord the god of israel but the lord said to my father david because it was in your heart to build a temple for my name you did well to have this in your heart nevertheless you are not the one to build the temple but your son who is your own flesh and blood he is the one who will build the temple for my name the lord has kept the promise he made i have succeeded david my father and now i sit on the throne of israel just as the lord promised and i have built the temple for the name of the lord the god of israel i have provided a place there for the ark in which is the covenant of the lord that he made with our fathers when he brought them out of egypt then solomon stood before the altar of the lord in front of the whole assembly of israel spread out his hands toward heaven and said o lord god of israel there is no god like you in heaven above or on earth below you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way you have kept your promise to your servant david my father with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it as it is today now lord god of israel keep for your servant david my father the promises you made to him when you said you shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of israel if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me as you have done and now o god of israel let your word that you promised your servant david my father come true but will god really dwell on earth the heavens even the highest heaven cannot contain you how much less this temple i have built yet give attention to your servants prayer and his plea for mercy o lord my god hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence this day may your eyes be open toward this temple night and day this place of which you said my name shall be there so that you will hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place hear the supplication of your servant and of your people israel when they pray toward this place hear from heaven your dwelling place and when you hear forgive when a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple then hear from heaven and act judge between your servants condemning the guilty and bringing down on his own head what he has done declare the innocent not guilty and so establish his innocence when your people israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back to you and confess your name praying and making supplication to you in this temple then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people israel and bring them back to the land you gave to their fathers when the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants your people israel teach them the right way to live and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance when famine or plague comes to the land or blight or mildew locusts or grasshoppers or when an enemy besieges them in any of their cities whatever disaster or disease may come and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people israel each one aware of the afflictions of his own heart and spreading out his hands toward this temple then hear from heaven your dwelling place forgive and act deal with each man according to all he does since you know his heart for you alone know the hearts of all men so that they will fear you all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers as for the foreigner who does not belong to your people israel but has come from a distant land because of your name for men will hear of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm when he comes and prays toward this temple then hear from heaven your dwelling place and do whatever the foreigner asks of you so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you as do your own people israel and may know that this house i have built bears your name when your people go to war against their enemies wherever you send them and when they pray to the lord toward the city you have chosen and the temple i have built for your name then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea and uphold their cause when they sin against you for there is no one who does not sin and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy who takes them captive to his own land far away or near and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive and repent and plead with you in the land of their conquerors and say we have sinned we have done wrong we have acted wickedly and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their enemies who took them captive and pray to you toward the land you gave their fathers toward the city you have chosen and the temple i have built for your name then from heaven your dwelling place hear their prayer and their plea and uphold their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you forgive all the offenses they have committed against you and cause their conquerors to show them mercy for they are your people and your inheritance whom you brought out of egypt out of that iron smelting furnace may your eyes be open to your servants plea and to the plea of your people israel and may you listen to them whenever they cry out to you for you singled them out from all the nations of the world to be your own inheritance just as you declared through your servant moses when you o sovereign lord brought our fathers out of egypt when solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the lord he rose from before the altar of the lord where he had been kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven he stood and blessed the whole assembly of israel in a loud voice saying praise be to the lord who has given rest to his people israel just as he promised not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave through his servant moses may the lord our god be with us as he was with our fathers may he never leave us nor forsake us may he turn our hearts to him to walk in all his ways and to keep the commands decrees and regulations he gave our fathers and may these words of mine which i have prayed before the lord be near to the lord our god day and night that he may uphold the cause of his servant and the cause of his people israel according to each days need so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the lord is god and that there is no other but your hearts must be fully committed to the lord our god to live by his decrees and obey his commands as at this time then the king and all israel with him offered sacrifices before the lord solomon offered a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to the lord twenty two thousand cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats so the king and all the israelites dedicated the temple of the lord on that same day the king consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the lord and there he offered burnt offerings grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar before the lord was too small to hold the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings so solomon observed the festival at that time and all israel with him a vast assembly people from lebo hamath to the wadi of egypt they celebrated it before the lord our god for seven days and seven days more fourteen days in all on the following day he sent the people away they blessed the king and then went home joyful and glad in heart for all the good things the lord had done for his servant david and his people israel when solomon had finished building the temple of the lord and the royal palace and had achieved all he had desired to do the lord appeared to him a second time as he had appeared to him at gibeon the lord said to him i have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me i have consecrated this temple which you have built by putting my name there forever my eyes and my heart will always be there as for you if you walk before me in integrity of heart and uprightness as david your father did and do all i command and observe my decrees and laws i will establish your royal throne over israel forever as i promised david your father when i said you shall never fail to have a man on the throne of israel but if you or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees i have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them then i will cut off israel from the land i have given them and will reject this temple i have consecrated for my name israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples and though this temple is now imposing all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff and say why has the lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple people will answer because they have forsaken the lord their god who brought their fathers out of egypt and have embraced other gods worshiping and serving them that is why the lord brought all this disaster on them at the end of twenty years during which solomon built these two buildings the temple of the lord and the royal palace king solomon gave twenty towns in galilee to hiram king of tyre because hiram had supplied him with all the cedar and pine and gold he wanted but when hiram went from tyre to see the towns that solomon had given him he was not pleased with them what kind of towns are these you have given me my brother he asked and he called them the land of cabul a name they have to this day now hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold here is the account of the forced labor king solomon conscripted to build the lords temple his own palace the supporting terraces the wall of jerusalem and hazor megiddo and gezer pharaoh king of egypt had attacked and captured gezer he had set it on fire he killed its canaanite inhabitants and then gave it as a wedding gift to his daughter solomons wife and solomon rebuilt gezer he built up lower beth horon baalath and tadmor in the desert within his land as well as all his store cities and the towns for his chariots and for his horses whatever he desired to build in jerusalem in lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled all the people left from the amorites hittites perizzites hivites and jebusites these peoples were not israelites that is their descendants remaining in the land whom the israelites could not exterminate these solomon conscripted for his slave labor force as it is to this day but solomon did not make slaves of any of the israelites they were his fighting men his government officials his officers his captains and the commanders of his chariots and charioteers they were also the chief officials in charge of solomons projects 550 officials supervising the men who did the work after pharaohs daughter had come up from the city of david to the palace solomon had built for her he constructed the supporting terraces three times a year solomon sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings on the altar he had built for the lord burning incense before the lord along with them and so fulfilled the temple obligations king solomon also built ships at ezion geber which is near elath in edom on the shore of the red sea and hiram sent his men sailors who knew the sea to serve in the fleet with solomons men they sailed to ophir and brought back 420 talents of gold which they delivered to king solomon when the queen of sheba heard about the fame of solomon and his relation to the name of the lord she came to test him with hard questions arriving at jerusalem with a very great caravan with camels carrying spices large quantities of gold and precious stones she came to solomon and talked with him about all that she had on her mind solomon answered all her questions nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her when the queen of sheba saw all the wisdom of solomon and the palace he had built the food on his table the seating of his officials the attending servants in their robes his cupbearers and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the lord she was overwhelmed she said to the king the report i heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true but i did not believe these things until i came and saw with my own eyes indeed not even half was told me in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded the report i heard how happy your men must be how happy your officials who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom praise be to the lord your god who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of israel because of the lords eternal love for israel he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness and she gave the king 120 talents of gold large quantities of spices and precious stones never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of sheba gave to king solomon hirams ships brought gold from ophir and from there they brought great cargoes of almugwood and precious stones the king used the almugwood to make supports for the temple of the lord and for the royal palace and to make harps and lyres for the musicians so much almugwood has never been imported or seen since that day king solomon gave the queen of sheba all she desired and asked for besides what he had given her out of his royal bounty then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country the weight of the gold that solomon received yearly was 666 talents not including the revenues from merchants and traders and from all the arabian kings and the governors of the land king solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold six hundred bekas of gold went into each shield he also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold with three minas of gold in each shield the king put them in the palace of the forest of lebanon then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with fine gold the throne had six steps and its back had a rounded top on both sides of the seat were armrests with a lion standing beside each of them twelve lions stood on the six steps one at either end of each step nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom all king solomons goblets were gold and all the household articles in the palace of the forest of lebanon were pure gold nothing was made of silver because silver was considered of little value in solomons days the king had a fleet of trading ships at sea along with the ships of hiram once every three years it returned carrying gold silver and ivory and apes and baboons king solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth the whole world sought audience with solomon to hear the wisdom god had put in his heart year after year everyone who came brought a gift articles of silver and gold robes weapons and spices and horses and mules solomon accumulated chariots and horses he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in jerusalem the king made silver as common in jerusalem as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamore fig trees in the foothills solomons horses were imported from egypt and from kue the royal merchants purchased them from kue they imported a chariot from egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they also exported them to all the kings of the hittites and of the arameans king solomon however loved many foreign women besides pharaohs daughter moabites ammonites edomites sidonians and hittites they were from nations about which the lord had told the israelites you must not intermarry with them because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods nevertheless solomon held fast to them in love he had seven hundred wives of royal birth and three hundred concubines and his wives led him astray as solomon grew old his wives turned his heart after other gods and his heart was not fully devoted to the lord his god as the heart of david his father had been he followed ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians and molech the detestable god of the ammonites so solomon did evil in the eyes of the lord he did not follow the lord completely as david his father had done on a hill east of jerusalem solomon built a high place for chemosh the detestable god of moab and for molech the detestable god of the ammonites he did the same for all his foreign wives who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods the lord became angry with solomon because his heart had turned away from the lord the god of israel who had appeared to him twice although he had forbidden solomon to follow other gods solomon did not keep the lords command so the lord said to solomon since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees which i commanded you i will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates nevertheless for the sake of david your father i will not do it during your lifetime i will tear it out of the hand of your son yet i will not tear the whole kingdom from him but will give him one tribe for the sake of david my servant and for the sake of jerusalem which i have chosen then the lord raised up against solomon an adversary hadad the edomite from the royal line of edom earlier when david was fighting with edom joab the commander of the army who had gone up to bury the dead had struck down all the men in edom joab and all the israelites stayed there for six months until they had destroyed all the men in edom but hadad still only a boy fled to egypt with some edomite officials who had served his father they set out from midian and went to paran then taking men from paran with them they went to egypt to pharaoh king of egypt who gave hadad a house and land and provided him with food pharaoh was so pleased with hadad that he gave him a sister of his own wife queen tahpenes in marriage the sister of tahpenes bore him a son named genubath whom tahpenes brought up in the royal palace there genubath lived with pharaohs own children while he was in egypt hadad heard that david rested with his fathers and that joab the commander of the army was also dead then hadad said to pharaoh let me go that i may return to my own country what have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country pharaoh asked nothing hadad replied but do let me go and god raised up against solomon another adversary rezon son of eliada who had fled from his master hadadezer king of zobah he gathered men around him and became the leader of a band of rebels when david destroyed the forces of zobah the rebels went to damascus where they settled and took control rezon was israels adversary as long as solomon lived adding to the trouble caused by hadad so rezon ruled in aram and was hostile toward israel also jeroboam son of nebat rebelled against the king he was one of solomons officials an ephraimite from zeredah and his mother was a widow named zeruah here is the account of how he rebelled against the king solomon had built the supporting terraces and had filled in the gap in the wall of the city of david his father now jeroboam was a man of standing and when solomon saw how well the young man did his work he put him in charge of the whole labor force of the house of joseph about that time jeroboam was going out of jerusalem and ahijah the prophet of shiloh met him on the way wearing a new cloak the two of them were alone out in the country and ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces then he said to jeroboam take ten pieces for yourself for this is what the lord the god of israel says see i am going to tear the kingdom out of solomons hand and give you ten tribes but for the sake of my servant david and the city of jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel he will have one tribe i will do this because they have forsaken me and worshiped ashtoreth the goddess of the sidonians chemosh the god of the moabites and molech the god of the ammonites and have not walked in my ways nor done what is right in my eyes nor kept my statutes and laws as david solomons father did but i will not take the whole kingdom out of solomons hand i have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of david my servant whom i chose and who observed my commands and statutes i will take the kingdom from his sons hands and give you ten tribes i will give one tribe to his son so that david my servant may always have a lamp before me in jerusalem the city where i chose to put my name however as for you i will take you and you will rule over all that your heart desires you will be king over israel if you do whatever i command you and walk in my ways and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and commands as david my servant did i will be with you i will build you a dynasty as enduring as the one i built for david and will give israel to you i will humble davids descendants because of this but not forever solomon tried to kill jeroboam but jeroboam fled to egypt to shishak the king and stayed there until solomons death as for the other events of solomons reign all he did and the wisdom he displayed are they not written in the book of the annals of solomon solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son succeeded him as king rehoboam went to shechem for all the israelites had gone there to make him king when jeroboam son of nebat heard this he was still in egypt where he had fled from king solomon he returned from egypt so they sent for jeroboam and he and the whole assembly of israel went to rehoboam and said to him your father put a heavy yoke on us but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us and we will serve you rehoboam answered go away for three days and then come back to me so the people went away then king rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father solomon during his lifetime how would you advise me to answer these people he asked they replied if today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants but rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him he asked them what is your advice how should we answer these people who say to me lighten the yoke your father put on us the young men who had grown up with him replied tell these people who have said to you your father put a heavy yoke on us but make our yoke lighter tell them my little finger is thicker than my fathers waist my father laid on you a heavy yoke i will make it even heavier my father scourged you with whips i will scourge you with scorpions three days later jeroboam and all the people returned to rehoboam as the king had said come back to me in three days the king answered the people harshly rejecting the advice given him by the elders he followed the advice of the young men and said my father made your yoke heavy i will make it even heavier my father scourged you with whips i will scourge you with scorpions so the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was from the lord to fulfill the word the lord had spoken to jeroboam son of nebat through ahijah the shilonite when all israel saw that the king refused to listen to them they answered the king what share do we have in david what part in jesses son to your tents o israel look after your own house o david so the israelites went home but as for the israelites who were living in the towns of judah rehoboam still ruled over them king rehoboam sent out adoniram who was in charge of forced labor but all israel stoned him to death king rehoboam however managed to get into his chariot and escape to jerusalem so israel has been in rebellion against the house of david to this day when all the israelites heard that jeroboam had returned they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all israel only the tribe of judah remained loyal to the house of david when rehoboam arrived in jerusalem he mustered the whole house of judah and the tribe of benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men to make war against the house of israel and to regain the kingdom for rehoboam son of solomon but this word of god came to shemaiah the man of god say to rehoboam son of solomon king of judah to the whole house of judah and benjamin and to the rest of the people this is what the lord says do not go up to fight against your brothers the israelites go home every one of you for this is my doing so they obeyed the word of the lord and went home again as the lord had ordered then jeroboam fortified shechem in the hill country of ephraim and lived there from there he went out and built up peniel jeroboam thought to himself the kingdom will now likely revert to the house of david if these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the lord in jerusalem they will again give their allegiance to their lord rehoboam king of judah they will kill me and return to king rehoboam after seeking advice the king made two golden calves he said to the people it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem here are your gods o israel who brought you up out of egypt one he set up in bethel and the other in dan and this thing became a sin the people went even as far as dan to worship the one there jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests from all sorts of people even though they were not levites he instituted a festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the festival held in judah and offered sacrifices on the altar this he did in bethel sacrificing to the calves he had made and at bethel he also installed priests at the high places he had made on the fifteenth day of the eighth month a month of his own choosing he offered sacrifices on the altar he had built at bethel so he instituted the festival for the israelites and went up to the altar to make offerings by the word of the lord a man of god came from judah to bethel as jeroboam was standing by the altar to make an offering he cried out against the altar by the word of the lord o altar altar this is what the lord says a son named josiah will be born to the house of david on you he will sacrifice the priests of the high places who now make offerings here and human bones will be burned on you that same day the man of god gave a sign this is the sign the lord has declared the altar will be split apart and the ashes on it will be poured out when king jeroboam heard what the man of god cried out against the altar at bethel he stretched out his hand from the altar and said seize him but the hand he stretched out toward the man shriveled up so that he could not pull it back also the altar was split apart and its ashes poured out according to the sign given by the man of god by the word of the lord then the king said to the man of god intercede with the lord your god and pray for me that my hand may be restored so the man of god interceded with the lord and the kings hand was restored and became as it was before the king said to the man of god come home with me and have something to eat and i will give you a gift but the man of god answered the king even if you were to give me half your possessions i would not go with you nor would i eat bread or drink water here for i was commanded by the word of the lord you must not eat bread or drink water or return by the way you came so he took another road and did not return by the way he had come to bethel now there was a certain old prophet living in bethel whose sons came and told him all that the man of god had done there that day they also told their father what he had said to the king their father asked them which way did he go and his sons showed him which road the man of god from judah had taken so he said to his sons saddle the donkey for me and when they had saddled the donkey for him he mounted it and rode after the man of god he found him sitting under an oak tree and asked are you the man of god who came from judahi am he replied so the prophet said to him come home with me and eat the man of god said i cannot turn back and go with you nor can i eat bread or drink water with you in this place i have been told by the word of the lord you must not eat bread or drink water there or return by the way you came the old prophet answered i too am a prophet as you are and an angel said to me by the word of the lord bring him back with you to your house so that he may eat bread and drink water but he was lying to him so the man of god returned with him and ate and drank in his house while they were sitting at the table the word of the lord came to the old prophet who had brought him back he cried out to the man of god who had come from judah this is what the lord says you have defied the word of the lord and have not kept the command the lord your god gave you you came back and ate bread and drank water in the place where he told you not to eat or drink therefore your body will not be buried in the tomb of your fathers when the man of god had finished eating and drinking the prophet who had brought him back saddled his donkey for him as he went on his way a lion met him on the road and killed him and his body was thrown down on the road with both the donkey and the lion standing beside it some people who passed by saw the body thrown down there with the lion standing beside the body and they went and reported it in the city where the old prophet lived when the prophet who had brought him back from his journey heard of it he said it is the man of god who defied the word of the lord the lord has given him over to the lion which has mauled him and killed him as the word of the lord had warned him the prophet said to his sons saddle the donkey for me and they did so then he went out and found the body thrown down on the road with the donkey and the lion standing beside it the lion had neither eaten the body nor mauled the donkey so the prophet picked up the body of the man of god laid it on the donkey and brought it back to his own city to mourn for him and bury him then he laid the body in his own tomb and they mourned over him and said oh my brother after burying him he said to his sons when i die bury me in the grave where the man of god is buried lay my bones beside his bones for the message he declared by the word of the lord against the altar in bethel and against all the shrines on the high places in the towns of samaria will certainly come true even after this jeroboam did not change his evil ways but once more appointed priests for the high places from all sorts of people anyone who wanted to become a priest he consecrated for the high places this was the sin of the house of jeroboam that led to its downfall and to its destruction from the face of the earth at that time abijah son of jeroboam became ill and jeroboam said to his wife go disguise yourself so you wont be recognized as the wife of jeroboam then go to shiloh ahijah the prophet is there the one who told me i would be king over this people take ten loaves of bread with you some cakes and a jar of honey and go to him he will tell you what will happen to the boy so jeroboams wife did what he said and went to ahijahs house in shiloh now ahijah could not see his sight was gone because of his age but the lord had told ahijah jeroboams wife is coming to ask you about her son for he is ill and you are to give her such and such an answer when she arrives she will pretend to be someone else so when ahijah heard the sound of her footsteps at the door he said come in wife of jeroboam why this pretense i have been sent to you with bad news go tell jeroboam that this is what the lord the god of israel says i raised you up from among the people and made you a leader over my people israel i tore the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it to you but you have not been like my servant david who kept my commands and followed me with all his heart doing only what was right in my eyes you have done more evil than all who lived before you you have made for yourself other gods idols made of metal you have provoked me to anger and thrust me behind your back because of this i am going to bring disaster on the house of jeroboam i will cut off from jeroboam every last male in israel slave or free i will burn up the house of jeroboam as one burns dung until it is all gone dogs will eat those belonging to jeroboam who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country the lord has spoken as for you go back home when you set foot in your city the boy will die all israel will mourn for him and bury him he is the only one belonging to jeroboam who will be buried because he is the only one in the house of jeroboam in whom the lord the god of israel has found anything good the lord will raise up for himself a king over israel who will cut off the family of jeroboam this is the day what yes even now and the lord will strike israel so that it will be like a reed swaying in the water he will uproot israel from this good land that he gave to their forefathers and scatter them beyond the river because they provoked the lord to anger by making asherah poles and he will give israel up because of the sins jeroboam has committed and has caused israel to commit then jeroboams wife got up and left and went to tirzah as soon as she stepped over the threshold of the house the boy died they buried him and all israel mourned for him as the lord had said through his servant the prophet ahijah the other events of jeroboams reign his wars and how he ruled are written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel he reigned for twenty two years and then rested with his fathers and nadab his son succeeded him as king rehoboam son of solomon was king in judah he was forty one years old when he became king and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel in which to put his name his mothers name was naamah she was an ammonite judah did evil in the eyes of the lord by the sins they committed they stirred up his jealous anger more than their fathers had done they also set up for themselves high places sacred stones and asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree there were even male shrine prostitutes in the land the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the lord had driven out before the israelites in the fifth year of king rehoboam shishak king of egypt attacked jerusalem he carried off the treasures of the temple of the lord and the treasures of the royal palace he took everything including all the gold shields solomon had made so king rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace whenever the king went to the lords temple the guards bore the shields and afterward they returned them to the guardroom as for the other events of rehoboams reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah there was continual warfare between rehoboam and jeroboam and rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of david his mothers name was naamah she was an ammonite and abijah his son succeeded him as king in the eighteenth year of the reign of jeroboam son of nebat abijah became king of judah and he reigned in jerusalem three years his mothers name was maacah daughter of abishalom he committed all the sins his father had done before him his heart was not fully devoted to the lord his god as the heart of david his forefather had been nevertheless for davids sake the lord his god gave him a lamp in jerusalem by raising up a son to succeed him and by making jerusalem strong for david had done what was right in the eyes of the lord and had not failed to keep any of the lords commands all the days of his life except in the case of uriah the hittite there was war between rehoboam and jeroboam throughout abijahs lifetime as for the other events of abijahs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah there was war between abijah and jeroboam and abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and asa his son succeeded him as king in the twentieth year of jeroboam king of israel asa became king of judah and he reigned in jerusalem forty one years his grandmothers name was maacah daughter of abishalom asa did what was right in the eyes of the lord as his father david had done he expelled the male shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made he even deposed his grandmother maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive asherah pole asa cut the pole down and burned it in the kidron valley although he did not remove the high places asas heart was fully committed to the lord all his life he brought into the temple of the lord the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated there was war between asa and baasha king of israel throughout their reigns baasha king of israel went up against judah and fortified ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of asa king of judah asa then took all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the lords temple and of his own palace he entrusted it to his officials and sent them to ben hadad son of tabrimmon the son of hezion the king of aram who was ruling in damascus let there be a treaty between me and you he said as there was between my father and your father see i am sending you a gift of silver and gold now break your treaty with baasha king of israel so he will withdraw from me ben hadad agreed with king asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of israel he conquered ijon dan abel beth maacah and all kinnereth in addition to naphtali when baasha heard this he stopped building ramah and withdrew to tirzah then king asa issued an order to all judah no one was exempt and they carried away from ramah the stones and timber baasha had been using there with them king asa built up geba in benjamin and also mizpah as for all the other events of asas reign all his achievements all he did and the cities he built are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah in his old age however his feet became diseased then asa rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of his father david and jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king nadab son of jeroboam became king of israel in the second year of asa king of judah and he reigned over israel two years he did evil in the eyes of the lord walking in the ways of his father and in his sin which he had caused israel to commit baasha son of ahijah of the house of issachar plotted against him and he struck him down at gibbethon a philistine town while nadab and all israel were besieging it baasha killed nadab in the third year of asa king of judah and succeeded him as king as soon as he began to reign he killed jeroboams whole family he did not leave jeroboam anyone that breathed but destroyed them all according to the word of the lord given through his servant ahijah the shilonite because of the sins jeroboam had committed and had caused israel to commit and because he provoked the lord the god of israel to anger as for the other events of nadabs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel there was war between asa and baasha king of israel throughout their reigns in the third year of asa king of judah baasha son of ahijah became king of all israel in tirzah and he reigned twenty four years he did evil in the eyes of the lord walking in the ways of jeroboam and in his sin which he had caused israel to commit then the word of the lord came to jehu son of hanani against baasha i lifted you up from the dust and made you leader of my people israel but you walked in the ways of jeroboam and caused my people israel to sin and to provoke me to anger by their sins so i am about to consume baasha and his house and i will make your house like that of jeroboam son of nebat dogs will eat those belonging to baasha who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country as for the other events of baashas reign what he did and his achievements are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel baasha rested with his fathers and was buried in tirzah and elah his son succeeded him as king moreover the word of the lord came through the prophet jehu son of hanani to baasha and his house because of all the evil he had done in the eyes of the lord provoking him to anger by the things he did and becoming like the house of jeroboam and also because he destroyed it in the twenty sixth year of asa king of judah elah son of baasha became king of israel and he reigned in tirzah two years zimri one of his officials who had command of half his chariots plotted against him elah was in tirzah at the time getting drunk in the home of arza the man in charge of the palace at tirzah zimri came in struck him down and killed him in the twenty seventh year of asa king of judah then he succeeded him as king as soon as he began to reign and was seated on the throne he killed off baashas whole family he did not spare a single male whether relative or friend so zimri destroyed the whole family of baasha in accordance with the word of the lord spoken against baasha through the prophet jehu because of all the sins baasha and his son elah had committed and had caused israel to commit so that they provoked the lord the god of israel to anger by their worthless idols as for the other events of elahs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel in the twenty seventh year of asa king of judah zimri reigned in tirzah seven days the army was encamped near gibbethon a philistine town when the israelites in the camp heard that zimri had plotted against the king and murdered him they proclaimed omri the commander of the army king over israel that very day there in the camp then omri and all the israelites with him withdrew from gibbethon and laid siege to tirzah when zimri saw that the city was taken he went into the citadel of the royal palace and set the palace on fire around him so he died because of the sins he had committed doing evil in the eyes of the lord and walking in the ways of jeroboam and in the sin he had committed and had caused israel to commit as for the other events of zimris reign and the rebellion he carried out are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel then the people of israel were split into two factions half supported tibni son of ginath for king and the other half supported omri but omris followers proved stronger than those of tibni son of ginath so tibni died and omri became king in the thirty first year of asa king of judah omri became king of israel and he reigned twelve years six of them in tirzah he bought the hill of samaria from shemer for two talents of silver and built a city on the hill calling it samaria after shemer the name of the former owner of the hill but omri did evil in the eyes of the lord and sinned more than all those before him he walked in all the ways of jeroboam son of nebat and in his sin which he had caused israel to commit so that they provoked the lord the god of israel to anger by their worthless idols as for the other events of omris reign what he did and the things he achieved are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel omri rested with his fathers and was buried in samaria and ahab his son succeeded him as king in the thirty eighth year of asa king of judah ahab son of omri became king of israel and he reigned in samaria over israel twenty two years ahab son of omri did more evil in the eyes of the lord than any of those before him he not only considered it trivial to commit the sins of jeroboam son of nebat but he also married jezebel daughter of ethbaal king of the sidonians and began to serve baal and worship him he set up an altar for baal in the temple of baal that he built in samaria ahab also made an asherah pole and did more to provoke the lord the god of israel to anger than did all the kings of israel before him in ahabs time hiel of bethel rebuilt jericho he laid its foundations at the cost of his firstborn son abiram and he set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son segub in accordance with the word of the lord spoken by joshua son of nun now elijah the tishbite from tishbe in gilead said to ahab as the lord the god of israel lives whom i serve there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except at my word then the word of the lord came to elijah leave here turn eastward and hide in the kerith ravine east of the jordan you will drink from the brook and i have ordered the ravens to feed you there so he did what the lord had told him he went to the kerith ravine east of the jordan and stayed there the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and bread and meat in the evening and he drank from the brook some time later the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land then the word of the lord came to him go at once to zarephath of sidon and stay there i have commanded a widow in that place to supply you with food so he went to zarephath when he came to the town gate a widow was there gathering sticks he called to her and asked would you bring me a little water in a jar so i may have a drink as she was going to get it he called and bring me please a piece of bread as surely as the lord your god lives she replied i dont have any bread only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug i am gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son that we may eat it and die elijah said to her dont be afraid go home and do as you have said but first make a small cake of bread for me from what you have and bring it to me and then make something for yourself and your son for this is what the lord the god of israel says the jar of flour will not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the lord gives rain on the land she went away and did as elijah had told her so there was food every day for elijah and for the woman and her family for the jar of flour was not used up and the jug of oil did not run dry in keeping with the word of the lord spoken by elijah some time later the son of the woman who owned the house became ill he grew worse and worse and finally stopped breathing she said to elijah what do you have against me man of god did you come to remind me of my sin and kill my son give me your son elijah replied he took him from her arms carried him to the upper room where he was staying and laid him on his bed then he cried out to the lord o lord my god have you brought tragedy also upon this widow i am staying with by causing her son to die then he stretched himself out on the boy three times and cried to the lord o lord my god let this boys life return to him the lord heard elijahs cry and the boys life returned to him and he lived elijah picked up the child and carried him down from the room into the house he gave him to his mother and said look your son is alive then the woman said to elijah now i know that you are a man of god and that the word of the lord from your mouth is the truth after a long time in the third year the word of the lord came to elijah go and present yourself to ahab and i will send rain on the land so elijah went to present himself to ahab now the famine was severe in samaria and ahab had summoned obadiah who was in charge of his palace obadiah was a devout believer in the lord while jezebel was killing off the lords prophets obadiah had taken a hundred prophets and hidden them in two caves fifty in each and had supplied them with food and water ahab had said to obadiah go through the land to all the springs and valleys maybe we can find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive so we will not have to kill any of our animals so they divided the land they were to cover ahab going in one direction and obadiah in another as obadiah was walking along elijah met him obadiah recognized him bowed down to the ground and said is it really you my lord elijah yes he replied go tell your master elijah is here what have i done wrong asked obadiah that you are handing your servant over to ahab to be put to death as surely as the lord your god lives there is not a nation or kingdom where my master has not sent someone to look for you and whenever a nation or kingdom claimed you were not there he made them swear they could not find you but now you tell me to go to my master and say elijah is here i dont know where the spirit of the lord may carry you when i leave you if i go and tell ahab and he doesnt find you he will kill me yet i your servant have worshiped the lord since my youth havent you heard my lord what i did while jezebel was killing the prophets of the lord i hid a hundred of the lords prophets in two caves fifty in each and supplied them with food and water and now you tell me to go to my master and say elijah is here he will kill me elijah said as the lord almighty lives whom i serve i will surely present myself to ahab today so obadiah went to meet ahab and told him and ahab went to meet elijah when he saw elijah he said to him is that you you troubler of israel i have not made trouble for israel elijah replied but you and your fathers family have you have abandoned the lords commands and have followed the baals now summon the people from all over israel to meet me on mount carmel and bring the four hundred and fifty prophets of baal and the four hundred prophets of asherah who eat at jezebels table so ahab sent word throughout all israel and assembled the prophets on mount carmel elijah went before the people and said how long will you waver between two opinions if the lord is god follow him but if baal is god follow him but the people said nothing then elijah said to them i am the only one of the lords prophets left but baal has four hundred and fifty prophets get two bulls for us let them choose one for themselves and let them cut it into pieces and put it on the wood but not set fire to it i will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood but not set fire to it then you call on the name of your god and i will call on the name of the lord the god who answers by fire he is god then all the people said what you say is good elijah said to the prophets of baal choose one of the bulls and prepare it first since there are so many of you call on the name of your god but do not light the fire so they took the bull given them and prepared it then they called on the name of baal from morning till noon o baal answer us they shouted but there was no response no one answered and they danced around the altar they had made at noon elijah began to taunt them shout louder he said surely he is a god perhaps he is deep in thought or busy or traveling maybe he is sleeping and must be awakened so they shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears as was their custom until their blood flowed midday passed and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time for the evening sacrifice but there was no response no one answered no one paid attention then elijah said to all the people come here to me they came to him and he repaired the altar of the lord which was in ruins elijah took twelve stones one for each of the tribes descended from jacob to whom the word of the lord had come saying your name shall be israel with the stones he built an altar in the name of the lord and he dug a trench around it large enough to hold two seahs of seed he arranged the wood cut the bull into pieces and laid it on the wood then he said to them fill four large jars with water and pour it on the offering and on the wood do it again he said and they did it again do it a third time he ordered and they did it the third time the water ran down around the altar and even filled the trench at the time of sacrifice the prophet elijah stepped forward and prayed o lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known today that you are god in israel and that i am your servant and have done all these things at your command answer me o lord answer me so these people will know that you o lord are god and that you are turning their hearts back again then the fire of the lord fell and burned up the sacrifice the wood the stones and the soil and also licked up the water in the trench when all the people saw this they fell prostrate and cried the lord he is god the lord he is god then elijah commanded them seize the prophets of baal dont let anyone get away they seized them and elijah had them brought down to the kishon valley and slaughtered there and elijah said to ahab go eat and drink for there is the sound of a heavy rain so ahab went off to eat and drink but elijah climbed to the top of carmel bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees go and look toward the sea he told his servant and he went up and looked there is nothing there he said seven times elijah said go back the seventh time the servant reported a cloud as small as a mans hand is rising from the sea so elijah said go and tell ahab hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you meanwhile the sky grew black with clouds the wind rose a heavy rain came on and ahab rode off to jezreel the power of the lord came upon elijah and tucking his cloak into his belt he ran ahead of ahab all the way to jezreel now ahab told jezebel everything elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword so jezebel sent a messenger to elijah to say may the gods deal with me be it ever so severely if by this time tomorrow i do not make your life like that of one of them elijah was afraid and ran for his life when he came to beersheba in judah he left his servant there while he himself went a days journey into the desert he came to a broom tree sat down under it and prayed that he might die i have had enough lord he said take my life i am no better than my ancestors then he lay down under the tree and fell asleep all at once an angel touched him and said get up and eat he looked around and there by his head was a cake of bread baked over hot coals and a jar of water he ate and drank and then lay down again the angel of the lord came back a second time and touched him and said get up and eat for the journey is too much for you so he got up and ate and drank strengthened by that food he traveled forty days and forty nights until he reached horeb the mountain of god there he went into a cave and spent the night and the word of the lord came to him what are you doing here elijah he replied i have been very zealous for the lord god almighty the israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too the lord said go out and stand on the mountain in the presence of the lord for the lord is about to pass by then a great and powerful wind tore the mountains apart and shattered the rocks before the lord but the lord was not in the wind after the wind there was an earthquake but the lord was not in the earthquake after the earthquake came a fire but the lord was not in the fire and after the fire came a gentle whisper when elijah heard it he pulled his cloak over his face and went out and stood at the mouth of the cave then a voice said to him what are you doing here elijah he replied i have been very zealous for the lord god almighty the israelites have rejected your covenant broken down your altars and put your prophets to death with the sword i am the only one left and now they are trying to kill me too the lord said to him go back the way you came and go to the desert of damascus when you get there anoint hazael king over aram also anoint jehu son of nimshi king over israel and anoint elisha son of shaphat from abel meholah to succeed you as prophet jehu will put to death any who escape the sword of hazael and elisha will put to death any who escape the sword of jehu yet i reserve seven thousand in israel all whose knees have not bowed down to baal and all whose mouths have not kissed him so elijah went from there and found elisha son of shaphat he was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen and he himself was driving the twelfth pair elijah went up to him and threw his cloak around him elisha then left his oxen and ran after elijah let me kiss my father and mother good by he said and then i will come with yougo back elijah replied what have i done to you so elisha left him and went back he took his yoke of oxen and slaughtered them he burned the plowing equipment to cook the meat and gave it to the people and they ate then he set out to follow elijah and became his attendant now ben hadad king of aram mustered his entire army accompanied by thirty two kings with their horses and chariots he went up and besieged samaria and attacked it he sent messengers into the city to ahab king of israel saying this is what ben hadad says your silver and gold are mine and the best of your wives and children are mine the king of israel answered just as you say my lord the king i and all i have are yours the messengers came again and said this is what ben hadad says i sent to demand your silver and gold your wives and your children but about this time tomorrow i am going to send my officials to search your palace and the houses of your officials they will seize everything you value and carry it away the king of israel summoned all the elders of the land and said to them see how this man is looking for trouble when he sent for my wives and my children my silver and my gold i did not refuse him the elders and the people all answered dont listen to him or agree to his demands so he replied to ben hadads messengers tell my lord the king your servant will do all you demanded the first time but this demand i cannot meet they left and took the answer back to ben hadad then ben hadad sent another message to ahab may the gods deal with me be it ever so severely if enough dust remains in samaria to give each of my men a handful the king of israel answered tell him one who puts on his armor should not boast like one who takes it off ben hadad heard this message while he and the kings were drinking in their tents and he ordered his men prepare to attack so they prepared to attack the city meanwhile a prophet came to ahab king of israel and announced this is what the lord says do you see this vast army i will give it into your hand today and then you will know that i am the lord but who will do this asked ahab the prophet replied this is what the lord says the young officers of the provincial commanders will do it and who will start the battle he asked the prophet answered you will so ahab summoned the young officers of the provincial commanders 232 men then he assembled the rest of the israelites 7000 in all they set out at noon while ben hadad and the 32 kings allied with him were in their tents getting drunk the young officers of the provincial commanders went out first now ben hadad had dispatched scouts who reported men are advancing from samaria he said if they have come out for peace take them alive if they have come out for war take them alive the young officers of the provincial commanders marched out of the city with the army behind them and each one struck down his opponent at that the arameans fled with the israelites in pursuit but ben hadad king of aram escaped on horseback with some of his horsemen the king of israel advanced and overpowered the horses and chariots and inflicted heavy losses on the arameans afterward the prophet came to the king of israel and said strengthen your position and see what must be done because next spring the king of aram will attack you again meanwhile the officials of the king of aram advised him their gods are gods of the hills that is why they were too strong for us but if we fight them on the plains surely we will be stronger than they do this remove all the kings from their commands and replace them with other officers you must also raise an army like the one you lost horse for horse and chariot for chariot so we can fight israel on the plains then surely we will be stronger than they he agreed with them and acted accordingly the next spring ben hadad mustered the arameans and went up to aphek to fight against israel when the israelites were also mustered and given provisions they marched out to meet them the israelites camped opposite them like two small flocks of goats while the arameans covered the countryside the man of god came up and told the king of israel this is what the lord says because the arameans think the lord is a god of the hills and not a god of the valleys i will deliver this vast army into your hands and you will know that i am the lord for seven days they camped opposite each other and on the seventh day the battle was joined the israelites inflicted a hundred thousand casualties on the aramean foot soldiers in one day the rest of them escaped to the city of aphek where the wall collapsed on twenty seven thousand of them and ben hadad fled to the city and hid in an inner room his officials said to him look we have heard that the kings of the house of israel are merciful let us go to the king of israel with sackcloth around our waists and ropes around our heads perhaps he will spare your life wearing sackcloth around their waists and ropes around their heads they went to the king of israel and said your servant ben hadad says please let me live the king answered is he still alive he is my brother the men took this as a good sign and were quick to pick up his word yes your brother ben hadad they said go and get him the king said when ben hadad came out ahab had him come up into his chariot i will return the cities my father took from your father ben hadad offered you may set up your own market areas in damascus as my father did in samaria ahab said on the basis of a treaty i will set you free so he made a treaty with him and let him go by the word of the lord one of the sons of the prophets said to his companion strike me with your weapon but the man refused so the prophet said because you have not obeyed the lord as soon as you leave me a lion will kill you and after the man went away a lion found him and killed him the prophet found another man and said strike me please so the man struck him and wounded him then the prophet went and stood by the road waiting for the king he disguised himself with his headband down over his eyes as the king passed by the prophet called out to him your servant went into the thick of the battle and someone came to me with a captive and said guard this man if he is missing it will be your life for his life or you must pay a talent of silver while your servant was busy here and there the man disappearedthat is your sentence the king of israel said you have pronounced it yourself then the prophet quickly removed the headband from his eyes and the king of israel recognized him as one of the prophets he said to the king this is what the lord says you have set free a man i had determined should die therefore it is your life for his life your people for his people sullen and angry the king of israel went to his palace in samaria some time later there was an incident involving a vineyard belonging to naboth the jezreelite the vineyard was in jezreel close to the palace of ahab king of samaria ahab said to naboth let me have your vineyard to use for a vegetable garden since it is close to my palace in exchange i will give you a better vineyard or if you prefer i will pay you whatever it is worth but naboth replied the lord forbid that i should give you the inheritance of my fathers so ahab went home sullen and angry because naboth the jezreelite had said i will not give you the inheritance of my fathers he lay on his bed sulking and refused to eat his wife jezebel came in and asked him why are you so sullen why wont you eat he answered her because i said to naboth the jezreelite sell me your vineyard or if you prefer i will give you another vineyard in its place but he said i will not give you my vineyard jezebel his wife said is this how you act as king over israel get up and eat cheer up ill get you the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite so she wrote letters in ahabs name placed his seal on them and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived in naboths city with him in those letters she wrote proclaim a day of fasting and seat naboth in a prominent place among the people but seat two scoundrels opposite him and have them testify that he has cursed both god and the king then take him out and stone him to death so the elders and nobles who lived in naboths city did as jezebel directed in the letters she had written to them they proclaimed a fast and seated naboth in a prominent place among the people then two scoundrels came and sat opposite him and brought charges against naboth before the people saying naboth has cursed both god and the king so they took him outside the city and stoned him to death then they sent word to jezebel naboth has been stoned and is dead as soon as jezebel heard that naboth had been stoned to death she said to ahab get up and take possession of the vineyard of naboth the jezreelite that he refused to sell you he is no longer alive but dead when ahab heard that naboth was dead he got up and went down to take possession of naboths vineyard then the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite go down to meet ahab king of israel who rules in samaria he is now in naboths vineyard where he has gone to take possession of it say to him this is what the lord says have you not murdered a man and seized his property then say to him this is what the lord says in the place where dogs licked up naboths blood dogs will lick up your blood yes yours ahab said to elijah so you have found me my enemyi have found you he answered because you have sold yourself to do evil in the eyes of the lord i am going to bring disaster on you i will consume your descendants and cut off from ahab every last male in israel slave or free i will make your house like that of jeroboam son of nebat and that of baasha son of ahijah because you have provoked me to anger and have caused israel to sin and also concerning jezebel the lord says dogs will devour jezebel by the wall of jezreel dogs will eat those belonging to ahab who die in the city and the birds of the air will feed on those who die in the country there was never a man like ahab who sold himself to do evil in the eyes of the lord urged on by jezebel his wife he behaved in the vilest manner by going after idols like the amorites the lord drove out before israel when ahab heard these words he tore his clothes put on sackcloth and fasted he lay in sackcloth and went around meekly then the word of the lord came to elijah the tishbite have you noticed how ahab has humbled himself before me because he has humbled himself i will not bring this disaster in his day but i will bring it on his house in the days of his son for three years there was no war between aram and israel but in the third year jehoshaphat king of judah went down to see the king of israel the king of israel had said to his officials dont you know that ramoth gilead belongs to us and yet we are doing nothing to retake it from the king of aram so he asked jehoshaphat will you go with me to fight against ramoth gilead jehoshaphat replied to the king of israel i am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses but jehoshaphat also said to the king of israel first seek the counsel of the lord so the king of israel brought together the prophets about four hundred men and asked them shall i go to war against ramoth gilead or shall i refraingo they answered for the lord will give it into the kings hand but jehoshaphat asked is there not a prophet of the lord here whom we can inquire of the king of israel answered jehoshaphat there is still one man through whom we can inquire of the lord but i hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me but always bad he is micaiah son of imlahthe king should not say that jehoshaphat replied so the king of israel called one of his officials and said bring micaiah son of imlah at once dressed in their royal robes the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance of the gate of samaria with all the prophets prophesying before them now zedekiah son of kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared this is what the lord says with these you will gore the arameans until they are destroyed all the other prophets were prophesying the same thing attack ramoth gilead and be victorious they said for the lord will give it into the kings hand the messenger who had gone to summon micaiah said to him look as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king let your word agree with theirs and speak favorably but micaiah said as surely as the lord lives i can tell him only what the lord tells me when he arrived the king asked him micaiah shall we go to war against ramoth gilead or shall i refrainattack and be victorious he answered for the lord will give it into the kings hand the king said to him how many times must i make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the lord then micaiah answered i saw all israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd and the lord said these people have no master let each one go home in peace the king of israel said to jehoshaphat didnt i tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me but only bad micaiah continued therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing around him on his right and on his left and the lord said who will entice ahab into attacking ramoth gilead and going to his death thereone suggested this and another that finally a spirit came forward stood before the lord and said i will entice him by what means the lord asked i will go out and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets he said you will succeed in enticing him said the lord go and do it so now the lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all these prophets of yours the lord has decreed disaster for you then zedekiah son of kenaanah went up and slapped micaiah in the face which way did the spirit from the lord go when he went from me to speak to you he asked micaiah replied you will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room the king of israel then ordered take micaiah and send him back to amon the ruler of the city and to joash the kings son and say this is what the king says put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until i return safely micaiah declared if you ever return safely the lord has not spoken through me then he added mark my words all you people so the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah went up to ramoth gilead the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will enter the battle in disguise but you wear your royal robes so the king of israel disguised himself and went into battle now the king of aram had ordered his thirty two chariot commanders do not fight with anyone small or great except the king of israel when the chariot commanders saw jehoshaphat they thought surely this is the king of israel so they turned to attack him but when jehoshaphat cried out the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of israel and stopped pursuing him but someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of israel between the sections of his armor the king told his chariot driver wheel around and get me out of the fighting ive been wounded all day long the battle raged and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the arameans the blood from his wound ran onto the floor of the chariot and that evening he died as the sun was setting a cry spread through the army every man to his town everyone to his land so the king died and was brought to samaria and they buried him there they washed the chariot at a pool in samaria where the prostitutes bathed and the dogs licked up his blood as the word of the lord had declared as for the other events of ahabs reign including all he did the palace he built and inlaid with ivory and the cities he fortified are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel ahab rested with his fathers and ahaziah his son succeeded him as king jehoshaphat son of asa became king of judah in the fourth year of ahab king of israel jehoshaphat was thirty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem twenty five years his mothers name was azubah daughter of shilhi in everything he walked in the ways of his father asa and did not stray from them he did what was right in the eyes of the lord the high places however were not removed and the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there jehoshaphat was also at peace with the king of israel as for the other events of jehoshaphats reign the things he achieved and his military exploits are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah he rid the land of the rest of the male shrine prostitutes who remained there even after the reign of his father asa there was then no king in edom a deputy ruled now jehoshaphat built a fleet of trading ships to go to ophir for gold but they never set sail they were wrecked at ezion geber at that time ahaziah son of ahab said to jehoshaphat let my men sail with your men but jehoshaphat refused then jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of david his father and jehoram his son succeeded him ahaziah son of ahab became king of israel in samaria in the seventeenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and he reigned over israel two years he did evil in the eyes of the lord because he walked in the ways of his father and mother and in the ways of jeroboam son of nebat who caused israel to sin he served and worshiped baal and provoked the lord the god of israel to anger just as his father had done  after ahabs death moab rebelled against israel now ahaziah had fallen through the lattice of his upper room in samaria and injured himself so he sent messengers saying to them go and consult baal zebub the god of ekron to see if i will recover from this injury but the angel of the lord said to elijah the tishbite go up and meet the messengers of the king of samaria and ask them is it because there is no god in israel that you are going off to consult baal zebub the god of ekron therefore this is what the lord says you will not leave the bed you are lying on you will certainly die so elijah went when the messengers returned to the king he asked them why have you come back a man came to meet us they replied and he said to us go back to the king who sent you and tell him this is what the lord says is it because there is no god in israel that you are sending men to consult baal zebub the god of ekron therefore you will not leave the bed you are lying on you will certainly die the king asked them what kind of man was it who came to meet you and told you this they replied he was a man with a garment of hair and with a leather belt around his waist the king said that was elijah the tishbite then he sent to elijah a captain with his company of fifty men the captain went up to elijah who was sitting on the top of a hill and said to him man of god the king says come down elijah answered the captain if i am a man of god may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men then fire fell from heaven and consumed the captain and his men at this the king sent to elijah another captain with his fifty men the captain said to him man of god this is what the king says come down at once if i am a man of god elijah replied may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty men then the fire of god fell from heaven and consumed him and his fifty men so the king sent a third captain with his fifty men this third captain went up and fell on his knees before elijah man of god he begged please have respect for my life and the lives of these fifty men your servants see fire has fallen from heaven and consumed the first two captains and all their men but now have respect for my life the angel of the lord said to elijah go down with him do not be afraid of him so elijah got up and went down with him to the king he told the king this is what the lord says is it because there is no god in israel for you to consult that you have sent messengers to consult baal zebub the god of ekron because you have done this you will never leave the bed you are lying on you will certainly die so he died according to the word of the lord that elijah had spoken because ahaziah had no son joram succeeded him as king in the second year of jehoram son of jehoshaphat king of judah as for all the other events of ahaziahs reign and what he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel when the lord was about to take elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind elijah and elisha were on their way from gilgal elijah said to elisha stay here the lord has sent me to bethel but elisha said as surely as the lord lives and as you live i will not leave you so they went down to bethel the company of the prophets at bethel came out to elisha and asked do you know that the lord is going to take your master from you todayyes i know elisha replied but do not speak of it then elijah said to him stay here elisha the lord has sent me to jericho and he replied as surely as the lord lives and as you live i will not leave you so they went to jericho the company of the prophets at jericho went up to elisha and asked him do you know that the lord is going to take your master from you todayyes i know he replied but do not speak of it then elijah said to him stay here the lord has sent me to the jordan and he replied as surely as the lord lives and as you live i will not leave you so the two of them walked on fifty men of the company of the prophets went and stood at a distance facing the place where elijah and elisha had stopped at the jordan elijah took his cloak rolled it up and struck the water with it the water divided to the right and to the left and the two of them crossed over on dry ground when they had crossed elijah said to elisha tell me what can i do for you before i am taken from youlet me inherit a double portion of your spirit elisha replied you have asked a difficult thing elijah said yet if you see me when i am taken from you it will be yours otherwise not as they were walking along and talking together suddenly a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared and separated the two of them and elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind elisha saw this and cried out my father my father the chariots and horsemen of israel and elisha saw him no more then he took hold of his own clothes and tore them apart he picked up the cloak that had fallen from elijah and went back and stood on the bank of the jordan then he took the cloak that had fallen from him and struck the water with it where now is the lord the god of elijah he asked when he struck the water it divided to the right and to the left and he crossed over the company of the prophets from jericho who were watching said the spirit of elijah is resting on elisha and they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him look they said we your servants have fifty able men let them go and look for your master perhaps the spirit of the lord has picked him up and set him down on some mountain or in some valleyno elisha replied do not send them but they persisted until he was too ashamed to refuse so he said send them and they sent fifty men who searched for three days but did not find him when they returned to elisha who was staying in jericho he said to them didnt i tell you not to go the men of the city said to elisha look our lord this town is well situated as you can see but the water is bad and the land is unproductive bring me a new bowl he said and put salt in it so they brought it to him then he went out to the spring and threw the salt into it saying this is what the lord says i have healed this water never again will it cause death or make the land unproductive and the water has remained wholesome to this day according to the word elisha had spoken from there elisha went up to bethel as he was walking along the road some youths came out of the town and jeered at him go on up you baldhead they said go on up you baldhead he turned around looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the lord then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty two of the youths and he went on to mount carmel and from there returned to samaria joram son of ahab became king of israel in samaria in the eighteenth year of jehoshaphat king of judah and he reigned twelve years he did evil in the eyes of the lord but not as his father and mother had done he got rid of the sacred stone of baal that his father had made nevertheless he clung to the sins of jeroboam son of nebat which he had caused israel to commit he did not turn away from them now mesha king of moab raised sheep and he had to supply the king of israel with a hundred thousand lambs and with the wool of a hundred thousand rams but after ahab died the king of moab rebelled against the king of israel so at that time king joram set out from samaria and mobilized all israel he also sent this message to jehoshaphat king of judah the king of moab has rebelled against me will you go with me to fight against moabi will go with you he replied i am as you are my people as your people my horses as your horses by what route shall we attack he asked through the desert of edom he answered so the king of israel set out with the king of judah and the king of edom after a roundabout march of seven days the army had no more water for themselves or for the animals with them what exclaimed the king of israel has the lord called us three kings together only to hand us over to moab but jehoshaphat asked is there no prophet of the lord here that we may inquire of the lord through him an officer of the king of israel answered elisha son of shaphat is here he used to pour water on the hands of elijah jehoshaphat said the word of the lord is with him so the king of israel and jehoshaphat and the king of edom went down to him elisha said to the king of israel what do we have to do with each other go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your motherno the king of israel answered because it was the lord who called us three kings together to hand us over to moab elisha said as surely as the lord almighty lives whom i serve if i did not have respect for the presence of jehoshaphat king of judah i would not look at you or even notice you but now bring me a harpist while the harpist was playing the hand of the lord came upon elisha and he said this is what the lord says make this valley full of ditches for this is what the lord says you will see neither wind nor rain yet this valley will be filled with water and you your cattle and your other animals will drink this is an easy thing in the eyes of the lord he will also hand moab over to you you will overthrow every fortified city and every major town you will cut down every good tree stop up all the springs and ruin every good field with stones the next morning about the time for offering the sacrifice there it was water flowing from the direction of edom and the land was filled with water now all the moabites had heard that the kings had come to fight against them so every man young and old who could bear arms was called up and stationed on the border when they got up early in the morning the sun was shining on the water to the moabites across the way the water looked red like blood thats blood they said those kings must have fought and slaughtered each other now to the plunder moab but when the moabites came to the camp of israel the israelites rose up and fought them until they fled and the israelites invaded the land and slaughtered the moabites they destroyed the towns and each man threw a stone on every good field until it was covered they stopped up all the springs and cut down every good tree only kir hareseth was left with its stones in place but men armed with slings surrounded it and attacked it as well when the king of moab saw that the battle had gone against him he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through to the king of edom but they failed then he took his firstborn son who was to succeed him as king and offered him as a sacrifice on the city wall the fury against israel was great they withdrew and returned to their own land the wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to elisha your servant my husband is dead and you know that he revered the lord but now his creditor is coming to take my two boys as his slaves elisha replied to her how can i help you tell me what do you have in your houseyour servant has nothing there at all she said except a little oil elisha said go around and ask all your neighbors for empty jars dont ask for just a few then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons pour oil into all the jars and as each is filled put it to one side she left him and afterward shut the door behind her and her sons they brought the jars to her and she kept pouring when all the jars were full she said to her son bring me another one but he replied there is not a jar left then the oil stopped flowing she went and told the man of god and he said go sell the oil and pay your debts you and your sons can live on what is left one day elisha went to shunem and a well to do woman was there who urged him to stay for a meal so whenever he came by he stopped there to eat she said to her husband i know that this man who often comes our way is a holy man of god lets make a small room on the roof and put in it a bed and a table a chair and a lamp for him then he can stay there whenever he comes to us one day when elisha came he went up to his room and lay down there he said to his servant gehazi call the shunammite so he called her and she stood before him elisha said to him tell her you have gone to all this trouble for us now what can be done for you can we speak on your behalf to the king or the commander of the army she replied i have a home among my own people what can be done for her elisha asked gehazi said well she has no son and her husband is old then elisha said call her so he called her and she stood in the doorway about this time next year elisha said you will hold a son in your armsno my lord she objected dont mislead your servant o man of god but the woman became pregnant and the next year about that same time she gave birth to a son just as elisha had told her the child grew and one day he went out to his father who was with the reapers my head my head he said to his father his father told a servant carry him to his mother after the servant had lifted him up and carried him to his mother the boy sat on her lap until noon and then he died she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of god then shut the door and went out she called her husband and said please send me one of the servants and a donkey so i can go to the man of god quickly and return why go to him today he asked its not the new moon or the sabbathits all right she said she saddled the donkey and said to her servant lead on dont slow down for me unless i tell you so she set out and came to the man of god at mount carmel when he saw her in the distance the man of god said to his servant gehazi look theres the shunammite run to meet her and ask her are you all right is your husband all right is your child all right everything is all right she said when she reached the man of god at the mountain she took hold of his feet gehazi came over to push her away but the man of god said leave her alone she is in bitter distress but the lord has hidden it from me and has not told me why did i ask you for a son my lord she said didnt i tell you dont raise my hopes elisha said to gehazi tuck your cloak into your belt take my staff in your hand and run if you meet anyone do not greet him and if anyone greets you do not answer lay my staff on the boys face but the childs mother said as surely as the lord lives and as you live i will not leave you so he got up and followed her gehazi went on ahead and laid the staff on the boys face but there was no sound or response so gehazi went back to meet elisha and told him the boy has not awakened when elisha reached the house there was the boy lying dead on his couch he went in shut the door on the two of them and prayed to the lord then he got on the bed and lay upon the boy mouth to mouth eyes to eyes hands to hands as he stretched himself out upon him the boys body grew warm elisha turned away and walked back and forth in the room and then got on the bed and stretched out upon him once more the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes elisha summoned gehazi and said call the shunammite and he did when she came he said take your son she came in fell at his feet and bowed to the ground then she took her son and went out elisha returned to gilgal and there was a famine in that region while the company of the prophets was meeting with him he said to his servant put on the large pot and cook some stew for these men one of them went out into the fields to gather herbs and found a wild vine he gathered some of its gourds and filled the fold of his cloak when he returned he cut them up into the pot of stew though no one knew what they were the stew was poured out for the men but as they began to eat it they cried out o man of god there is death in the pot and they could not eat it elisha said get some flour he put it into the pot and said serve it to the people to eat and there was nothing harmful in the pot a man came from baal shalishah bringing the man of god twenty loaves of barley bread baked from the first ripe grain along with some heads of new grain give it to the people to eat elisha said how can i set this before a hundred men his servant asked but elisha answered give it to the people to eat for this is what the lord says they will eat and have some left over then he set it before them and they ate and had some left over according to the word of the lord now naaman was commander of the army of the king of aram he was a great man in the sight of his master and highly regarded because through him the lord had given victory to aram he was a valiant soldier but he had leprosy now bands from aram had gone out and had taken captive a young girl from israel and she served naamans wife she said to her mistress if only my master would see the prophet who is in samaria he would cure him of his leprosy naaman went to his master and told him what the girl from israel had said by all means go the king of aram replied i will send a letter to the king of israel so naaman left taking with him ten talents of silver six thousand shekels of gold and ten sets of clothing the letter that he took to the king of israel read with this letter i am sending my servant naaman to you so that you may cure him of his leprosy as soon as the king of israel read the letter he tore his robes and said am i god can i kill and bring back to life why does this fellow send someone to me to be cured of his leprosy see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me when elisha the man of god heard that the king of israel had torn his robes he sent him this message why have you torn your robes have the man come to me and he will know that there is a prophet in israel so naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the door of elishas house elisha sent a messenger to say to him go wash yourself seven times in the jordan and your flesh will be restored and you will be cleansed but naaman went away angry and said i thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call on the name of the lord his god wave his hand over the spot and cure me of my leprosy are not abana and pharpar the rivers of damascus better than any of the waters of israel couldnt i wash in them and be cleansed so he turned and went off in a rage naamans servants went to him and said my father if the prophet had told you to do some great thing would you not have done it how much more then when he tells you wash and be cleansed so he went down and dipped himself in the jordan seven times as the man of god had told him and his flesh was restored and became clean like that of a young boy then naaman and all his attendants went back to the man of god he stood before him and said now i know that there is no god in all the world except in israel please accept now a gift from your servant the prophet answered as surely as the lord lives whom i serve i will not accept a thing and even though naaman urged him he refused if you will not said naaman please let me your servant be given as much earth as a pair of mules can carry for your servant will never again make burnt offerings and sacrifices to any other god but the lord but may the lord forgive your servant for this one thing when my master enters the temple of rimmon to bow down and he is leaning on my arm and i bow there also when i bow down in the temple of rimmon may the lord forgive your servant for this go in peace elisha said after naaman had traveled some distance gehazi the servant of elisha the man of god said to himself my master was too easy on naaman this aramean by not accepting from him what he brought as surely as the lord lives i will run after him and get something from him so gehazi hurried after naaman when naaman saw him running toward him he got down from the chariot to meet him is everything all right he asked everything is all right gehazi answered my master sent me to say two young men from the company of the prophets have just come to me from the hill country of ephraim please give them a talent of silver and two sets of clothing by all means take two talents said naaman he urged gehazi to accept them and then tied up the two talents of silver in two bags with two sets of clothing he gave them to two of his servants and they carried them ahead of gehazi when gehazi came to the hill he took the things from the servants and put them away in the house he sent the men away and they left then he went in and stood before his master elisha where have you been gehazi elisha asked your servant didnt go anywhere gehazi answered but elisha said to him was not my spirit with you when the man got down from his chariot to meet you is this the time to take money or to accept clothes olive groves vineyards flocks herds or menservants and maidservants naamans leprosy will cling to you and to your descendants forever then gehazi went from elishas presence and he was leprous as white as snow the company of the prophets said to elisha look the place where we meet with you is too small for us let us go to the jordan where each of us can get a pole and let us build a place there for us to live and he said go then one of them said wont you please come with your servantsi will elisha replied and he went with them they went to the jordan and began to cut down trees as one of them was cutting down a tree the iron axhead fell into the water oh my lord he cried out it was borrowed the man of god asked where did it fall when he showed him the place elisha cut a stick and threw it there and made the iron float lift it out he said then the man reached out his hand and took it now the king of aram was at war with israel after conferring with his officers he said i will set up my camp in such and such a place the man of god sent word to the king of israel beware of passing that place because the arameans are going down there so the king of israel checked on the place indicated by the man of god time and again elisha warned the king so that he was on his guard in such places this enraged the king of aram he summoned his officers and demanded of them will you not tell me which of us is on the side of the king of israel none of us my lord the king said one of his officers but elisha the prophet who is in israel tells the king of israel the very words you speak in your bedroom go find out where he is the king ordered so i can send men and capture him the report came back he is in dothan then he sent horses and chariots and a strong force there they went by night and surrounded the city when the servant of the man of god got up and went out early the next morning an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city oh my lord what shall we do the servant asked dont be afraid the prophet answered those who are with us are more than those who are with them and elisha prayed o lord open his eyes so he may see then the lord opened the servants eyes and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around elisha as the enemy came down toward him elisha prayed to the lord strike these people with blindness so he struck them with blindness as elisha had asked elisha told them this is not the road and this is not the city follow me and i will lead you to the man you are looking for and he led them to samaria after they entered the city elisha said lord open the eyes of these men so they can see then the lord opened their eyes and they looked and there they were inside samaria when the king of israel saw them he asked elisha shall i kill them my father shall i kill them do not kill them he answered would you kill men you have captured with your own sword or bow set food and water before them so that they may eat and drink and then go back to their master so he prepared a great feast for them and after they had finished eating and drinking he sent them away and they returned to their master so the bands from aram stopped raiding israels territory some time later ben hadad king of aram mobilized his entire army and marched up and laid siege to samaria there was a great famine in the city the siege lasted so long that a donkeys head sold for eighty shekels of silver and a quarter of a cab of seed pods for five shekels as the king of israel was passing by on the wall a woman cried to him help me my lord the king the king replied if the lord does not help you where can i get help for you from the threshing floor from the winepress then he asked her whats the matter she answered this woman said to me give up your son so we may eat him today and tomorrow well eat my son so we cooked my son and ate him the next day i said to her give up your son so we may eat him but she had hidden him when the king heard the womans words he tore his robes as he went along the wall the people looked and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body he said may god deal with me be it ever so severely if the head of elisha son of shaphat remains on his shoulders today now elisha was sitting in his house and the elders were sitting with him the king sent a messenger ahead but before he arrived elisha said to the elders dont you see how this murderer is sending someone to cut off my head look when the messenger comes shut the door and hold it shut against him is not the sound of his masters footsteps behind him while he was still talking to them the messenger came down to him and the king said this disaster is from the lord why should i wait for the lord any longer elisha said hear the word of the lord this is what the lord says about this time tomorrow a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of samaria the officer on whose arm the king was leaning said to the man of god look even if the lord should open the floodgates of the heavens could this happenyou will see it with your own eyes answered elisha but you will not eat any of it now there were four men with leprosy at the entrance of the city gate they said to each other why stay here until we die if we say well go into the city the famine is there and we will die and if we stay here we will die so lets go over to the camp of the arameans and surrender if they spare us we live if they kill us then we die at dusk they got up and went to the camp of the arameans when they reached the edge of the camp not a man was there for the lord had caused the arameans to hear the sound of chariots and horses and a great army so that they said to one another look the king of israel has hired the hittite and egyptian kings to attack us so they got up and fled in the dusk and abandoned their tents and their horses and donkeys they left the camp as it was and ran for their lives the men who had leprosy reached the edge of the camp and entered one of the tents they ate and drank and carried away silver gold and clothes and went off and hid them they returned and entered another tent and took some things from it and hid them also then they said to each other were not doing right this is a day of good news and we are keeping it to ourselves if we wait until daylight punishment will overtake us lets go at once and report this to the royal palace so they went and called out to the city gatekeepers and told them we went into the aramean camp and not a man was there not a sound of anyone only tethered horses and donkeys and the tents left just as they were the gatekeepers shouted the news and it was reported within the palace the king got up in the night and said to his officers i will tell you what the arameans have done to us they know we are starving so they have left the camp to hide in the countryside thinking they will surely come out and then we will take them alive and get into the city one of his officers answered have some men take five of the horses that are left in the city their plight will be like that of all the israelites left here yes they will only be like all these israelites who are doomed so let us send them to find out what happened so they selected two chariots with their horses and the king sent them after the aramean army he commanded the drivers go and find out what has happened they followed them as far as the jordan and they found the whole road strewn with the clothing and equipment the arameans had thrown away in their headlong flight so the messengers returned and reported to the king then the people went out and plundered the camp of the arameans so a seah of flour sold for a shekel and two seahs of barley sold for a shekel as the lord had said now the king had put the officer on whose arm he leaned in charge of the gate and the people trampled him in the gateway and he died just as the man of god had foretold when the king came down to his house it happened as the man of god had said to the king about this time tomorrow a seah of flour will sell for a shekel and two seahs of barley for a shekel at the gate of samaria the officer had said to the man of god look even if the lord should open the floodgates of the heavens could this happen the man of god had replied you will see it with your own eyes but you will not eat any of it and that is exactly what happened to him for the people trampled him in the gateway and he died now elisha had said to the woman whose son he had restored to life go away with your family and stay for a while wherever you can because the lord has decreed a famine in the land that will last seven years the woman proceeded to do as the man of god said she and her family went away and stayed in the land of the philistines seven years at the end of the seven years she came back from the land of the philistines and went to the king to beg for her house and land the king was talking to gehazi the servant of the man of god and had said tell me about all the great things elisha has done just as gehazi was telling the king how elisha had restored the dead to life the woman whose son elisha had brought back to life came to beg the king for her house and land gehazi said this is the woman my lord the king and this is her son whom elisha restored to life the king asked the woman about it and she told him then he assigned an official to her case and said to him give back everything that belonged to her including all the income from her land from the day she left the country until now elisha went to damascus and ben hadad king of aram was ill when the king was told the man of god has come all the way up here he said to hazael take a gift with you and go to meet the man of god consult the lord through him ask him will i recover from this illness hazael went to meet elisha taking with him as a gift forty camel loads of all the finest wares of damascus he went in and stood before him and said your son ben hadad king of aram has sent me to ask will i recover from this illness elisha answered go and say to him you will certainly recover but the lord has revealed to me that he will in fact die he stared at him with a fixed gaze until hazael felt ashamed then the man of god began to weep why is my lord weeping asked hazael because i know the harm you will do to the israelites he answered you will set fire to their fortified places kill their young men with the sword dash their little children to the ground and rip open their pregnant women hazael said how could your servant a mere dog accomplish such a featthe lord has shown me that you will become king of aram answered elisha then hazael left elisha and returned to his master when ben hadad asked what did elisha say to you hazael replied he told me that you would certainly recover but the next day he took a thick cloth soaked it in water and spread it over the kings face so that he died then hazael succeeded him as king in the fifth year of joram son of ahab king of israel when jehoshaphat was king of judah jehoram son of jehoshaphat began his reign as king of judah he was thirty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eight years he walked in the ways of the kings of israel as the house of ahab had done for he married a daughter of ahab he did evil in the eyes of the lord nevertheless for the sake of his servant david the lord was not willing to destroy judah he had promised to maintain a lamp for david and his descendants forever in the time of jehoram edom rebelled against judah and set up its own king so jehoram went to zair with all his chariots the edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders but he rose up and broke through by night his army however fled back home to this day edom has been in rebellion against judah libnah revolted at the same time as for the other events of jehorams reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah jehoram rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of david and ahaziah his son succeeded him as king in the twelfth year of joram son of ahab king of israel ahaziah son of jehoram king of judah began to reign ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem one year his mothers name was athaliah a granddaughter of omri king of israel he walked in the ways of the house of ahab and did evil in the eyes of the lord as the house of ahab had done for he was related by marriage to ahabs family ahaziah went with joram son of ahab to war against hazael king of aram at ramoth gilead the arameans wounded joram so king joram returned to jezreel to recover from the wounds the arameans had inflicted on him at ramoth in his battle with hazael king of aram then ahaziah son of jehoram king of judah went down to jezreel to see joram son of ahab because he had been wounded the prophet elisha summoned a man from the company of the prophets and said to him tuck your cloak into your belt take this flask of oil with you and go to ramoth gilead when you get there look for jehu son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi go to him get him away from his companions and take him into an inner room then take the flask and pour the oil on his head and declare this is what the lord says i anoint you king over israel then open the door and run dont delay so the young man the prophet went to ramoth gilead when he arrived he found the army officers sitting together i have a message for you commander he said for which of us asked jehu for you commander he replied jehu got up and went into the house then the prophet poured the oil on jehus head and declared this is what the lord the god of israel says i anoint you king over the lords people israel you are to destroy the house of ahab your master and i will avenge the blood of my servants the prophets and the blood of all the lords servants shed by jezebel the whole house of ahab will perish i will cut off from ahab every last male in israel slave or free i will make the house of ahab like the house of jeroboam son of nebat and like the house of baasha son of ahijah as for jezebel dogs will devour her on the plot of ground at jezreel and no one will bury her then he opened the door and ran when jehu went out to his fellow officers one of them asked him is everything all right why did this madman come to youyou know the man and the sort of things he says jehu replied thats not true they said tell us jehu said here is what he told me this is what the lord says i anoint you king over israel they hurried and took their cloaks and spread them under him on the bare steps then they blew the trumpet and shouted jehu is king so jehu son of jehoshaphat the son of nimshi conspired against joram now joram and all israel had been defending ramoth gilead against hazael king of aram but king joram had returned to jezreel to recover from the wounds the arameans had inflicted on him in the battle with hazael king of aram jehu said if this is the way you feel dont let anyone slip out of the city to go and tell the news in jezreel then he got into his chariot and rode to jezreel because joram was resting there and ahaziah king of judah had gone down to see him when the lookout standing on the tower in jezreel saw jehus troops approaching he called out i see some troops comingget a horseman joram ordered send him to meet them and ask do you come in peace the horseman rode off to meet jehu and said this is what the king says do you come in peace what do you have to do with peace jehu replied fall in behind me the lookout reported the messenger has reached them but he isnt coming back so the king sent out a second horseman when he came to them he said this is what the king says do you come in peace jehu replied what do you have to do with peace fall in behind me the lookout reported he has reached them but he isnt coming back either the driving is like that of jehu son of nimshi he drives like a madman hitch up my chariot joram ordered and when it was hitched up joram king of israel and ahaziah king of judah rode out each in his own chariot to meet jehu they met him at the plot of ground that had belonged to naboth the jezreelite when joram saw jehu he asked have you come in peace jehuhow can there be peace jehu replied as long as all the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother jezebel abound joram turned about and fled calling out to ahaziah treachery ahaziah then jehu drew his bow and shot joram between the shoulders the arrow pierced his heart and he slumped down in his chariot jehu said to bidkar his chariot officer pick him up and throw him on the field that belonged to naboth the jezreelite remember how you and i were riding together in chariots behind ahab his father when the lord made this prophecy about him yesterday i saw the blood of naboth and the blood of his sons declares the lord and i will surely make you pay for it on this plot of ground declares the lord now then pick him up and throw him on that plot in accordance with the word of the lord when ahaziah king of judah saw what had happened he fled up the road to beth haggan jehu chased him shouting kill him too they wounded him in his chariot on the way up to gur near ibleam but he escaped to megiddo and died there his servants took him by chariot to jerusalem and buried him with his fathers in his tomb in the city of david in the eleventh year of joram son of ahab ahaziah had become king of judah then jehu went to jezreel when jezebel heard about it she painted her eyes arranged her hair and looked out of a window as jehu entered the gate she asked have you come in peace zimri you murderer of your master he looked up at the window and called out who is on my side who two or three eunuchs looked down at him throw her down jehu said so they threw her down and some of her blood spattered the wall and the horses as they trampled her underfoot jehu went in and ate and drank take care of that cursed woman he said and bury her for she was a kings daughter but when they went out to bury her they found nothing except her skull her feet and her hands they went back and told jehu who said this is the word of the lord that he spoke through his servant elijah the tishbite on the plot of ground at jezreel dogs will devour jezebels flesh jezebels body will be like refuse on the ground in the plot at jezreel so that no one will be able to say this is jezebel now there were in samaria seventy sons of the house of ahab so jehu wrote letters and sent them to samaria to the officials of jezreel to the elders and to the guardians of ahabs children he said as soon as this letter reaches you since your masters sons are with you and you have chariots and horses a fortified city and weapons choose the best and most worthy of your masters sons and set him on his fathers throne then fight for your masters house but they were terrified and said if two kings could not resist him how can we so the palace administrator the city governor the elders and the guardians sent this message to jehu we are your servants and we will do anything you say we will not appoint anyone as king you do whatever you think best then jehu wrote them a second letter saying if you are on my side and will obey me take the heads of your masters sons and come to me in jezreel by this time tomorrow now the royal princes seventy of them were with the leading men of the city who were rearing them when the letter arrived these men took the princes and slaughtered all seventy of them they put their heads in baskets and sent them to jehu in jezreel when the messenger arrived he told jehu they have brought the heads of the princes then jehu ordered put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning the next morning jehu went out he stood before all the people and said you are innocent it was i who conspired against my master and killed him but who killed all these know then that not a word the lord has spoken against the house of ahab will fail the lord has done what he promised through his servant elijah so jehu killed everyone in jezreel who remained of the house of ahab as well as all his chief men his close friends and his priests leaving him no survivor jehu then set out and went toward samaria at beth eked of the shepherds he met some relatives of ahaziah king of judah and asked who are you they said we are relatives of ahaziah and we have come down to greet the families of the king and of the queen mother take them alive he ordered so they took them alive and slaughtered them by the well of beth eked forty two men he left no survivor after he left there he came upon jehonadab son of recab who was on his way to meet him jehu greeted him and said are you in accord with me as i am with youi am jehonadab answered if so said jehu give me your hand so he did and jehu helped him up into the chariot jehu said come with me and see my zeal for the lord then he had him ride along in his chariot when jehu came to samaria he killed all who were left there of ahabs family he destroyed them according to the word of the lord spoken to elijah then jehu brought all the people together and said to them ahab served baal a little jehu will serve him much now summon all the prophets of baal all his ministers and all his priests see that no one is missing because i am going to hold a great sacrifice for baal anyone who fails to come will no longer live but jehu was acting deceptively in order to destroy the ministers of baal jehu said call an assembly in honor of baal so they proclaimed it then he sent word throughout israel and all the ministers of baal came not one stayed away they crowded into the temple of baal until it was full from one end to the other and jehu said to the keeper of the wardrobe bring robes for all the ministers of baal so he brought out robes for them then jehu and jehonadab son of recab went into the temple of baal jehu said to the ministers of baal look around and see that no servants of the lord are here with you only ministers of baal so they went in to make sacrifices and burnt offerings now jehu had posted eighty men outside with this warning if one of you lets any of the men i am placing in your hands escape it will be your life for his life as soon as jehu had finished making the burnt offering he ordered the guards and officers go in and kill them let no one escape so they cut them down with the sword the guards and officers threw the bodies out and then entered the inner shrine of the temple of baal they brought the sacred stone out of the temple of baal and burned it they demolished the sacred stone of baal and tore down the temple of baal and people have used it for a latrine to this day so jehu destroyed baal worship in israel however he did not turn away from the sins of jeroboam son of nebat which he had caused israel to commit the worship of the golden calves at bethel and dan the lord said to jehu because you have done well in accomplishing what is right in my eyes and have done to the house of ahab all i had in mind to do your descendants will sit on the throne of israel to the fourth generation yet jehu was not careful to keep the law of the lord the god of israel with all his heart he did not turn away from the sins of jeroboam which he had caused israel to commit in those days the lord began to reduce the size of israel hazael overpowered the israelites throughout their territory east of the jordan in all the land of gilead the region of gad reuben and manasseh from aroer by the arnon gorge through gilead to bashan as for the other events of jehus reign all he did and all his achievements are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel jehu rested with his fathers and was buried in samaria and jehoahaz his son succeeded him as king the time that jehu reigned over israel in samaria was twenty eight years when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family but jehosheba the daughter of king jehoram and sister of ahaziah took joash son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered she put him and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from athaliah so he was not killed he remained hidden with his nurse at the temple of the lord for six years while athaliah ruled the land in the seventh year jehoiada sent for the commanders of units of a hundred the carites and the guards and had them brought to him at the temple of the lord he made a covenant with them and put them under oath at the temple of the lord then he showed them the kings son he commanded them saying this is what you are to do you who are in the three companies that are going on duty on the sabbath a third of you guarding the royal palace a third at the sur gate and a third at the gate behind the guard who take turns guarding the temple and you who are in the other two companies that normally go off sabbath duty are all to guard the temple for the king station yourselves around the king each man with his weapon in his hand anyone who approaches your ranks must be put to death stay close to the king wherever he goes the commanders of units of a hundred did just as jehoiada the priest ordered each one took his men those who were going on duty on the sabbath and those who were going off duty and came to jehoiada the priest then he gave the commanders the spears and shields that had belonged to king david and that were in the temple of the lord the guards each with his weapon in his hand stationed themselves around the king near the altar and the temple from the south side to the north side of the temple jehoiada brought out the kings son and put the crown on him he presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king they anointed him and the people clapped their hands and shouted long live the king when athaliah heard the noise made by the guards and the people she went to the people at the temple of the lord she looked and there was the king standing by the pillar as the custom was the officers and the trumpeters were beside the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets then athaliah tore her robes and called out treason treason jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders of units of a hundred who were in charge of the troops bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her for the priest had said she must not be put to death in the temple of the lord so they seized her as she reached the place where the horses enter the palace grounds and there she was put to death jehoiada then made a covenant between the lord and the king and people that they would be the lords people he also made a covenant between the king and the people all the people of the land went to the temple of baal and tore it down they smashed the altars and idols to pieces and killed mattan the priest of baal in front of the altars then jehoiada the priest posted guards at the temple of the lord he took with him the commanders of hundreds the carites the guards and all the people of the land and together they brought the king down from the temple of the lord and went into the palace entering by way of the gate of the guards the king then took his place on the royal throne and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet because athaliah had been slain with the sword at the palace joash was seven years old when he began to reign in the seventh year of jehu joash became king and he reigned in jerusalem forty years his mothers name was zibiah she was from beersheba joash did what was right in the eyes of the lord all the years jehoiada the priest instructed him the high places however were not removed the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there joash said to the priests collect all the money that is brought as sacred offerings to the temple of the lord the money collected in the census the money received from personal vows and the money brought voluntarily to the temple let every priest receive the money from one of the treasurers and let it be used to repair whatever damage is found in the temple but by the twenty third year of king joash the priests still had not repaired the temple therefore king joash summoned jehoiada the priest and the other priests and asked them why arent you repairing the damage done to the temple take no more money from your treasurers but hand it over for repairing the temple the priests agreed that they would not collect any more money from the people and that they would not repair the temple themselves jehoiada the priest took a chest and bored a hole in its lid he placed it beside the altar on the right side as one enters the temple of the lord the priests who guarded the entrance put into the chest all the money that was brought to the temple of the lord whenever they saw that there was a large amount of money in the chest the royal secretary and the high priest came counted the money that had been brought into the temple of the lord and put it into bags when the amount had been determined they gave the money to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple with it they paid those who worked on the temple of the lord the carpenters and builders the masons and stonecutters they purchased timber and dressed stone for the repair of the temple of the lord and met all the other expenses of restoring the temple the money brought into the temple was not spent for making silver basins wick trimmers sprinkling bowls trumpets or any other articles of gold or silver for the temple of the lord it was paid to the workmen who used it to repair the temple they did not require an accounting from those to whom they gave the money to pay the workers because they acted with complete honesty the money from the guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the temple of the lord it belonged to the priests about this time hazael king of aram went up and attacked gath and captured it then he turned to attack jerusalem but joash king of judah took all the sacred objects dedicated by his fathers jehoshaphat jehoram and ahaziah the kings of judah and the gifts he himself had dedicated and all the gold found in the treasuries of the temple of the lord and of the royal palace and he sent them to hazael king of aram who then withdrew from jerusalem as for the other events of the reign of joash and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah his officials conspired against him and assassinated him at beth millo on the road down to silla the officials who murdered him were jozabad son of shimeath and jehozabad son of shomer he died and was buried with his fathers in the city of david and amaziah his son succeeded him as king in the twenty third year of joash son of ahaziah king of judah jehoahaz son of jehu became king of israel in samaria and he reigned seventeen years he did evil in the eyes of the lord by following the sins of jeroboam son of nebat which he had caused israel to commit and he did not turn away from them so the lords anger burned against israel and for a long time he kept them under the power of hazael king of aram and ben hadad his son then jehoahaz sought the lords favor and the lord listened to him for he saw how severely the king of aram was oppressing israel the lord provided a deliverer for israel and they escaped from the power of aram so the israelites lived in their own homes as they had before but they did not turn away from the sins of the house of jeroboam which he had caused israel to commit they continued in them also the asherah pole remained standing in samaria nothing had been left of the army of jehoahaz except fifty horsemen ten chariots and ten thousand foot soldiers for the king of aram had destroyed the rest and made them like the dust at threshing time as for the other events of the reign of jehoahaz all he did and his achievements are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of israel jehoahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in samaria and jehoash his son succeeded him as king in the thirty seventh year of joash king of judah jehoash son of jehoahaz became king of israel in samaria and he reigned sixteen

and wept over him my father my father he cried the chariots and horsemen of israel elisha said get a bow and some arrows and he did so take the bow in your hands he said to the king of israel when he had taken it elisha put his hands on the kings hands open the east window he said and he opened it shoot elisha said and he shot the lords arrow of victory the arrow of victory over aram elisha declared you will completely destroy the arameans at aphek then he said take the arrows and the king took them elisha told him strike the ground he struck it three times and stopped the man of god was angry with him and said you should have struck the ground five or six times then you would have defeated aram and completely destroyed it but now you will defeat it only three times elisha died and was buried now moabite raiders used to enter the country every spring once while some israelites were burying a man suddenly they saw a band of raiders so they threw the mans body into elishas tomb when the body touched elishas bones the man came to life and stood up on his feet hazael king of aram oppressed israel throughout the reign of jehoahaz but the lord was gracious to them and had compassion and showed concern for them because of his covenant with abraham isaac and jacob to this day he has been unwilling to destroy them or banish them from his presence hazael king of aram died and ben hadad his son succeeded him as king then jehoash son of jehoahaz recaptured from ben hadad son of hazael the towns he had taken in battle from his father jehoahaz three times jehoash defeated him and so he recovered the israelite towns in the second year of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel amaziah son of joash king of judah began to reign he was twenty five years old when he became

everything he followed the example of his father joash the high places however were not removed the people continued to offer sacrifices and burn incense there after the kingdom was firmly in his grasp he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king yet he did not put the sons of the assassins to death in accordance with what is written in the book of the law of moses where the lord commanded fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their fathers each is to die for his own sins he was the one who defeated ten thousand edomites in the valley of salt and captured sela in battle calling it joktheel the name it has to this day then amaziah sent messengers to jehoash son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel with the challenge come meet me face to face but jehoash king of israel replied to amaziah king of judah a thistle in lebanon sent a message to a cedar in lebanon give your daughter to my son in marriage then a wild beast in lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot you have indeed defeated edom and now you are arrogant glory in your victory but stay at home why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of judah also amaziah however would not listen so jehoash king of israel attacked he and amaziah king of judah faced each other at beth shemesh in judah judah was routed by israel and every man fled to his home jehoash king of israel captured amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of ahaziah at beth shemesh then jehoash went to jerusalem and broke down the wall of

he did evil in the eyes of the lord and did not turn away from any of the sins of jeroboam son of nebat which he had caused israel to commit he was the one who restored the boundaries of israel from

the king of assyria invaded the entire land marched against samaria and laid siege to it for three years in the ninth year of hoshea the king of assyria captured samaria and deported the israelites to assyria he settled them in halah in gozan on the habor river and in the towns of the medes all this took place because the israelites had sinned against the lord their god who had brought them up out of egypt from under the power of pharaoh king of egypt they worshiped other gods and followed the practices of the nations the lord had driven out before them as well as the practices that the kings of israel had introduced the israelites secretly did things against the lord their god that were not right from watchtower to fortified city they built themselves high places in all their towns they set up sacred stones and asherah poles on every high hill and under every spreading tree at every high place they burned incense as the nations whom the lord had driven out before them had done they did wicked things that provoked the lord to anger they worshiped idols though the lord had said you shall not do this the lord warned israel and judah through all his prophets and seers turn from your evil ways observe my commands and decrees in accordance with the entire law that i commanded your fathers to obey and that i delivered to you through my servants the prophets but they would not listen and were as stiff necked as their fathers who did not trust in the lord their god they rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their fathers and the warnings he had given them they followed worthless idols and themselves became worthless they imitated the nations around them although the lord had ordered them do not do as they do and they did the things the lord had forbidden them to do they forsook all the commands of the lord their god and made for themselves two idols cast in the shape of calves and an asherah pole they bowed down to all the starry hosts and they worshiped baal they sacrificed their sons and daughters in the fire they practiced divination and sorcery and sold themselves to do evil in the eyes of the lord provoking him to anger so the lord was very angry with israel and removed them from his presence only the tribe of judah was left and even judah did not keep the commands of the lord their god they followed the practices israel had introduced therefore the lord rejected all the people of israel he afflicted them and gave them into the hands of plunderers until he thrust them from his presence when he tore israel away from the house of david they made jeroboam son of nebat their king jeroboam enticed israel away from following the lord and caused them to commit a great sin the israelites persisted in all the sins of jeroboam and did not turn away from them until the lord removed them from his presence as he had warned through all his servants the prophets so the people of israel were taken from their homeland into exile in assyria and they are still there the king of assyria brought people from babylon cuthah avva hamath and sepharvaim and settled them in the towns of samaria to replace the israelites they took over samaria and lived in its towns when they first lived there they did not worship the lord so he sent lions among them and they killed some of the people it was reported to the king of assyria the people you deported and resettled in the towns of samaria do not know what the god of that country requires he has sent lions among them which are killing them off because the people do not know what he requires then the king of assyria gave this order have one of the priests you took captive from samaria go back to live there and teach the people what the god of the land requires so one of the priests who had been exiled from samaria came to live in bethel and taught them how to worship the lord nevertheless each national group made its own gods in the several towns where they settled and set them up in the shrines the people of samaria had made at the high places the men from babylon made succoth benoth the men from cuthah made nergal and the men from hamath made ashima the avvites made nibhaz and tartak and the sepharvites burned their children in the fire as sacrifices to adrammelech and anammelech the gods of sepharvaim they worshiped the lord but they also appointed all sorts of their own people to officiate for them as priests in the shrines at the high places they worshiped the lord but they also served their own gods in accordance with the customs of the nations from which they had been brought to this day they persist in their former practices they neither worship the lord nor adhere to the decrees and ordinances the laws and commands that the lord gave the descendants of jacob whom he named israel when the lord made a covenant with the israelites he commanded them do not worship any other gods or bow down to them serve them or sacrifice to them but the lord who brought you up out of egypt with mighty power and outstretched arm is the one you must worship to him you shall bow down and to him offer sacrifices you must always be careful to keep the decrees and ordinances the laws and commands he wrote for you do not worship other gods do not forget the covenant i have made with you and do not worship other gods rather worship the lord your god it is he who will deliver you from the hand of all your enemies they would not listen however but persisted in their former practices even while these people were worshiping the lord they were serving their idols to this day their children and grandchildren continue to do as their fathers did in the third year of hoshea son of elah king of israel hezekiah son of ahaz king of judah began to reign he was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem twenty nine years his mothers name was abijah daughter of zechariah he did what was right in the eyes of the lord just as his father david had done he removed the high places smashed the sacred stones and cut down the asherah poles he broke into pieces the bronze snake moses had made for up to that time the israelites had been burning incense to it it was called nehushtan  hezekiah trusted in the lord the god of israel there was no one like him among all the kings of judah either before him or after him he held fast to the lord and did not cease to follow him he kept the commands the lord had given moses and the lord was with him he was successful in whatever he undertook he rebelled against the king of assyria and did not serve him from watchtower to fortified city he defeated the philistines as far as gaza and its territory in king hezekiahs fourth year which was the seventh year of hoshea son of elah king of israel shalmaneser king of assyria marched against samaria and laid siege to it at the end of three years the assyrians took it so samaria was captured in hezekiahs sixth year which was the ninth year of hoshea king of israel the king of assyria deported israel to assyria and settled them in halah in gozan on the habor river and in towns of the medes this happened because they had not obeyed the lord their god but had violated his covenant all that moses the servant of the lord commanded they neither listened to the commands nor carried them out in the fourteenth year of king hezekiahs reign sennacherib king of assyria attacked all the fortified cities of judah and captured them so hezekiah king of judah sent this message to the king of assyria at lachish i have done wrong withdraw from me and i will pay whatever you demand of me the king of assyria exacted from hezekiah king of judah three hundred talents of silver and thirty talents of gold so hezekiah gave him all the silver that was found in the temple of the lord and in the treasuries of the royal palace at this time hezekiah king of judah stripped off the gold with which he had covered the doors and doorposts of the temple of the lord and gave it to the king of assyria the king of assyria sent his supreme commander his chief officer and his field commander with a large army from lachish to king hezekiah at jerusalem they came up to jerusalem and stopped at the aqueduct of the upper pool on the road to the washermans field they called for the king and eliakim son of hilkiah the palace administrator shebna the secretary and joah son of asaph the recorder went out to them the field commander said to them tell hezekiah this is what the great king the king of assyria says on what are you basing this confidence of yours you say you have strategy and military strength but you speak only empty words on whom are you depending that you rebel against me look now you are depending on egypt that splintered reed of a staff which pierces a mans hand and wounds him if he leans on it such is pharaoh king of egypt to all who depend on him and if you say to me we are depending on the lord our god isnt he the one whose high places and altars hezekiah removed saying to judah and jerusalem you must worship before this altar in jerusalem come now make a bargain with my master the king of assyria i will give you two thousand horses if you can put riders on them how can you repulse one officer of the least of my masters officials even though you are depending on egypt for chariots and horsemen furthermore have i come to attack and destroy this place without word from the lord the lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it then eliakim son of hilkiah and shebna and joah said to the field commander please speak to your servants in aramaic since we understand it dont speak to us in hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall but the commander replied was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things and not to the men sitting on the wall who like you will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine then the commander stood and called out in hebrew hear the word of the great king the king of assyria this is what the king says do not let hezekiah deceive you he cannot deliver you from my hand do not let hezekiah persuade you to trust in the lord when he says the lord will surely deliver us this city will not be given into the hand of the king of assyria do not listen to hezekiah this is what the king of assyria says make peace with me and come out to me then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern until i come and take you to a land like your own a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards a land of olive trees and honey choose life and not death do not listen to hezekiah for he is misleading you when he says the lord will deliver us has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim hena and ivvah have they rescued samaria from my hand who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me how then can the lord deliver jerusalem from my hand but the people remained silent and said nothing in reply because the king had commanded do not answer him then eliakim son of hilkiah the palace administrator shebna the secretary and joah son of asaph the recorder went to hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the field commander had said when king hezekiah heard this he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the lord he sent eliakim the palace administrator shebna the secretary and the leading priests all wearing sackcloth to the prophet isaiah son of amoz they told him this is what hezekiah says this day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them it may be that the lord your god will hear all the words of the field commander whom his master the king of assyria has sent to ridicule the living god and that he will rebuke him for the words the lord your god has heard therefore pray for the remnant that still survives when king hezekiahs officials came to isaiah isaiah said to them tell your master this is what the lord says do not be afraid of what you have heard those words with which the underlings of the king of assyria have blasphemed me listen i am going to put such a spirit in him that when he hears a certain report he will return to his own country and there i will have him cut down with the sword when the field commander heard that the king of assyria had left lachish he withdrew and found the king fighting against libnah now sennacherib received a report that tirhakah the cushite king of egypt was marching out to fight against him so he again sent messengers to hezekiah with this word say to hezekiah king of judah do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of assyria surely you have heard what the kings of assyria have done to all the countries destroying them completely and will you be delivered did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them the gods of gozan haran rezeph and the people of eden who were in tel assar where is the king of hamath the king of arpad the king of the city of sepharvaim or of hena or ivvah hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it then he went up to the temple of the lord and spread it out before the lord and hezekiah prayed to the lord o lord god of israel enthroned between the cherubim you alone are god over all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth give ear o lord and hear open your eyes o lord and see listen to the words sennacherib has sent to insult the living god it is true o lord that the assyrian kings have laid waste these nations and their lands they have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them for they were not gods but only wood and stone fashioned by mens hands now o lord our god deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone o lord are god then isaiah son of amoz sent a message to hezekiah this is what the lord the god of israel says i have heard your prayer concerning sennacherib king of assyria this is the word that the lord has spoken against him the virgin daughter of zion despises you and mocks you the daughter of jerusalem tosses her head as you flee who is it you have insulted and blasphemed against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride against the holy one of israel by your messengers you have heaped insults on the lord and you have said with my many chariots i have ascended the heights of the mountains the utmost heights of lebanon i have cut down its tallest cedars the choicest of its pines i have reached its remotest parts the finest of its forests i have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there with the soles of my feet i have dried up all the streams of egypt have you not heard long ago i ordained it in days of old i planned it now i have brought it to pass that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone their people drained of power are dismayed and put to shame they are like plants in the field like tender green shoots like grass sprouting on the roof scorched before it grows up but i know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me because you rage against me and your insolence has reached my ears i will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth and i will make you return by the way you came this will be the sign for you o hezekiah this year you will eat what grows by itself and the second year what springs from that but in the third year sow and reap plant vineyards and eat their fruit once more a remnant of the house of judah will take root below and bear fruit above for out of jerusalem will come a remnant and out of mount zion a band of survivors the zeal of the lord almighty will accomplish this therefore this is what the lord says concerning the king of assyria he will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here he will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it by the way that he came he will return he will not enter this city declares the lord i will defend this city and save it for my sake and for the sake of david my servant that night the angel of the lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty five thousand men in the assyrian camp when the people got up the next morning there were all the dead bodies so sennacherib king of assyria broke camp and withdrew he returned to nineveh and stayed there one day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god nisroch his sons adrammelech and sharezer cut him down with the sword and they escaped to the land of ararat and esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king in those days hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death the prophet isaiah son of amoz went to him and said this is what the lord says put your house in order because you are going to die you will not recover hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the lord remember o lord how i have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes and hezekiah wept bitterly before isaiah had left the middle court the word of the lord came to him go back and tell hezekiah the leader of my people this is what the lord the god of your father david says i have heard your prayer and seen your tears i will heal you on the third day from now you will go up to the temple of the lord i will add fifteen years to your life and i will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of assyria i will defend this city for my sake and for the sake of my servant david then isaiah said prepare a poultice of figs they did so and applied it to the boil and he recovered hezekiah had asked isaiah what will be the sign that the lord will heal me and that i will go up to the temple of the lord on the third day from now isaiah answered this is the lords sign to you that the lord will do what he has promised shall the shadow go forward ten steps or shall it go back ten steps it is a simple matter for the shadow to go forward ten steps said hezekiah rather have it go back ten steps then the prophet isaiah called upon the lord and the lord made the shadow go back the ten steps it had gone down on the stairway of ahaz at that time merodach baladan son of baladan king of babylon sent hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of hezekiahs illness hezekiah received the messengers and showed them all that was in his storehouses the silver the gold the spices and the fine oil his armory and everything found among his treasures there was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that hezekiah did not show them then isaiah the prophet went to king hezekiah and asked what did those men say and where did they come fromfrom a distant land hezekiah replied they came from babylon the prophet asked what did they see in your palacethey saw everything in my palace hezekiah said there is nothing among my treasures that i did not show them then isaiah said to hezekiah hear the word of the lord the time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to babylon nothing will be left says the lord and some of your descendants your own flesh and blood that will be born to you will be taken away and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon the word of the lord you have spoken is good hezekiah replied for he thought will there not be peace and security in my lifetime as for the other events of hezekiahs reign all his achievements and how he made the pool and the tunnel by which he brought water into the city are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah hezekiah rested with his fathers and manasseh his son succeeded him as king manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem fifty five years his mothers name was hephzibah he did evil in the eyes of the lord following the detestable practices of the nations the lord had driven out before the israelites he rebuilt the high places his father hezekiah had destroyed he also erected altars to baal and made an asherah pole as ahab king of israel had done he bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them he built altars in the temple of the lord of which the lord had said in jerusalem i will put my name in both courts of the temple of the lord he built altars to all the starry hosts he sacrificed his own son in the fire practiced sorcery and divination and consulted mediums and spiritists he did much evil in the eyes of the lord provoking him to anger he took the carved asherah pole he had made and put it in the temple of which the lord had said to david and to his son solomon in this temple and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel i will put my name forever i will not again make the feet of the israelites wander from the land i gave their forefathers if only they will be careful to do everything i commanded them and will keep the whole law that my servant moses gave them but the people did not listen manasseh led them astray so that they did more evil than the nations the lord had destroyed before the israelites the lord said through his servants the prophets manasseh king of judah has committed these detestable sins he has done more evil than the amorites who preceded him and has led judah into sin with his idols therefore this is what the lord the god of israel says i am going to bring such disaster on jerusalem and judah that the ears of everyone who hears of it will tingle i will stretch out over jerusalem the measuring line used against samaria and the plumb line used against the house of ahab i will wipe out jerusalem as one wipes a dish wiping it and turning it upside down i will forsake the remnant of my inheritance and hand them over to their enemies they will be looted and plundered by all their foes because they have done evil in my eyes and have provoked me to anger from the day their forefathers came out of egypt until this day moreover manasseh also shed so much innocent blood that he filled jerusalem from end to end besides the sin that he had caused judah to commit so that they did evil in the eyes of the lord as for the other events of manassehs reign and all he did including the sin he committed are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace garden the garden of uzza and amon his son succeeded him as king amon was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem two years his mothers name was meshullemeth daughter of haruz she was from jotbah he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his father manasseh had done he walked in all the ways of his father he worshiped the idols his father had worshiped and bowed down to them he forsook the lord the god of his fathers and did not walk in the way of the lord amons officials conspired against him and assassinated the king in his palace then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against king amon and they made josiah his son king in his place as for the other events of amons reign and what he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah he was buried in his grave in the garden of uzza and josiah his son succeeded him as king josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem thirty one years his mothers name was jedidah daughter of adaiah she was from bozkath he did what was right in the eyes of the lord and walked in all the ways of his father david not turning aside to the right or to the left in the eighteenth year of his reign king josiah sent the secretary shaphan son of azaliah the son of meshullam to the temple of the lord he said go up to hilkiah the high priest and have him get ready the money that has been brought into the temple of the lord which the doorkeepers have collected from the people have them entrust it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the temple and have these men pay the workers who repair the temple of the lord the carpenters the builders and the masons also have them purchase timber and dressed stone to repair the temple but they need not account for the money entrusted to them because they are acting faithfully hilkiah the high priest said to shaphan the secretary i have found the book of the law in the temple of the lord he gave it to shaphan who read it then shaphan the secretary went to the king and reported to him your officials have paid out the money that was in the temple of the lord and have entrusted it to the workers and supervisors at the temple then shaphan the secretary informed the king hilkiah the priest has given me a book and shaphan read from it in the presence of the king when the king heard the words of the book of the law he tore his robes he gave these orders to hilkiah the priest ahikam son of shaphan acbor son of micaiah shaphan the secretary and asaiah the kings attendant go and inquire of the lord for me and for the people and for all judah about what is written in this book that has been found great is the lords anger that burns against us because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book they have not acted in accordance with all that is written there concerning us hilkiah the priest ahikam acbor shaphan and asaiah went to speak to the prophetess huldah who was the wife of shallum son of tikvah the son of harhas keeper of the wardrobe she lived in jerusalem in the second district she said to them this is what the lord the god of israel says tell the man who sent you to me this is what the lord says i am going to bring disaster on this place and its people according to everything written in the book the king of judah has read because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all the idols their hands have made my anger will burn against this place and will not be quenched tell the king of judah who sent you to inquire of the lord this is what the lord the god of israel says concerning the words you heard because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the lord when you heard what i have spoken against this place and its people that they would become accursed and laid waste and because you tore your robes and wept in my presence i have heard you declares the lord therefore i will gather you to your fathers and you will be buried in peace your eyes will not see all the disaster i am going to bring on this place so they took her answer back to the king then the king called together all the elders of judah and jerusalem he went up to the temple of the lord with the men of judah the people of jerusalem the priests and the prophets all the people from the least to the greatest he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the temple of the lord the king stood by the pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the lord to follow the lord and keep his commands regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul thus confirming the words of the covenant written in this book then all the people pledged themselves to the covenant the king ordered hilkiah the high priest the priests next in rank and the doorkeepers to remove from the temple of the lord all the articles made for baal and asherah and all the starry hosts he burned them outside jerusalem in the fields of the kidron valley and took the ashes to bethel he did away with the pagan priests appointed by the kings of judah to burn incense on the high places of the towns of judah and on those around jerusalem those who burned incense to baal to the sun and moon to the constellations and to all the starry hosts he took the asherah pole from the temple of the lord to the kidron valley outside jerusalem and burned it there he ground it to powder and scattered the dust over the graves of the common people he also tore down the quarters of the male shrine prostitutes which were in the temple of the lord and where women did weaving for asherah josiah brought all the priests from the towns of judah and desecrated the high places from geba to beersheba where the priests had burned incense he broke down the shrines at the gates at the entrance to the gate of joshua the city governor which is on the left of the city gate although the priests of the high places did not serve at the altar of the lord in jerusalem they ate unleavened bread with their fellow priests he desecrated topheth which was in the valley of ben hinnom so no one could use it to sacrifice his son or daughter in the fire to molech he removed from the entrance to the temple of the lord the horses that the kings of judah had dedicated to the sun they were in the court near the room of an official named nathan melech josiah then burned the chariots dedicated to the sun he pulled down the altars the kings of judah had erected on the roof near the upper room of ahaz and the altars manasseh had built in the two courts of the temple of the lord he removed them from there smashed them to pieces and threw the rubble into the kidron valley the king also desecrated the high places that were east of jerusalem on the south of the hill of corruption the ones solomon king of israel had built for ashtoreth the vile goddess of the sidonians for chemosh the vile god of moab and for molech the detestable god of the people of ammon josiah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the asherah poles and covered the sites with human bones even the altar at bethel the high place made by jeroboam son of nebat who had caused israel to sin even that altar and high place he demolished he burned the high place and ground it to powder and burned the asherah pole also then josiah looked around and when he saw the tombs that were there on the hillside he had the bones removed from them and burned on the altar to defile it in accordance with the word of the lord proclaimed by the man of god who foretold these things the king asked what is that tombstone i see the men of the city said it marks the tomb of the man of god who came from judah and pronounced against the altar of bethel the very things you have done to it leave it alone he said dont let anyone disturb his bones so they spared his bones and those of the prophet who had come from samaria just as he had done at bethel josiah removed and defiled all the shrines at the high places that the kings of israel had built in the towns of samaria that had provoked the lord to anger josiah slaughtered all the priests of those high places on the altars and burned human bones on them then he went back to jerusalem the king gave this order to all the people celebrate the passover to the lord your god as it is written in this book of the covenant not since the days of the judges who led israel nor throughout the days of the kings of israel and the kings of judah had any such passover been observed but in the eighteenth year of king josiah this passover was celebrated to the lord in jerusalem furthermore josiah got rid of the mediums and spiritists the household gods the idols and all the other detestable things seen in judah and jerusalem this he did to fulfill the requirements of the law written in the book that hilkiah the priest had discovered in the temple of the lord neither before nor after josiah was there a king like him who turned to the lord as he did with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength in accordance with all the law of moses nevertheless the lord did not turn away from the heat of his fierce anger which burned against judah because of all that manasseh had done to provoke him to anger so the lord said i will remove judah also from my presence as i removed israel and i will reject jerusalem the city i chose and this temple about which i said there shall my name be as for the other events of josiahs reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah while josiah was king pharaoh neco king of egypt went up to the euphrates river to help the king of assyria king josiah marched out to meet him in battle but neco faced him and killed him at megiddo josiahs servants brought his body in a chariot from megiddo to jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb and the people of the land took jehoahaz son of josiah and anointed him and made him king in place of his father jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem three months his mothers name was hamutal daughter of jeremiah she was from libnah he did evil in the eyes of the lord just as his fathers had done pharaoh neco put him in chains at riblah in the land of hamath so that he might not reign in jerusalem and he imposed on judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold pharaoh neco made eliakim son of josiah king in place of his father josiah and changed eliakims name to jehoiakim but he took jehoahaz and carried him off to egypt and there he died jehoiakim paid pharaoh neco the silver and gold he demanded in order to do so he taxed the land and exacted the silver and gold from the people of the land according to their assessments jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eleven years his mothers name was zebidah daughter of pedaiah she was from rumah and he did evil in the eyes of the lord just as his fathers had done during jehoiakims reign nebuchadnezzar king of babylon invaded the land and jehoiakim became his vassal for three years but then he changed his mind and rebelled against nebuchadnezzar the lord sent babylonian aramean moabite and ammonite raiders against him he sent them to destroy judah in accordance with the word of the lord proclaimed by his servants the prophets surely these things happened to judah according to the lords command in order to remove them from his presence because of the sins of manasseh and all he had done including the shedding of innocent blood for he had filled jerusalem with innocent blood and the lord was not willing to forgive as for the other events of jehoiakims reign and all he did are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of judah jehoiakim rested with his fathers and jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king the king of egypt did not march out from his own country again because the king of babylon had taken all his territory from the wadi of egypt to the euphrates river jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem three months his mothers name was nehushta daughter of elnathan she was from jerusalem he did evil in the eyes of the lord just as his father had done at that time the officers of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon advanced on jerusalem and laid siege to it and nebuchadnezzar himself came up to the city while his officers were besieging it jehoiachin king of judah his mother his attendants his nobles and his officials all surrendered to him in the eighth year of the reign of the king of babylon he took jehoiachin prisoner as the lord had declared nebuchadnezzar removed all the treasures from the temple of the lord and from the royal palace and took away all the gold articles that solomon king of israel had made for the temple of the lord he carried into exile all jerusalem all the officers and fighting men and all the craftsmen and artisans a total of ten thousand only the poorest people of the land were left nebuchadnezzar took jehoiachin captive to babylon he also took from jerusalem to babylon the kings mother his wives his officials and the leading men of the land the king of babylon also deported to babylon the entire force of seven thousand fighting men strong and fit for war and a thousand craftsmen and artisans he made mattaniah jehoiachins uncle king in his place and changed his name to zedekiah zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eleven years his mothers name was hamutal daughter of jeremiah she was from libnah he did evil in the eyes of the lord just as jehoiakim had done it was because of the lords anger that all this happened to jerusalem and judah and in the end he thrust them from his presence now zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon so in the ninth year of zedekiahs reign on the tenth day of the tenth month nebuchadnezzar king of babylon marched against jerusalem with his whole army he encamped outside the city and built siege works all around it the city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of king zedekiah by the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat then the city wall was broken through and the whole army fled at night through the gate between the two walls near the kings garden though the babylonians were surrounding the city they

jonathan abinadab and malki shua the fighting grew fierce around saul and when the archers overtook him they wounded him saul said to his armor bearer draw your sword and run me through or these uncircumcised fellows will come and abuse me but his armor bearer was terrified and would not do it so saul took his own sword and fell on it when the armor bearer saw that saul was dead he too fell on his sword and died so saul and his three sons died and all his house died together when all the israelites in the valley saw that the army had fled and that saul and his sons had died they abandoned their towns and fled and the philistines came and occupied them the next day when the philistines came to strip the dead they found saul and his sons fallen on mount gilboa they stripped him and took his head and his armor and sent messengers throughout the land of the philistines to proclaim the news among their idols and their people they put his armor in the temple of their gods and hung up his head in the temple of dagon when all the inhabitants of jabesh gilead heard of everything the philistines had done to saul all their valiant men went and took the bodies of saul and his sons and brought them to jabesh then they buried their bones under the great tree in jabesh and they fasted seven days saul died because he was unfaithful to the lord he did not keep the word of the lord and even consulted a medium for guidance and did not inquire of the lord so the lord put him to death and turned the kingdom over to david son of jesse all israel came together to david at hebron and said we are your own flesh and blood in the past even while saul was king you were the one who led israel on their military campaigns and the lord your god said to you you will shepherd my people israel and you will become their ruler when all the elders of israel had come to king david at hebron he made a compact with them at hebron before the lord and they anointed david king over israel as the lord had promised through samuel david and all the israelites marched to jerusalem that is jebus the jebusites who lived there said to david you will not get in here nevertheless david captured the fortress of zion the city of david david had said whoever leads the attack on the jebusites will become commander in chief joab son of zeruiah went up first and so he received the command david then took up residence in the fortress and so it was called the city of david he built up the city around it from the supporting terraces to the surrounding wall while joab restored the rest of the city and david became more and more powerful because the lord almighty was with him these were the chiefs of davids mighty men they together with all israel gave his kingship strong support to extend it over the whole land as the lord had promised this is the list of davids mighty men jashobeam a hacmonite was chief of the officers he raised his spear against three hundred men whom he killed in one encounter next to him was eleazar son of dodai the ahohite one of the three mighty men he was with david at pas dammim when the philistines gathered there for battle at a place where there was a field full of barley the troops fled from the philistines but they took their stand in the middle of the field they defended it and struck the philistines down and the lord brought about a great victory three of the thirty chiefs came down to david to the rock at the cave of adullam while a band of philistines was encamped in the valley of rephaim at that time david was in the stronghold and the philistine garrison was at bethlehem david longed for water and said oh that someone would get me a drink of water from the well near the gate of bethlehem so the three broke through the philistine lines drew water from the well near the gate of bethlehem and carried it back to david but he refused to drink it instead he poured it out before the lord god forbid that i should do this he said should i drink the blood of these men who went at the risk of their lives because they risked their lives to bring it back david would not drink it such were the exploits of the three mighty men abishai the brother of joab was chief of the three he raised his spear against three hundred men whom he killed and so he became as famous as the three he was doubly honored above the three and became their commander even though he was not included among them benaiah son of jehoiada was a valiant fighter from kabzeel who performed great exploits he struck down two of moabs best men he also went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion and he struck down an egyptian who was seven and a half feet tall although the egyptian had a spear like a weavers rod in his hand benaiah went against him with a club he snatched the spear from the egyptians hand and killed him with his own spear such were the exploits of benaiah son of jehoiada he too was as famous as the three mighty men he was held in greater honor than any of the thirty but he was not included among the three and david put him in charge of his bodyguard the mighty men were asahel the brother of joab elhanan son of dodo from bethlehem shammoth the harorite helez the pelonite ira son of ikkesh from tekoa abiezer from anathoth sibbecai the hushathite ilai the ahohite maharai the netophathite heled son of baanah

son of shimri his brother joha the tizite eliel the mahavite jeribai and joshaviah the sons of elnaam ithmah the moabite eliel obed and jaasiel the mezobaite these were the men who came to david at ziklag while he was banished from the presence of saul son of kish they were among the warriors who helped him in battle they were armed with bows and were able to shoot arrows or to sling stones right handed or left handed they were kinsmen of saul from the tribe of benjamin ahiezer their chief and joash the sons of shemaah the gibeathite jeziel and pelet the sons of azmaveth beracah jehu the anathothite and ishmaiah the gibeonite a mighty man among the thirty who was a leader of the thirty jeremiah jahaziel johanan jozabad the gederathite eluzai jerimoth bealiah shemariah and shephatiah the haruphite elkanah isshiah azarel joezer and jashobeam the korahites and joelah and zebadiah the sons of jeroham from gedor some gadites defected to david at his stronghold in the desert they were brave warriors ready for battle and able to handle the shield and spear their faces were the faces of lions and they were as swift as gazelles in the mountains ezer was the chief obadiah the second in command eliab the third mishmannah the fourth jeremiah the fifth attai the sixth eliel the seventh johanan the eighth elzabad the ninth jeremiah the tenth and macbannai the eleventh these gadites were army commanders the least was a match for a hundred and the greatest for a thousand it was they who crossed the jordan in the first month when it was overflowing all its banks and they put to flight everyone living in the valleys to the east and to the west other benjamites and some men from judah also came to david in his stronghold david went out to meet them and said to them if you have come to me in peace to help me i am ready to have you unite with me but if you have come to betray me to my enemies when my hands are free from violence may the god of our fathers see it and judge you then the spirit came upon amasai chief of the thirty and he said we are yours o david we are with you o son of jesse success success to you and success to those who help you for your god will help you so david received them and made them leaders of his raiding bands some of the men of manasseh defected to david when he went with the philistines to fight against saul he and his men did not help the philistines because after consultation their rulers sent him away they said it will cost us our heads if he deserts to his master saul when david went to ziklag these were the men of manasseh who defected to him adnah jozabad jediael michael jozabad elihu and zillethai leaders of units of a thousand in manasseh they helped david against raiding bands for all of them were brave warriors and they were commanders in his army day after day men came to help david until he had a great army like the army of god these are the numbers of the men armed for battle who came to david at hebron to turn sauls kingdom over to him as the lord had said men of judah carrying shield and spear 6800 armed for battle men of simeon warriors ready for battle 7100 men of levi 4600 including jehoiada leader of the family of aaron with 3700 men and zadok a brave young warrior with 22 officers from his family men of benjamin sauls kinsmen 3000 most of whom had remained loyal to sauls house until then men of ephraim brave warriors famous in their own clans 20800 men of half the tribe of manasseh designated by name to come and make david king 18000 men of issachar who understood the times and knew what israel should do 200 chiefs with all their relatives under their command men of zebulun experienced soldiers prepared for battle with every type of weapon to help david with undivided loyalty 50000 men of naphtali 1000 officers together with 37000 men carrying shields and spears men of dan ready for battle 28600 men of asher experienced soldiers prepared for battle 40000 and from east of the jordan men of reuben gad and the half tribe of manasseh armed with every type of weapon 120000 all these were fighting men who volunteered to serve in the ranks they came to hebron fully determined to make david king over all israel all the rest of the israelites were also of one mind to make david king the men spent three days there with david eating and drinking for their families had supplied provisions for them also their neighbors from as far away as issachar zebulun and naphtali came bringing food on donkeys camels mules and oxen there were plentiful supplies of flour fig cakes raisin cakes wine oil cattle and sheep for there was joy in israel david conferred with each of his officers the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds he then said to the whole assembly of israel if it seems good to you and if it is the will of the lord our god let us send word far and wide to the rest of our brothers throughout the territories of israel and also to the priests and levites who are with them in their towns and pasturelands to come and join us let us bring the ark of our god back to us for we did not inquire of it during the reign of saul the whole assembly agreed to do this because it seemed right to all the people so david assembled all the israelites from the shihor river in egypt to lebo hamath to bring the ark of god from kiriath jearim david and all the israelites with him went to baalah of judah kiriath jearim to bring up from there the ark of god the lord who is enthroned between the cherubim the ark that is called by the name they moved the ark of god from abinadabs house on a new cart with uzzah and ahio guiding it david and all the israelites were celebrating with all their might before god with songs and with harps lyres tambourines cymbals and trumpets when they came to the threshing floor of kidon uzzah reached out his hand to steady the ark because the oxen stumbled the lords anger burned against uzzah and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark so he died there before god then david was angry because the lords wrath had broken out against uzzah and to this day that place is called perez uzzah david was afraid of god that day and asked how can i ever bring the ark of god to me he did not take the ark to be with him in the city of david instead he took it aside to the house of obed edom the gittite the ark of god remained with the family of obed edom in his house for three months and the lord blessed his household and everything he had now hiram king of tyre sent messengers to david along with cedar logs stonemasons and carpenters to build a palace for him and david knew that the lord had established him as king over israel and that his kingdom had been highly exalted for the sake of his people israel in jerusalem david took more wives and became the father of more sons and daughters these are the names of the children born to him there shammua shobab nathan solomon ibhar elishua elpelet nogah nepheg japhia elishama beeliada and eliphelet when the philistines heard that david had been anointed king over all israel they went up in full force to search for him but david heard about it and went out to meet them now the philistines had come and raided the valley of rephaim so david inquired of god shall i go and attack the philistines will you hand them over to me the lord answered him go i will hand them over to you so david and his men went up to baal perazim and there he defeated them he said as waters break out god has broken out against my enemies by my hand so that place was called baal perazim the philistines had abandoned their gods there and david gave orders to burn them in the fire once more the philistines raided the valley so david inquired of god again and god answered him do not go straight up but circle around them and attack them in front of the balsam trees as soon as you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees move out to battle because that will mean god has gone out in front of you to strike the philistine army so david did as god commanded him and they struck down the philistine army all the way from gibeon to gezer so davids fame spread throughout every land and the lord made all the nations fear him after david had constructed buildings for himself in the city of david he prepared a place for the ark of god and pitched a tent for it then david said no one but the levites may carry the ark of god because the lord chose them to carry the ark of the lord and to minister before him forever david assembled all israel in jerusalem to bring up the ark of the lord to the place he had prepared for it he called together the descendants of aaron and the levites from the descendants of kohath uriel the leader and 120 relatives from the descendants of merari asaiah the leader and 220 relatives from the descendants of gershon joel the leader and 130 relatives from the descendants of elizaphan shemaiah the leader and 200 relatives from the descendants of hebron eliel the leader and 80 relatives from the descendants of uzziel amminadab the leader and 112 relatives then david summoned zadok and abiathar the priests and uriel asaiah joel shemaiah eliel and amminadab the levites he said to them you are the heads of the levitical families you and your fellow levites are to consecrate yourselves and bring up the ark of the lord the god of israel to the place i have prepared for it it was because you the levites did not bring it up the first time that the lord our god broke out in anger against us we did not inquire of him about how to do it in the prescribed way so the priests and levites consecrated themselves in order to bring up the ark of the lord the god of israel and the levites carried the ark of god with the poles on their shoulders as moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the lord david told the leaders of the levites to appoint their brothers as singers to sing joyful songs accompanied by musical instruments lyres harps and cymbals so the levites appointed heman son of joel from his brothers asaph son of berekiah and from their brothers the merarites ethan son of kushaiah and with them their brothers next in rank zechariah jaaziel shemiramoth jehiel unni eliab benaiah maaseiah mattithiah eliphelehu mikneiah obed edom and jeiel the gatekeepers the musicians heman asaph and ethan were to sound the bronze cymbals zechariah aziel shemiramoth jehiel unni eliab maaseiah and benaiah were to play the lyres according to alamoth and mattithiah eliphelehu mikneiah obed edom jeiel and azaziah were to play the harps directing according to sheminith kenaniah the head levite was in charge of the singing that was his responsibility because he was skillful at it berekiah and elkanah were to be doorkeepers for the ark shebaniah joshaphat nethanel amasai zechariah benaiah and eliezer the priests were to blow trumpets before the ark of god obed edom and jehiah were also to be doorkeepers for the ark so david and the elders of israel and the commanders of units of a thousand went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the lord from the house of obed edom with rejoicing because god had helped the levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the lord seven bulls and seven rams were sacrificed now david was clothed in a robe of fine linen as were all the levites who were carrying the ark and as were the singers and kenaniah who was in charge of the singing of the choirs david also wore a linen ephod so all israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the lord with shouts with the sounding of rams horns and trumpets and of cymbals and the playing of lyres and harps as the ark of the covenant of the lord was entering the city of david michal daughter of saul watched from a window and when she saw king david dancing and celebrating she despised him in her heart they brought the ark of god and set it inside the tent that david had pitched for it and they presented burnt offerings and fellowship offerings before god after david had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and fellowship offerings he blessed the people in the name of the lord then he gave a loaf of bread a cake of dates and a cake of raisins to each israelite man and woman he appointed some of the levites to minister before the ark of the lord to make petition to give thanks and to praise the lord the god of israel asaph was the chief zechariah second then jeiel shemiramoth jehiel mattithiah eliab benaiah obed edom and jeiel they were to play the lyres and harps asaph was to sound the cymbals and benaiah and jahaziel the priests were to blow the trumpets regularly before the ark of the covenant of god that day david first committed to asaph and his associates this psalm of thanks to the lord give thanks to the lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done sing to him sing praise to him tell of all his wonderful acts glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who seek the lord rejoice look to the lord and his strength seek his face always remember the wonders he has done his miracles and the judgments he pronounced o descendants of israel his servant o sons of jacob his chosen ones he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he remembers his covenant forever the word he commanded for a thousand generations the covenant he made with abraham the oath he swore to isaac he confirmed it to jacob as a decree to israel as an everlasting covenant to you i will give the land of canaan as the portion you will inherit when they were but few in number few indeed and strangers in it they wandered from nation to nation from one kingdom to another he allowed no man to oppress them for their sake he rebuked kings do not touch my anointed ones do my prophets no harm sing to the lord all the earth proclaim his salvation day after day declare his glory among the nations his marvelous deeds among all peoples for great is the lord and most worthy of praise he is to be feared above all gods for all the gods of the nations are idols but the lord made the heavens splendor and majesty are before him strength and joy in his dwelling place ascribe to the lord o families of nations ascribe to the lord glory and strength ascribe to the lord the glory due his name bring an offering and come before him worship the lord in the splendor of his holiness tremble before him all the earth the world is firmly established it cannot be moved let the heavens rejoice let the earth be glad let them say among the nations the lord reigns let the sea resound and all that is in it let the fields be jubilant and everything in them then the trees of the forest will sing they will sing for joy before the lord for he comes to judge the earth give thanks to the lord for he is good his love endures forever cry out save us o god our savior gather us and deliver us from the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name that we may glory in your praise praise be to the lord the god of israel from everlasting to everlasting then all the people said amen and praise the lord david left asaph and his associates before the ark of the covenant of the lord to minister there regularly according to each days requirements he also left obed edom and his sixty eight associates to minister with them obed edom son of jeduthun and also hosah were gatekeepers david left zadok the priest and his fellow priests before the tabernacle of the lord at the high place in gibeon to present burnt offerings to the lord on the altar of burnt offering regularly morning and evening in accordance with everything written in the law of the lord which he had given israel with them were heman and jeduthun and the rest of those chosen and designated by name to give thanks to the lord for his love endures forever heman and jeduthun were responsible for the sounding of the trumpets and cymbals and for the playing of the other instruments for sacred song the sons of jeduthun were stationed at the gate then all the people left each for his own home and david returned home to bless his family after david was settled in his palace he said to nathan the prophet here i am living in a palace of cedar while the ark of the covenant of the lord is under a tent nathan replied to david whatever you have in mind do it for god is with you that night the word of god came to nathan saying go and tell my servant david this is what the lord says you are not the one to build me a house to dwell in i have not dwelt in a house from the day i brought israel up out of egypt to this day i have moved from one tent site to another from one dwelling place to another wherever i have moved with all the israelites did i ever say to any of their leaders whom i commanded to shepherd my people why have you not built me a house of cedar now then tell my servant david this is what the lord almighty says i took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people israel i have been with you wherever you have gone and i have cut off all your enemies from before you now i will make your name like the names of the greatest men of the earth and i will provide a place for my people israel and will plant them so that they can have a home of their own and no longer be disturbed wicked people will not oppress them anymore as they did at the beginning and have done ever since the time i appointed leaders over my people israel i will also subdue all your enemies i declare to you that the lord will build a house for you when your days are over and you go to be with your fathers i will raise up your offspring to succeed you one of your own sons and i will establish his kingdom he is the one who will build a house for me and i will establish his throne forever i will be his father and he will be my son i will never take my love away from him as i took it away from your predecessor i will set him over my house and my kingdom forever his throne will be established forever nathan reported to david all the words of this entire revelation then king david went in and sat before the lord and he said who am i o lord god and what is my family that you have brought me this far and as if this were not enough in your sight o god you have spoken about the future of the house of your servant you have looked on me as though i were the most exalted of men o lord god what more can david say to you for honoring your servant for you know your servant o lord for the sake of your servant and according to your will you have done this great thing and made known all these great promises there is no one like you o lord and there is no god but you as we have heard with our own ears and who is

were priests shavsha was secretary benaiah son of jehoiada was over the kerethites and pelethites and davids sons were chief officials at the kings side in the course of time nahash king of the ammonites died and his son succeeded him as king david thought i will show kindness to hanun son of nahash because his father showed kindness to me so david sent a delegation to express his sympathy to hanun concerning his father when davids men came to hanun in the land of the ammonites to express sympathy to him the ammonite nobles said to hanun do you think david is honoring your father by sending men to you to express sympathy havent his men come to you to explore and spy out the country and overthrow it so hanun seized davids men shaved them cut off their garments in the middle at the buttocks and sent them away when someone came and told david about the men he sent messengers to meet them for they were greatly humiliated the king said stay at jericho till your beards have grown and then come back when the ammonites realized that they had become a stench in davids nostrils hanun and the ammonites sent a thousand talents of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from aram naharaim aram maacah and zobah they hired thirty two thousand chariots and charioteers as well as the king of maacah with his troops who came and camped near medeba while the ammonites were mustered from their towns and moved out for battle on hearing this david sent joab out with the entire army of fighting men the ammonites came out and drew up in battle formation at the entrance to their city while the kings who had come were by themselves in the open country joab saw that there were battle lines in front of him and behind him so he selected some of the best troops in israel and deployed them against the arameans he put the rest of the men under the command of abishai his brother and they were deployed against the ammonites joab said if the arameans are too strong for me then you are to rescue me but if the ammonites are too strong for you then i will rescue you be strong and let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our god the lord will do what is good in his sight then joab and the troops with him advanced to fight the arameans and they fled before him when the ammonites saw that the arameans were fleeing they too fled before his brother abishai and went inside the city so joab went back to jerusalem after the arameans saw that they had been routed by israel they sent messengers and had arameans brought from beyond the river with shophach the commander of hadadezers army leading them when david was told of this he gathered all israel and crossed the jordan he advanced against them and formed his battle lines opposite them david formed his lines to meet the arameans in battle and they fought against him but they fled before israel and david killed seven thousand of their charioteers and forty thousand of their foot soldiers he also killed shophach the commander of their army when the vassals of hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by israel they made peace with david and became subject to him so the arameans were not willing to help the ammonites anymore in the spring at the time when kings go off to war joab led out the armed forces he laid waste the land of the ammonites and went to rabbah and besieged it but david remained in jerusalem joab attacked rabbah and left it in ruins david took the crown from the head of their king its weight was found to be a talent of gold and it was set with precious stones and it was placed on davids head he took a great quantity of plunder from the city and brought out the people who were there consigning them to labor with saws and with iron picks and axes david did this to all the ammonite towns then david and his entire army returned to jerusalem in the course of time war broke out with the philistines at gezer at that time sibbecai the hushathite killed sippai one of the descendants of the rephaites and the philistines were subjugated in another battle with the philistines elhanan son of jair killed lahmi the brother of goliath the gittite who had a spear with a shaft like a weavers rod in still another battle which took place at gath there was a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot twenty four in all he also was descended from rapha when he taunted israel jonathan son of shimea davids brother killed him these were descendants of rapha in gath and they fell at the hands of david and his men satan rose up against israel and incited david to take a census of israel so david said to joab and the commanders of the troops go and count the israelites from beersheba to dan then report back to me so that i may know how many there are but joab replied may the lord multiply his troops a hundred times over my lord the king are they not all my lords subjects why does my lord want to do this why should he bring guilt on israel the kings word however overruled joab so joab left and went throughout israel and then came back to jerusalem joab reported the number of the fighting men to david in all israel there were one million one hundred thousand men who could handle a sword including four hundred and seventy thousand in judah but joab did not include levi and benjamin in the numbering because the kings command was repulsive to him this command was also evil in the sight of god so he punished israel then david said to god i have sinned greatly by doing this now i beg you take away the guilt of your servant i have done a very foolish thing the lord said to gad davids seer go and tell david this is what the lord says i am giving you three options choose one of them for me to carry out against you so gad went to david and said to him this is what the lord says take your choice three years of famine three months of being swept away before your enemies with their swords overtaking you or three days of the sword of the lord days of plague in the land with the angel of the lord ravaging every part of israel now then decide how i should answer the one who sent me david said to gad i am in deep distress let me fall into the hands of the lord for his mercy is very great but do not let me fall into the hands of men so the lord sent a plague on israel and seventy thousand men of israel fell dead and god sent an angel to destroy jerusalem but as the angel was doing so the lord saw it and was grieved because of the calamity and said to the angel who was destroying the people enough withdraw your hand the angel of the lord was then standing at the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite david looked up and saw the angel of the lord standing between heaven and earth with a drawn sword in his hand extended over jerusalem then david and the elders clothed in sackcloth fell facedown david said to god was it not i who ordered the fighting men to be counted i am the one who has sinned and done wrong these are but sheep what have they done o lord my god let your hand fall upon me and my family but do not let this plague remain on your people then the angel of the lord ordered gad to tell david to go up and build an altar to the lord on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite so david went up in obedience to the word that gad had spoken in the name of the lord while araunah was threshing wheat he turned and saw the angel his four sons who were with him hid themselves then david approached and when araunah looked and saw him he left the threshing floor and bowed down before david with his face to the ground david said to him let me have the site of your threshing floor so i can build an altar to the lord that the plague on the people may be stopped sell it to me at the full price araunah said to david take it let my lord the king do whatever pleases him look i will give the oxen for the burnt offerings the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for the grain offering i will give all this but king david replied to araunah no i insist on paying the full price i will not take for the lord what is yours or sacrifice a burnt offering that costs me nothing so david paid araunah six hundred shekels of gold for the site david built an altar to the lord there and sacrificed burnt offerings and fellowship offerings he called on the lord and the lord answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering then the lord spoke to the angel and he put his sword back into its sheath at that time when david saw that the lord had answered him on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite he offered sacrifices there the tabernacle of the lord which moses had made in the desert and the altar of burnt offering were at that time on the high place at gibeon but david could not go before it to inquire of god because he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the lord then david said the house of the lord god is to be here and also the altar of burnt offering for israel so david gave orders to assemble the aliens living in israel and from among them he appointed stonecutters to prepare dressed stone for building the house of god he provided a large amount of iron to make nails for the doors of the gateways and for the fittings and more bronze than could be weighed he also provided more cedar logs than could be counted for the sidonians and tyrians had brought large numbers of them to david david said my son solomon is young and inexperienced and the house to be built for the lord should be of great magnificence and fame and splendor in the sight of all the nations therefore i will make preparations for it so david made extensive preparations before his death then he called for his son solomon and charged him to build a house for the lord the god of israel david said to solomon my son i had it in my heart to build a house for the name of the lord my god but this word of the lord came to me you have shed much blood and have fought many wars you are not to build a house for my name because you have shed much blood on the earth in my sight but you will have a son who will be a man of peace and rest and i will give him rest from all his enemies on every side his name will be solomon and i will grant israel peace and quiet during his reign he is the one who will build a house for my name he will be my son and i will be his father and i will establish the throne of his kingdom over israel forever now my son the lord be with you and may you have success and build the house of the lord your god as he said you would may the lord give you discretion and understanding when he puts you in command over israel so that you may keep the law of the lord your god then you will have success if you are careful to observe the decrees and laws that the lord gave moses for israel be strong and courageous do not be afraid or discouraged i have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the lord a hundred thousand talents of gold a million talents of silver quantities of bronze and iron too great to be weighed and wood and stone and you may add to them you have many workmen stonecutters masons and carpenters as well as men skilled in every kind of work in gold and silver bronze and iron craftsmen beyond number now begin the work and the lord be with you then david ordered all the leaders of israel to help his son solomon he said to them is not the lord your god with you and has he not granted you rest on every side for he has handed the inhabitants of the land over to me and the land is subject to the lord and to his people now devote your heart and soul to seeking the lord your god begin to build the sanctuary of the lord god so that you may bring the ark of the covenant of the lord and the sacred articles belonging to god into the temple that will be built for the name of the lord when david was old and full of years he made his son solomon king over israel he also gathered together all the leaders of israel as well as the priests and levites the levites thirty years old or more were counted and the total number of men was thirty eight thousand david said of these twenty four thousand are to supervise the work of the temple of the lord and six thousand are to be officials and judges four thousand are to be gatekeepers and four thousand are to praise the lord with the musical instruments i have provided for that purpose david divided the levites into groups corresponding to the sons of levi gershon kohath and merari belonging to the gershonites ladan and shimei the sons of ladan jehiel the first zetham and joel three in all the sons of shimei shelomoth haziel and haran three in all these were the heads of the families of ladan and the sons of shimei jahath ziza jeush and beriah these were the sons of shimei four in all jahath was the first and ziza the second but jeush and beriah did not have many sons so they were counted as one family with one assignment the sons of kohath amram izhar hebron and uzziel four in all the sons of amram aaron and moses aaron was set apart he and his descendants forever to consecrate the most holy things to offer sacrifices before the lord to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in his name forever the sons of moses the man of god were counted as part of the tribe of levi the sons of moses gershom and eliezer the descendants of gershom

levi by their families the heads of families as they were registered under their names and counted individually that is the workers twenty years old or more who served in the temple of the lord for david had said since the lord the god of israel has granted rest to his people and has come to dwell in jerusalem forever the levites no longer need to carry the tabernacle or any of the articles used in its service according to the last instructions of david the levites were counted from those twenty years old or more the duty of the levites was to help aarons descendants in the service of the

descendants of aaron for the service of the temple of the lord these were the divisions of the sons of aaron the sons of aaron were nadab abihu eleazar and ithamar but nadab and abihu died before

have provided for building you a temple for your holy name it comes from your hand and all of it belongs to you i know my god that you test the heart and are pleased with integrity all these things

in the hearts of your people forever and keep their hearts loyal to you and give my son solomon the wholehearted devotion to keep your commands requirements and decrees and to do everything to build the palatial structure for which i have provided then david said to the whole assembly praise the lord your god so they all praised the lord the god of their fathers they bowed low and fell prostrate before the lord and the king the next day they made sacrifices to the lord and presented burnt offerings to him a thousand bulls a thousand rams and a thousand male lambs together with their drink offerings and other sacrifices in abundance for all israel they ate and drank with great joy in the presence of the lord that day then they acknowledged solomon son of david as king a second time anointing him before the lord to be ruler and zadok to be priest so solomon sat on the throne of the lord as king in place of his father david he prospered and all israel obeyed him all the officers and mighty men as well as all of king davids sons pledged their submission to king solomon the lord highly exalted solomon in the sight of all israel and bestowed on him royal splendor such as no king over israel ever had before david son of jesse was king over all israel he ruled over israel forty years seven in hebron and thirty three in jerusalem he died at a good old age having enjoyed long life wealth and honor his son solomon succeeded him as king as for the events of king davids reign from beginning to end they are written in the records of samuel the seer the records of nathan the prophet and the records of gad the seer together with the details of his reign and power and the circumstances that surrounded him and israel and the kingdoms of all the other lands  solomon son of david established himself firmly over his kingdom for the lord his god was with him and made him exceedingly great then solomon spoke to all israel to the commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds to the judges and to all the leaders in israel the heads of families and solomon and the whole assembly went to the high place at gibeon for gods tent of meeting was there which moses the lords servant had made in the desert now david had brought up the ark of god from kiriath jearim to the place he had prepared for it because he had pitched a tent for it in jerusalem but the bronze altar that bezalel son of uri the son of hur had made was in gibeon in front of the tabernacle of the lord so solomon and the assembly inquired of him there solomon went up to the bronze altar before the lord in the tent of meeting and offered a thousand burnt offerings on it that night god appeared to solomon and said to him ask for whatever you want me to give you solomon answered god you have shown great kindness to david my father and have made me king in his place now lord god let your promise to my father david be confirmed for you have made me king over a people who are as numerous as the dust of the earth give me wisdom and knowledge that i may lead this people for who is able to govern this great people of yours god said to solomon since this is your hearts desire and you have not asked for wealth riches or honor nor for the death of your enemies and since you have not asked for a long life but for wisdom and knowledge to govern my people over whom i have made you king therefore wisdom and knowledge will be given you and i will also give you wealth riches and honor such as no king who was before you ever had and none after you will have then solomon went to jerusalem from the high place at gibeon from before the tent of meeting and he reigned over israel solomon accumulated chariots and horses he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horses which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in jerusalem the king made silver and gold as common in jerusalem as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamore fig trees in the foothills solomons horses were imported from egypt and from kue the royal merchants purchased them from kue they imported a chariot from egypt for six hundred shekels of silver and a horse for a hundred and fifty they also exported them to all the kings of the hittites and of the arameans solomon gave orders to build a temple for the name of the lord and a royal palace for himself he conscripted seventy thousand men as carriers and eighty thousand as stonecutters in the hills and thirty six hundred as foremen over them solomon sent this message to hiram king of tyre send me cedar logs as you did for my father david when you sent him cedar to build a palace to live in now i am about to build a temple for the name of the lord my god and to dedicate it to him for burning fragrant incense before him for

were in israel after the census his father david had taken and they were found to be 153600 he assigned 70000 of them to be carriers and 80000 to be stonecutters in the hills with 3600 foremen over them to keep the people working then solomon began to build the temple of the lord in jerusalem on mount moriah where the lord had appeared to his father david it was on the threshing floor of araunah the jebusite the place provided by david he began building on the second day of the second month in the fourth year of his reign the foundation solomon laid for building the temple of god was sixty cubits long and twenty cubits wide using the cubit of the old standard the portico at the front of the temple was twenty cubits long across the width of the building and twenty cubits high he overlaid

long and touched the temple wall while its other wing also five cubits long touched the wing of the other cherub similarly one wing of the second cherub was five cubits long and touched the other

curtain of blue purple and crimson yarn and fine linen with cherubim worked into it in the front of the temple he made two pillars which together were thirty five cubits long each with a capital on top measuring five cubits he made interwoven chains and put them on top of the pillars he also made a hundred pomegranates and attached them to the chains he erected the pillars in the front of the temple one to the south and one to the north the one to the south he named jakin and the one to the north boaz he made a bronze altar twenty cubits long twenty cubits wide and ten cubits high he made the sea of cast metal circular in shape measuring ten cubits from rim to rim and five cubits high it took a line of thirty cubits to measure around it below the rim figures of bulls encircled it ten to a cubit the bulls were cast in two rows in one piece with the sea the sea stood on twelve bulls three facing north three facing west three facing south and three facing east the sea rested on top of them and their hindquarters were toward the center it was a handbreadth in thickness and its rim was like the rim of a cup like a lily blossom it held three thousand baths he then made ten basins for washing and placed five on the south side and five on the north in them the things to be used for the burnt offerings were rinsed but the sea was to be used by the priests for washing he made ten gold lampstands according to the specifications for them and placed them in the temple five on the south side and five on the north he made ten tables and placed them in the temple five on the south

network two rows of pomegranates for each network decorating the bowl shaped capitals on top of the pillars the stands with their basins the sea and the twelve bulls under it the pots shovels meat forks and all related articles all the objects that huram abi made for king solomon for the temple of the lord were of polished bronze the king had them cast in clay molds in the plain of the jordan between succoth and zarethan all these things that solomon made amounted to so much that the weight of the bronze was not determined solomon also made all the furnishings that were in gods temple the golden altar the tables on which was the bread of the presence the lampstands of pure gold with their lamps to burn in front of the inner sanctuary as prescribed the gold floral work and lamps and tongs they were solid gold the pure gold wick trimmers sprinkling bowls dishes and censers and the gold doors of the temple the inner doors to the most holy place and the doors of the main hall when all the work solomon had done for the temple of the lord was finished he brought in the things his father david had dedicated the silver and gold and all the furnishings and he placed them in the treasuries of gods temple then solomon summoned to jerusalem the elders of israel all the heads of the tribes and the chiefs of the israelite families to bring up the ark of the lords covenant from zion the city of david and all the men of israel came together to the king at the time of the festival in the seventh month when all the elders of israel had arrived the levites took up the ark and they brought up the ark and the tent of meeting and all the sacred furnishings in it the priests who were levites carried them up and king solomon and the entire assembly of israel that had gathered about him were before the ark sacrificing so many sheep and cattle that they could not be recorded or counted the priests then brought the ark of the lords covenant to its place in the inner sanctuary of the temple the most holy place and put it beneath the wings of the cherubim the cherubim spread their wings over the place of the ark and covered the ark and its carrying poles these poles were so long that their ends extending from the ark could be seen from in front of the inner sanctuary but not from outside the holy place and they are still there today there was nothing in the ark except the two tablets that moses had placed in it at horeb where the lord made a covenant with the israelites after they came out of egypt the priests then withdrew from the holy place all the priests who were there had consecrated themselves regardless of their divisions all the levites who were musicians asaph heman jeduthun and their sons and relatives stood on the east side of the altar dressed in fine linen and playing cymbals harps and lyres they were accompanied by 120 priests sounding trumpets the trumpeters and singers joined in unison as with one voice to give praise and thanks to the lord accompanied by trumpets cymbals and other instruments they raised their voices in praise to the lord and sang he is good his love endures forever then the temple of the lord was filled with a cloud and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the lord filled the temple of god then solomon said the lord has said that he would dwell in a dark cloud i have built a magnificent temple for you a place for you to dwell forever while the whole assembly of israel was standing there the king turned around and blessed them then he said praise be to the lord the god of israel who with his hands has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to my father david for he said since the day i brought my people out of egypt i have not chosen a city in any tribe of israel to have a temple built for my name to be there nor have i chosen anyone to be the leader over my people israel but now i have chosen jerusalem for my name to be there and i have chosen david to rule my people israel my father david had it in his heart to build a temple for the name of the lord the god of israel but the lord said to my father david because it was in your heart to build a temple for my name you did well to have this in your heart nevertheless you are not the one to build the temple but your son who is your own flesh and blood he is the one who will build the temple for my name the lord has kept the promise he made i have succeeded david my father and now i sit on the throne of israel just as the lord promised and i have built the temple for the name of the lord the god of israel there i have placed the ark in which is the covenant of the lord that he made with the people of israel then solomon stood before the altar of the lord in front of the whole assembly of israel and spread out his hands now he had made a bronze platform five cubits long five cubits wide and three cubits high and had placed it in the center of the outer court he stood on the platform and then knelt down before the whole assembly of israel and spread out his hands toward heaven he said o lord god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on earth you who keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way you have kept your promise to your servant david my father with your mouth you have promised and with your hand you have fulfilled it as it is today now lord god of israel keep for your servant david my father the promises you made to him when you said you shall never fail to have a man to sit before me on the throne of israel if only your sons are careful in all they do to walk before me according to my law as you have done and now o lord god of israel let your word that you promised your servant david come true but will god really dwell on earth with men the heavens even the highest heavens cannot contain you how much less this temple i have built yet give attention to your servants prayer and his plea for mercy o lord my god hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is praying in your presence may your eyes be open toward this temple day and night this place of which you said you would put your name there may you hear the prayer your servant prays toward this place hear the supplications of your servant and of your people israel when they pray toward this place hear from heaven your dwelling place and when you hear forgive when a man wrongs his neighbor and is required to take an oath and he comes and swears the oath before your altar in this temple then hear from heaven and act judge between your servants repaying the guilty by bringing down on his own head what he has done declare the innocent not guilty and so establish his innocence when your people israel have been defeated by an enemy because they have sinned against you and when they turn back and confess your name praying and making supplication before you in this temple then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people israel and bring them back to the land you gave to them and their fathers when the heavens are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you and when they pray toward this place and confess your name and turn from their sin because you have afflicted them then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your servants your people israel teach them the right way to live and send rain on the land you gave your people for an inheritance when famine or plague comes to the land or blight or mildew locusts or grasshoppers or when enemies besiege them in any of their cities whatever disaster or disease may come and when a prayer or plea is made by any of your people israel each one aware of his afflictions and pains and spreading out his hands toward this temple then hear from heaven your dwelling place forgive and deal with each man according to all he does since you know his heart for you alone know the hearts of men so that they will fear you and walk in your ways all the time they live in the land you gave our fathers as for the foreigner who does not belong to your people israel but has come from a distant land because of your great name and your mighty hand and your outstretched arm when he comes and prays toward this temple then hear from heaven your dwelling place and do whatever the foreigner asks of you so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you as do your own people israel and may know that this house i have built bears your name when your people go to war against their enemies wherever you send them and when they pray to you toward this city you have chosen and the temple i have built for your name then hear from heaven their prayer and their plea and uphold their cause when they sin against you for there is no one who does not sin and you become angry with them and give them over to the enemy who takes them captive to a land far away or near and if they have a change of heart in the land where they are held captive and repent and plead with you in the land of their captivity and say we have sinned we have done wrong and acted wickedly and if they turn back to you with all their heart and soul in the land of their captivity where they were taken and pray toward the land you gave their fathers toward the city you have chosen and toward the temple i have built for your name then from heaven your dwelling place hear their prayer and their pleas and uphold their cause and forgive your people who have sinned against you now my god may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place now arise o lord god and come to your resting place you and the ark of your might may your priests o lord god be clothed with salvation may your saints rejoice in your goodness o lord god do not reject your anointed one remember the great love promised to david your servant when solomon finished praying fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the lord filled the temple the priests could not enter the temple of the lord because the glory of the lord filled it when all the israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the lord above the temple they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground and they worshiped and gave thanks to the lord saying he is good his love endures forever then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the lord and king solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty two thousand head of cattle and a hundred and twenty thousand sheep and goats so the king and all the people dedicated the temple of god the priests took their positions as did the levites with the lords musical instruments which king david had made for praising the lord and which were used when he gave thanks saying his love endures forever opposite the levites the priests blew their trumpets and all the israelites were standing solomon consecrated the middle part of the courtyard in front of the temple of the lord and there he offered burnt offerings and the fat of the fellowship offerings because the bronze altar he had made could not hold the burnt offerings the grain offerings and the fat portions so solomon observed the festival at that time for seven days and all israel with him a vast assembly people from lebo hamath to the wadi of egypt on the eighth day they held an assembly for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the festival for seven days more on the twenty third day of the seventh month he sent the people to their homes joyful and glad in heart for the good things the lord had done for david and solomon and for his people israel when solomon had finished the temple of the lord and the royal palace and had succeeded in carrying out all he had in mind to do in the temple of the lord and in his own palace the lord appeared to him at night and said i have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for myself as a temple for sacrifices when i shut up the heavens so that there is no rain or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayers offered in this place i have chosen and consecrated this temple so that my name may be there forever my eyes and my heart will always be there as for you if you walk before me as david your father did and do all i command and observe my decrees and laws i will establish your royal throne as i covenanted with david your father when i said you shall never fail to have a man to rule over israel but if you turn away and forsake the decrees and commands i have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them then i will uproot israel from my land which i have given them and will reject this temple i have consecrated for my name i will make it a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples and though this temple is now so imposing all who pass by will be appalled and say why has the lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple people will answer because they have forsaken the lord the god of their fathers who brought them out of egypt and have embraced other gods worshiping and serving them that is why he brought all this disaster on them at the end of twenty years during which solomon built the temple of the lord and his own palace solomon rebuilt the villages that hiram had given him and settled israelites in them solomon then went to hamath zobah and captured it he also built up tadmor in the desert and all the store cities he had built in hamath he rebuilt upper beth horon and lower beth horon as fortified cities with walls and with gates and bars as well as baalath and all his store cities and all the cities for his chariots and for his horses whatever he desired to build in jerusalem in lebanon and throughout all the territory he ruled all the people left from the hittites amorites perizzites hivites and jebusites these peoples were not israelites that is their descendants remaining in the land whom the israelites had not destroyed these solomon conscripted for his slave labor force as it is to this day but solomon did not make slaves of the israelites for his work they were his fighting men commanders of his captains and commanders of his chariots and charioteers they were also king solomons chief officials two hundred and fifty officials supervising the men solomon brought pharaohs daughter up from the city of david to the palace he had built for her for he said my wife must not live in the palace of david king of israel because the places the ark of the lord has entered are holy on the altar of the lord that he had built in front of the portico solomon sacrificed burnt offerings to the lord according to the daily requirement for offerings commanded by moses for sabbaths new moons and the three annual feasts the feast of unleavened bread the feast of weeks and the feast of tabernacles in keeping with the ordinance of his father david he appointed the divisions of the priests for their duties and the levites to lead the praise and to assist the priests according to each days requirement he also appointed the gatekeepers by divisions for the various gates because this was what david the man of god had ordered they did not deviate from the kings commands to the priests or to the levites in any matter including that of the treasuries all solomons work was carried out from the day the foundation of the temple of the lord was laid until its completion so the temple of the lord was finished then solomon went to ezion geber and elath on the coast of edom and hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers men who knew the sea these with solomons men sailed to ophir and brought back four hundred and fifty talents of gold which they delivered to king solomon when the queen of sheba heard of solomons fame she came to jerusalem to test him with hard questions arriving with a very great caravan with camels carrying spices large quantities of gold and precious stones she came to solomon and talked with him about all she had on her mind solomon answered all her questions nothing was too hard for him to explain to her when the queen of sheba saw the wisdom of solomon as well as the palace he had built the food on his table the seating of his officials the attending servants in their robes the cupbearers in their robes and the burnt offerings he made at the temple of the lord she was overwhelmed she said to the king the report i heard in my own country about your achievements and your wisdom is true but i did not believe what they said until i came and saw with my own eyes indeed not even half the greatness of your wisdom was told me you have far exceeded the report i heard how happy your men must be how happy your officials who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom praise be to the lord your god who has delighted in you and placed you on his throne as king to rule for the lord your god because of the love of your god for israel and his desire to uphold them forever he has made you king over them to maintain justice and righteousness then she gave the king 120 talents of gold large quantities of spices and precious stones there had never been such spices as those the queen of sheba gave to king solomon the men of hiram and the men of solomon brought gold from ophir they also brought algumwood and precious stones the king used the algumwood to make steps for the temple of the lord and for the royal palace and to make harps and lyres for the musicians nothing like them had ever been seen in judah king solomon gave the queen of sheba all she desired and asked for he gave her more than she had brought to him then she left and returned with her retinue to her own country the weight of the gold that solomon received yearly was 666 talents not including the revenues brought in by merchants and traders also all the kings of arabia and the governors of the land brought gold and silver to solomon king solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold six hundred bekas of hammered gold went into each shield he also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold with three hundred bekas of gold in each shield the king put them in the palace of the forest of lebanon then the king made a great throne inlaid with ivory and overlaid with pure gold the throne had six steps and a footstool of gold was attached to it on both sides of the seat were armrests with a lion standing beside each of them twelve lions stood on the six steps one at either end of each step nothing like it had ever been made for any other kingdom all king solomons goblets were gold and all the household articles in the palace of the forest of lebanon were pure gold nothing was made of silver because silver was considered of little value in solomons day the king had a fleet of trading ships manned by hirams men once every three years it returned carrying gold silver and ivory and apes and baboons king solomon was greater in riches and wisdom than all the other kings of the earth all the kings of the earth sought audience with solomon to hear the wisdom god had put in his heart year after year everyone who came brought a gift articles of silver and gold and robes weapons and spices and horses and mules solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots and twelve thousand horses which he kept in the chariot cities and also with him in jerusalem he ruled over all the kings from the river to the land of the philistines as far as the border of egypt the king made silver as common in jerusalem as stones and cedar as plentiful as sycamore fig trees in the foothills solomons horses were imported from egypt and from all other countries as for the other events of solomons reign from beginning to end are they not written in the records of nathan the prophet in the prophecy of ahijah the shilonite and in the visions of iddo the seer concerning jeroboam son of nebat solomon reigned in jerusalem over all israel forty years then he rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david his father and rehoboam his son succeeded him as king rehoboam went to shechem for all the israelites had gone there to make him king when jeroboam son of nebat heard this he was in egypt where he had fled from king solomon he returned from egypt so they sent for jeroboam and he and all israel went to rehoboam and said to him your father put a heavy yoke on us but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us and we will serve you rehoboam answered come back to me in three days so the people went away then king rehoboam consulted the elders who had served his father solomon during his lifetime how would you advise me to answer these people he asked they replied if you will be kind to these people and please them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants but rehoboam rejected the advice the elders gave him and consulted the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him he asked them what is your advice how should we answer these people who say to me lighten the yoke your father put on us the young men who had grown up with him replied tell the people who have said to you your father put a heavy yoke on us but make our yoke lighter tell them my little finger is thicker than my fathers waist my father laid on you a heavy yoke i will make it even heavier my father scourged you with whips i will scourge you with scorpions three days later jeroboam and all the people returned to rehoboam as the king had said come back to me in three days the king answered them harshly rejecting the advice of the elders he followed the advice of the young men and said my father made your yoke heavy i will make it even heavier my father scourged you with whips i will scourge you with scorpions so the king did not listen to the people for this turn of events was from god to fulfill the word the lord had spoken to jeroboam son of nebat through ahijah the shilonite when all israel saw that the king refused to listen to them they answered the king what share do we have in david what part in jesses son to your tents o israel look after your own house o david so all the israelites went home but as for the israelites who were living in the towns of judah rehoboam still ruled over them king rehoboam sent out adoniram who was in charge of forced labor but the israelites stoned him to death king rehoboam however managed to get into his chariot and escape to jerusalem so israel has been in rebellion against the house of david to this day when rehoboam arrived in jerusalem he mustered the house of judah and benjamin a hundred and eighty thousand fighting men to make war against israel and to regain the kingdom for rehoboam but this word of the lord came to shemaiah the man of god say to rehoboam son of solomon king of judah and to all the israelites in judah and benjamin this is what the lord says do not go up to fight against your brothers go home every one of you for this is my doing so they obeyed the words of the lord and turned back from marching against jeroboam rehoboam lived in jerusalem and built up towns for defense in judah bethlehem etam tekoa beth zur soco adullam gath mareshah ziph adoraim lachish azekah zorah aijalon and hebron these were fortified cities in judah and benjamin he strengthened their defenses and put commanders in them with supplies of food olive oil and wine he put shields and spears in all the cities and made them very strong so judah and benjamin were his the priests and levites from all their districts throughout israel sided with him the levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and came to judah and jerusalem because jeroboam and his sons had rejected them as priests of the lord and he appointed his own priests for the high places and for the goat and calf idols he had made those from every tribe of israel who set their hearts on seeking the lord the god of israel followed the levites to jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the lord the god of their fathers they strengthened the kingdom of judah and supported rehoboam son of solomon three years walking in the ways of david and solomon during this time rehoboam married mahalath who was the daughter of davids son jerimoth and of abihail the daughter of jesses son eliab she bore him sons jeush shemariah and zaham then he married maacah daughter of absalom who bore him abijah attai ziza and shelomith rehoboam loved maacah daughter of absalom more than any of his other wives and concubines in all he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines twenty eight sons and sixty daughters rehoboam appointed abijah son of maacah to be the chief prince among his brothers in order to make him king he acted wisely dispersing some of his sons throughout the districts of judah and benjamin and to all the fortified cities he gave them abundant provisions and took many wives for them after rehoboams position as king was established and he had become strong he and all israel with him abandoned the law of the lord because they had been unfaithful to the lord shishak king of egypt attacked jerusalem in the fifth year of king rehoboam with twelve hundred chariots and sixty thousand horsemen and the innumerable troops of libyans sukkites and cushites that came with him from egypt he captured the fortified cities of judah and came as far as jerusalem then the prophet shemaiah came to rehoboam and to the leaders of judah who had assembled in jerusalem for fear of shishak and he said to them this is what the lord says you have abandoned me therefore i now abandon you to shishak the leaders of israel and the king humbled themselves and said the lord is just when the lord saw that they humbled themselves this word of the lord came to shemaiah since they have humbled themselves i will not destroy them but will soon give them deliverance my wrath will not be poured out on jerusalem through shishak they will however become subject to him so that they may learn the difference between serving me and serving the kings of other lands when shishak king of egypt attacked jerusalem he carried off the treasures of the temple of the lord and the treasures of the royal palace he took everything including the gold shields solomon had made so king rehoboam made bronze shields to replace them and assigned these to the commanders of the guard on duty at the entrance to the royal palace whenever the king went to the lords temple the guards went with him bearing the shields and afterward they returned them to the guardroom because rehoboam humbled himself the lords anger turned from him and he was not totally destroyed indeed there was some good in judah king rehoboam established himself firmly in jerusalem and continued as king he was forty one years old when he became king and he reigned seventeen years in jerusalem the city the lord had chosen out of all the tribes of israel in which to put his name his mothers name was naamah she was an ammonite he did evil because he had not set his heart on seeking the lord as for the events of rehoboams reign from beginning to end are they not written in the records of shemaiah the prophet and of iddo the seer that deal with genealogies there was continual warfare between rehoboam and jeroboam rehoboam rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and abijah his son succeeded him as king in the eighteenth year of the reign of jeroboam abijah became king of judah and he reigned in jerusalem three years his mothers name was maacah a daughter of uriel of gibeah there was war between abijah and jeroboam abijah went into battle with a force of four hundred thousand able fighting men and jeroboam drew up a battle line against him with eight hundred thousand able troops abijah stood on mount zemaraim in the hill country of ephraim and said jeroboam and all israel listen to me dont you know that the lord the god of israel has given the kingship of israel to david and his descendants forever by a covenant of salt yet jeroboam son of nebat an official of solomon son of david rebelled against his master some worthless scoundrels gathered around him and opposed rehoboam son of solomon when he was young and indecisive and not strong enough to resist them and now you plan to resist the kingdom of the lord which is in the hands of davids descendants you are indeed a vast army and have with you the golden calves that jeroboam made to be your gods but didnt you drive out the priests of the lord the sons of aaron and the levites and make priests of your own as the peoples of other lands do whoever comes to consecrate himself with a young bull and seven rams may become a priest of what are not gods as for us the lord is our god and we have not forsaken him the priests who serve the lord are sons of aaron and the levites assist them every morning and evening they present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the lord they set out the bread on the ceremonially clean table and light the lamps on the gold lampstand every evening we are observing the requirements of the lord our god but you have forsaken him god is with us he is our leader his priests with their trumpets will sound the battle cry against you men of israel do not fight against the lord the god of your fathers for you will not succeed now jeroboam had sent troops around to the rear so that while he was in front of judah the ambush was behind them judah turned and saw that they were being attacked at both front and rear then they cried out to the lord the priests blew their trumpets and the men of judah raised the battle cry at the sound of their battle cry god routed jeroboam and all israel before abijah and judah the israelites fled before judah and god delivered them into their hands abijah and his men inflicted heavy losses on them so that there were five hundred thousand casualties among israels able men the men of israel were subdued on that occasion and the men of judah were victorious because they relied on the lord the god of their fathers abijah pursued jeroboam and took from him the towns of bethel jeshanah and ephron with their surrounding villages jeroboam did not regain power during the time of abijah and the lord struck him down and he died but abijah grew in strength he married fourteen wives and had twenty two sons and sixteen daughters the other events of abijahs reign what he did and what he said are written in the annotations of the prophet iddo and abijah rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david asa his son succeeded him as king and in his days the country was at peace for ten years asa did what was good and right in the eyes of the lord his god he removed the foreign altars and the high places smashed the sacred stones and cut down the asherah poles he commanded judah to seek the lord the god of their fathers and to obey his laws and commands he removed the high places and incense altars in every town in judah and the kingdom was at peace under him he built up the fortified cities of judah since the land was at peace no one was at war with him during those years for the lord gave him rest let us build up these towns he said to judah and put walls around them with towers gates and bars the land is still ours because we have sought the lord our god we sought him and he has given us rest on every side so they built and prospered asa had an army of three hundred thousand men from judah equipped with large shields and with spears and two hundred and eighty thousand from benjamin armed with small shields and with bows all these were brave fighting men zerah the cushite marched out against them with a vast army and three hundred chariots and came as far as mareshah asa went out to meet him and they took up battle positions in the valley of zephathah near mareshah then asa called to the lord his god and said lord there is no one like you to help the powerless against the mighty help us o lord our god for we rely on you and in your name we have come against this vast army o lord you are our god do not let man prevail against you the lord struck down the cushites before asa and judah the cushites fled and asa and his army pursued them as far as gerar such a great number of cushites fell that they could not recover they were crushed before the lord and his forces the men of judah carried off a large amount of plunder they destroyed all the villages around gerar for the terror of the lord had fallen upon them they plundered all these villages since there was much booty there they also attacked the camps of the herdsmen and carried off droves of sheep and goats and camels then they returned to jerusalem the spirit of god came upon azariah son of oded he went out to meet asa and said to him listen to me asa and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you when you are with him if you seek him he will be found by you but if you forsake him he will forsake you for a long time israel was without the true god without a priest to teach and without the law but in their distress they turned to the lord the god of israel and sought him and he was found by them in those days it was not safe to travel about for all the inhabitants of the lands were in great turmoil one nation was being crushed by another and one city by another because god was troubling them with every kind of distress but as for you be strong and do not give up for your work will be rewarded when asa heard these words and the prophecy of azariah son of oded the prophet he took courage he removed the detestable idols from the whole land of judah and benjamin and from the towns he had captured in the hills of ephraim he repaired the altar of the lord that was in front of the portico of the lords temple then he assembled all judah and benjamin and the people from ephraim manasseh and simeon who had settled among them for large numbers had come over to him from israel when they saw that the lord his god was with him they assembled at jerusalem in the third month of the fifteenth year of asas reign at that time they sacrificed to the lord seven hundred head of cattle and seven thousand sheep and goats from the plunder they had brought back they entered into a covenant to seek the lord the god of their fathers with all their heart and soul all who would not seek the lord the god of israel were to be put to death whether small or great man or woman they took an oath to the lord with loud acclamation with shouting and with trumpets and horns all judah rejoiced about the oath because they had sworn it wholeheartedly they sought god eagerly and he was found by them so the lord gave them rest on every side king asa also deposed his grandmother maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made a repulsive asherah pole asa cut the pole down broke it up and burned it in the kidron valley although he did not remove the high places from israel asas heart was fully committed to the lord all his life he brought into the temple of god the silver and gold and the articles that he and his father had dedicated there was no more war until the thirty fifth year of asas reign in the thirty sixth year of asas reign baasha king of israel went up against judah and fortified ramah to prevent anyone from leaving or entering the territory of asa king of judah asa then took the silver and gold out of the treasuries of the lords temple and of his own palace and sent it to ben hadad king of aram who was ruling in damascus let there be a treaty between me and you he said as there was between my father and your father see i am sending you silver and gold now break your treaty with baasha king of israel so he will withdraw from me ben hadad agreed with king asa and sent the commanders of his forces against the towns of israel they conquered ijon dan abel maim and all the store cities of naphtali when baasha heard this he stopped building ramah and abandoned his work then king asa brought all the men of judah and they carried away from ramah the stones and timber baasha had been using with them he built up geba and mizpah at that time hanani the seer came to asa king of judah and said to him because you relied on the king of aram and not on the lord your god the army of the king of aram has escaped from your hand were not the cushites and libyans a mighty army with great numbers of chariots and horsemen yet when you relied on the lord he delivered them into your hand for the eyes of the lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him you have done a foolish thing and from now on you will be at war asa was angry with the seer because of this he was so enraged that he put him in prison at the same time asa brutally oppressed some of the people the events of asas reign from beginning to end are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel in the thirty ninth year of his reign asa was afflicted with a disease in his feet though his disease was severe even in his illness he did not seek help from the lord but only from the physicians then in the forty first year of his reign asa died and rested with his fathers they buried him in the tomb that he had cut out for himself in the city of david they laid him on a bier covered with spices and various blended perfumes and they made a huge fire in his honor jehoshaphat his son succeeded him as king and strengthened himself against israel he stationed troops in all the fortified cities of judah and put garrisons in judah and in the towns of ephraim that his father asa had captured the lord was with jehoshaphat because in his early years he walked in the ways his father david had followed he did not consult the baals but sought the god of his father and followed his commands rather than the practices of israel the lord established the kingdom under his control and all judah brought gifts to jehoshaphat so that he had great wealth and honor his heart was devoted to the ways of the lord furthermore he removed the high places and the asherah poles from judah in the third year of his reign he sent his officials ben hail obadiah zechariah nethanel and micaiah to teach in the towns of judah with them were certain levites shemaiah nethaniah zebadiah asahel shemiramoth jehonathan adonijah tobijah and tob adonijah and the priests elishama and jehoram they taught throughout judah taking with them the book of the law of the lord they went around to all the towns of judah and taught the people the fear of the lord fell on all the kingdoms of the lands surrounding judah so that they did not make war with jehoshaphat some philistines brought jehoshaphat gifts and silver as tribute and the arabs brought him flocks seven thousand seven hundred rams and seven thousand seven hundred goats jehoshaphat became more and more powerful he built forts and store cities in judah and had large supplies in the towns of judah he also kept experienced fighting men in jerusalem their enrollment by families was as follows from judah commanders of units of 1000 adnah the commander with 300000 fighting men next jehohanan the commander with 280000 next amasiah son of zicri who volunteered himself for the service of the lord with 200000 from benjamin eliada a valiant soldier with 200000 men armed with bows and shields next jehozabad with 180000 men armed for battle these were the men who served the king besides those he stationed in the fortified cities throughout judah now jehoshaphat had great wealth and honor and he allied himself with ahab by marriage some years later he went down to visit ahab in samaria ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for him and the people with him and urged him to attack ramoth gilead ahab king of israel asked jehoshaphat king of judah will you go with me against ramoth gilead jehoshaphat replied i am as you are and my people as your people we will join you in the war but jehoshaphat also said to the king of israel first seek the counsel of the lord so the king of israel brought together the prophets four hundred men and asked them shall we go to war against ramoth gilead or shall i refraingo they answered for god will give it into the kings hand but jehoshaphat asked is there not a prophet of the lord here whom we can inquire of the king of israel answered jehoshaphat there is still one man through whom we can inquire of the lord but i hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me but always bad he is micaiah son of imlahthe king should not say that jehoshaphat replied so the king of israel called one of his officials and said bring micaiah son of imlah at once dressed in their royal robes the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah were sitting on their thrones at the threshing floor by the entrance to the gate of samaria with all the prophets prophesying before them now zedekiah son of kenaanah had made iron horns and he declared this is what the lord says with these you will gore the arameans until they are destroyed all the other prophets were prophesying the same thing attack ramoth gilead and be victorious they said for the lord will give it into the kings hand the messenger who had gone to summon micaiah said to him look as one man the other prophets are predicting success for the king let your word agree with theirs and speak favorably but micaiah said as surely as the lord lives i can tell him only what my god says when he arrived the king asked him micaiah shall we go to war against ramoth gilead or shall i refrainattack and be victorious he answered for they will be given into your hand the king said to him how many times must i make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the lord then micaiah answered i saw all israel scattered on the hills like sheep without a shepherd and the lord said these people have no master let each one go home in peace the king of israel said to jehoshaphat didnt i tell you that he never prophesies anything good about me but only bad micaiah continued therefore hear the word of the lord i saw the lord sitting on his throne with all the host of heaven standing on his right and on his left and the lord said who will entice ahab king of israel into attacking ramoth gilead and going to his death thereone suggested this and another that finally a spirit came forward stood before the lord and said i will entice himby what means the lord asked i will go and be a lying spirit in the mouths of all his prophets he said you will succeed in enticing him said the lord go and do it so now the lord has put a lying spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours the lord has decreed disaster for you then zedekiah son of kenaanah went up and slapped micaiah in the face which way did the spirit from the lord go when he went from me to speak to you he asked micaiah replied you will find out on the day you go to hide in an inner room the king of israel then ordered take micaiah and send him back to amon the ruler of the city and to joash the kings son and say this is what the king says put this fellow in prison and give him nothing but bread and water until i return safely micaiah declared if you ever return safely the lord has not spoken through me then he added mark my words all you people so the king of israel and jehoshaphat king of judah went up to ramoth gilead the king of israel said to jehoshaphat i will enter the battle in disguise but you wear your royal robes so the king of israel disguised himself and went into battle now the king of aram had ordered his chariot commanders do not fight with anyone small or great except the king of israel when the chariot commanders saw jehoshaphat they thought this is the king of israel so they turned to attack him but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him god drew them away from him for when the chariot commanders saw that he was not the king of israel they stopped pursuing him but someone drew his bow at random and hit the king of israel between the sections of his armor the king told the chariot driver wheel around and get me out of the fighting ive been wounded all day long the battle raged and the king of israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the arameans until evening then at sunset he died when jehoshaphat king of judah returned safely to his palace in jerusalem jehu the seer the son of hanani went out to meet him and said to the king should you help the wicked and love those who hate the lord because of this the wrath of the lord is upon you there is however some good in you for you have rid the land of the asherah poles and have set your heart on seeking god jehoshaphat lived in jerusalem and he went out again among the people from beersheba to the hill country of ephraim and turned them back to the lord the god of their fathers he appointed judges in the land in each of the fortified cities of judah he told them consider carefully what you do because you are not judging for man but for the lord who is with you whenever you give a verdict now let the fear of the lord be upon you judge carefully for with the lord our god there is no injustice or partiality or bribery in jerusalem also jehoshaphat appointed some of the levites priests and heads of israelite families to administer the law of the lord and to settle disputes and they lived in jerusalem he gave them these orders you must serve faithfully and wholeheartedly in the fear of the lord in every case that comes before you from your fellow countrymen who live in the cities whether bloodshed or other concerns of the law commands decrees or ordinances you are to warn them not to sin against the lord otherwise his wrath will come on you and your brothers do this and you will not sin amariah the chief priest will be over you in any matter concerning the lord and zebadiah son of ishmael the leader of the tribe of judah will be over you in any matter concerning the king and the levites will serve as officials before you act with courage and may the lord be with those who do well after this the moabites and ammonites with some of the meunites came to make war on jehoshaphat some men came and told jehoshaphat a vast army is coming against you from edom from the other side of the sea it is already in hazazon tamar that is en gedi alarmed jehoshaphat resolved to inquire of the lord and he proclaimed a fast for all judah the people of judah came together to seek help from the lord indeed they came from every town in judah to seek him then jehoshaphat stood up in the assembly of judah and jerusalem at the temple of the lord in the front of the new courtyard and said o lord god of our fathers are you not the god who is in heaven you rule over all the kingdoms of the nations power and might are in your hand and no one can withstand you o our god did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people israel and give it forever to the descendants of abraham your friend they have lived in it and have built in it a sanctuary for your name saying if calamity comes upon us whether the sword of judgment or plague or famine we will stand in your presence before this temple that bears your name and will cry out to you in our distress and you will hear us and save us but now here are men from ammon moab and mount seir whose territory you would not allow israel to invade when they came from egypt so they turned away from them and did not destroy them see how they are repaying us by coming to drive us out of the possession you gave us as an inheritance o our god will you not judge them for we have no power to face this vast army that is attacking us we do not know what to do but our eyes are upon you all the men of judah with their wives and children and little ones stood there before the lord then the spirit of the lord came upon jahaziel son of zechariah the son of benaiah the son of jeiel the son of mattaniah a levite and descendant of asaph as he stood in the assembly he said listen king jehoshaphat and all who live in judah and jerusalem this is what the lord says to you do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army for the battle is not yours but gods tomorrow march down against them they will be climbing up by the pass of ziz and you will find them at the end of the gorge in the desert of jeruel you will not have to fight this battle take up your positions stand firm and see the deliverance the lord will give you o judah and jerusalem do not be afraid do not be discouraged go out to face them tomorrow and the lord will be with you jehoshaphat bowed with his face to the ground and all the people of judah and jerusalem fell down in worship before the lord then some levites from the kohathites and korahites stood up and praised the lord the god of israel with very loud voice early in the morning they left for the desert of tekoa as they set out jehoshaphat stood and said listen to me judah and people of jerusalem have faith in the lord your god and you will be upheld have faith in his prophets and you will be successful after consulting the people jehoshaphat appointed men to sing to the lord and to praise him for the splendor of his holiness as they went out at the head of the army saying give thanks to the lord for his love endures forever as they began to sing and praise the lord set ambushes against the men of ammon and moab and mount seir who were invading judah and they were defeated the men of ammon and moab rose up against the men from mount seir to destroy and annihilate them after they finished slaughtering the men from seir they helped to destroy one another when the men of judah came to the place that overlooks the desert and looked toward the vast army they saw only dead bodies lying on the ground no one had escaped so jehoshaphat and his men went to carry off their plunder and they found among them a great amount of equipment and clothing and also articles of value more than they could take away there was so much plunder that it took three days to collect it on the fourth day they assembled in the valley of beracah where they praised the lord this is why it is called the valley of beracah to this day then led by jehoshaphat all the men of judah and jerusalem returned joyfully to jerusalem for the lord had given them cause to rejoice over their enemies they entered jerusalem and went to the temple of the lord with harps and lutes and trumpets the fear of god came upon all the kingdoms of the countries when they heard how the lord had fought against the enemies of israel and the kingdom of jehoshaphat was at peace for his god had given him rest on every side so jehoshaphat reigned over judah he was thirty five years old when he became king of judah and he reigned in jerusalem twenty five years his mothers name was azubah daughter of shilhi he walked in the ways of his father asa and did not stray from them he did what was right in the eyes of the lord the high places however were not removed and the people still had not set their hearts on the god of their fathers the other events of jehoshaphats reign from beginning to end are written in the annals of jehu son of hanani which are recorded in the book of the kings of israel later jehoshaphat king of judah made an alliance with ahaziah king of israel who was guilty of wickedness he agreed with him to construct a fleet of trading ships after these were built at ezion geber eliezer son of dodavahu of mareshah prophesied against jehoshaphat saying because you have made an alliance with ahaziah the lord will destroy what you have made the ships were wrecked and were not able to set sail to trade then jehoshaphat rested with his fathers and was buried with them in the city of david and jehoram his son succeeded him as king jehorams brothers the sons of jehoshaphat were azariah jehiel zechariah azariahu michael and shephatiah all these were sons of jehoshaphat king of israel their father had given them many gifts of silver and gold and articles of value as well as fortified cities in judah but he had given the kingdom to jehoram because he was his firstborn son when jehoram established himself firmly over his fathers kingdom he put all his brothers to the sword along with some of the princes of israel jehoram was thirty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eight years he walked in the ways of the kings of israel as the house of ahab had done for he married a daughter of ahab he did evil in the eyes of the lord nevertheless because of the covenant the lord had made with david the lord was not willing to destroy the house of david he had promised to maintain a lamp for him and his descendants forever in the time of jehoram edom rebelled against judah and set up its own king so jehoram went there with his officers and all his chariots the edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders but he rose up and broke through by night to this day edom has been in rebellion against judah libnah revolted at the same time because jehoram had forsaken the lord the god of his fathers he had also built high places on the hills of judah and had caused the people of jerusalem to prostitute themselves and had led judah astray jehoram received a letter from elijah the prophet which said this is what the lord the god of your father david says you have not walked in the ways of your father jehoshaphat or of asa king of judah but you have walked in the ways of the kings of israel and you have led judah and the people of jerusalem to prostitute themselves just as the house of ahab did you have also murdered your own brothers members of your fathers house men who were better than you so now the lord is about to strike your people your sons your wives and everything that is yours with a heavy blow you yourself will be very ill with a lingering disease of the bowels until the disease causes your bowels to come out the lord aroused against jehoram the hostility of the philistines and of the arabs who lived near the cushites they attacked judah invaded it and carried off all the goods found in the kings palace together with his sons and wives not a son was left to him except ahaziah the youngest after all this the lord afflicted jehoram with an incurable disease of the bowels in the course of time at the end of the second year his bowels came out because of the disease and he died in great pain his people made no fire in his honor as they had for his fathers jehoram was thirty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eight years he passed away to no ones regret and was buried in the city of david but not in the tombs of the kings the people of jerusalem made ahaziah jehorams youngest son king in his place since the raiders who came with the arabs into the camp had killed all the older sons so ahaziah son of jehoram king of judah began to reign ahaziah was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem one year his mothers name was athaliah a granddaughter of omri he too walked in the ways of the house of ahab for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong he did evil in the eyes of the lord as the house of ahab had done for after his fathers death they became his advisers to his undoing he also followed their counsel when he went with joram son of ahab king of israel to war against hazael king of aram at ramoth gilead the arameans wounded joram so he returned to jezreel to recover from the wounds they had inflicted on him at ramoth in his battle with hazael king of aram then ahaziah son of jehoram king of judah went down to jezreel to see joram son of ahab because he had been wounded through ahaziahs visit to joram god brought about ahaziahs downfall when ahaziah arrived he went out with joram to meet jehu son of nimshi whom the lord had anointed to destroy the house of ahab while jehu was executing judgment on the house of ahab he found the princes of judah and the sons of ahaziahs relatives who had been attending ahaziah and he killed them he then went in search of ahaziah and his men captured him while he was hiding in samaria he was brought to jehu and put to death they buried him for they said he was a son of jehoshaphat who sought the lord with all his heart so there was no one in the house of ahaziah powerful enough to retain the kingdom when athaliah the mother of ahaziah saw that her son was dead she proceeded to destroy the whole royal family of the house of judah but jehosheba the daughter of king jehoram took joash son of ahaziah and stole him away from among the royal princes who were about to be murdered and put him and his nurse in a bedroom because jehosheba the daughter of king jehoram and wife of the priest jehoiada was ahaziahs sister she hid the child from athaliah so she could not kill him he remained hidden with them at the temple of god for six years while athaliah ruled the land in the seventh year jehoiada showed his strength he made a covenant with the commanders of units of a hundred azariah son of jeroham ishmael son of jehohanan azariah son of obed maaseiah son of adaiah and elishaphat son of zicri they went throughout judah and gathered the levites and the heads of israelite families from all the towns when they came to jerusalem the whole assembly made a covenant with the king at the temple of god jehoiada said to them the kings son shall reign as the lord promised concerning the descendants of david now this is what you are to do a third of you priests and levites who are going on duty on the sabbath are to keep watch at the doors a third of you at the royal palace and a third at the foundation gate and all the other men are to be in the courtyards of the temple of the lord no one is to enter the temple of the lord except the priests and levites on duty they may enter because they are consecrated but all the other men are to guard what the lord has assigned to them the levites are to station themselves around the king each man with his weapons in his hand anyone who enters the temple must be put to death stay close to the king wherever he goes the levites and all the men of judah did just as jehoiada the priest ordered each one took his men those who were going on duty on the sabbath and those who were going off duty for jehoiada the priest had not released any of the divisions then he gave the commanders of units of a hundred the spears and the large and small shields that had belonged to king david and that were in the temple of god he stationed all the men each with his weapon in his hand around the king near the altar and the temple from the south side to the north side of the temple jehoiada and his sons brought out the kings son and put the crown on him they presented him with a copy of the covenant and proclaimed him king they anointed him and shouted long live the king when athaliah heard the noise of the people running and cheering the king she went to them at the temple of the lord she looked and there was the king standing by his pillar at the entrance the officers and the trumpeters were beside the king and all the people of the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets and singers with musical instruments were leading the praises then athaliah tore her robes and shouted treason treason jehoiada the priest sent out the commanders of units of a hundred who were in charge of the troops and said to them bring her out between the ranks and put to the sword anyone who follows her for the priest had said do not put her to death at the temple of the lord so they seized her as she reached the entrance of the horse gate on the palace grounds and there they put her to death jehoiada then made a covenant that he and the people and the king would be the lords people all the people went to the temple of baal and tore it down they smashed the altars and idols and killed mattan the priest of baal in front of the altars then jehoiada placed the oversight of the temple of the lord in the hands of the priests who were levites to whom david had made assignments in the temple to present the burnt offerings of the lord as written in the law of moses with rejoicing and singing as david had ordered he also stationed doorkeepers at the gates of the lords temple so that no one who was in any way unclean might enter he took with him the commanders of hundreds the nobles the rulers of the people and all the people of the land and brought the king down from the temple of the lord they went into the palace through the upper gate and seated the king on the royal throne and all the people of the land rejoiced and the city was quiet because athaliah had been slain with the sword joash was seven years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem forty years his mothers name was zibiah she was from beersheba joash did what was right in the eyes of the lord all the years of jehoiada the priest jehoiada chose two wives for him and he had sons and daughters some time later joash decided to restore the temple of the lord he called together the priests and levites and said to them go to the towns of judah and collect the money due annually from all israel to repair the temple of your god do it now but the levites did not act at once therefore the king summoned jehoiada the chief priest and said to him why havent you required the levites to bring in from judah and jerusalem the tax imposed by moses the servant of the lord and by the assembly of israel for the tent of the testimony now the sons of that wicked woman athaliah had broken into the temple of god and had used even its sacred objects for the baals at the kings command a chest was made and placed outside at the gate of the temple of the lord a proclamation was then issued in judah and jerusalem that they should bring to the lord the tax that moses the servant of god had required of israel in the desert all the officials and all the people brought their contributions gladly dropping them into the chest until it was full whenever the chest was brought in by the levites to the kings officials and they saw that there was a large amount of money the royal secretary and the officer of the chief priest would come and empty the chest and carry it back to its place they did this regularly and collected a great amount of money the king and jehoiada gave it to the men who carried out the work required for the temple of the lord they hired masons and carpenters to restore the lords temple and also workers in iron and bronze to repair the temple the men in charge of the work were diligent and the repairs progressed under them they rebuilt the temple of god according to its original design and reinforced it when they had finished they brought the rest of the money to the king and jehoiada and with it were made articles for the lords temple articles for the service and for the burnt offerings and also dishes and other objects of gold and silver as long as jehoiada lived burnt offerings were presented continually in the temple of the lord now jehoiada was old and full of years and he died at the age of a hundred and thirty he was buried with the kings in the city of david because of the good he had done in israel for god and his temple after the death of jehoiada the officials of judah came and paid homage to the king and he listened to them they abandoned the temple of the lord the god of their fathers and worshiped asherah poles and idols because of their guilt gods anger came upon judah and jerusalem although the lord sent prophets to the people to bring them back to him and though they testified against them they would not listen then the spirit of god came upon zechariah son of jehoiada the priest he stood before the people and said this is what god says why do you disobey the lords commands you will not prosper because you have forsaken the lord he has forsaken you but they plotted against him and by order of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the lords temple king joash did not remember the kindness zechariahs father jehoiada had shown him but killed his son who said as he lay dying may the lord see this and call you to account at the turn of the year the army of aram marched against joash it invaded judah and jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the people they sent all the plunder to their king in damascus although the aramean army had come with only a few men the lord delivered into their hands a much larger army because judah had forsaken the lord the god of their fathers judgment was executed on joash when the arameans withdrew they left joash severely wounded his officials conspired against him for murdering the son of jehoiada the priest and they killed him in his bed so he died and was buried in the city of david but not in the tombs of the kings those who conspired against him were zabad son of shimeath an ammonite woman and jehozabad son of shimrith a moabite woman the account of his sons the many prophecies about him and the record of the restoration of the temple of god are written in the annotations on the book of the kings and amaziah his son succeeded him as king amaziah was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem twenty nine years his mothers name was jehoaddin she was from jerusalem he did what was right in the eyes of the lord but not wholeheartedly after the kingdom was firmly in his control he executed the officials who had murdered his father the king yet he did not put their sons to death but acted in accordance with what is written in the law in the book of moses where the lord commanded fathers shall not be put to death for their children nor children put to death for their fathers each is to die for his own sins amaziah called the people of judah together and assigned them according to their families to commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds for all judah and benjamin he then mustered those twenty years old or more and found that there were three hundred thousand men ready for military service able to handle the spear and shield he also hired a hundred thousand fighting men from israel for a hundred talents of silver but a man of god came to him and said o king these troops from israel must not march with you for the lord is not with israel not with any of the people of ephraim even if you go and fight courageously in battle god will overthrow you before the enemy for god has the power to help or to overthrow amaziah asked the man of god but what about the hundred talents i paid for these israelite troops the man of god replied the lord can give you much more than that so amaziah dismissed the troops who had come to him from ephraim and sent them home they were furious with judah and left for home in a great rage amaziah then marshaled his strength and led his army to the valley of salt where he killed ten thousand men of seir the army of judah also captured ten thousand men alive took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down so that all were dashed to pieces meanwhile the troops that amaziah had sent back and had not allowed to take part in the war raided judean towns from samaria to beth horon they killed three thousand people and carried off great quantities of plunder when amaziah returned from slaughtering the edomites he brought back the gods of the people of seir he set them up as his own gods bowed down to them and burned sacrifices to them the anger of the lord burned against amaziah and he sent a prophet to him who said why do you consult this peoples gods which could not save their own people from your hand while he was still speaking the king said to him have we appointed you an adviser to the king stop why be struck down so the prophet stopped but said i know that god has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have not listened to my counsel after amaziah king of judah consulted his advisers he sent this challenge to jehoash son of jehoahaz the son of jehu king of israel come meet me face to face but jehoash king of israel replied to amaziah king of judah a thistle in lebanon sent a message to a cedar in lebanon give your daughter to my son in marriage then a wild beast in lebanon came along and trampled the thistle underfoot you say to yourself that you have defeated edom and now you are arrogant and proud but stay at home why ask for trouble and cause your own downfall and that of judah also amaziah however would not listen for god so worked that he might hand them over to jehoash because they sought the gods of edom so jehoash king of israel attacked he and amaziah king of judah faced each other at beth shemesh in judah judah was routed by israel and every man fled to his home jehoash king of israel captured amaziah king of judah the son of joash the son of ahaziah at beth shemesh then jehoash brought him to jerusalem and broke down the wall of jerusalem from the ephraim gate to the corner gate a section about six hundred feet long he took all the gold and silver and all the articles found in the temple of god that had been in the care of obed edom together with the palace treasures and the hostages and returned to samaria amaziah son of joash king of judah lived for fifteen years after the death of jehoash son of jehoahaz king of israel as for the other events of amaziahs reign from beginning to end are they not written in the book of the kings of judah and israel from the time that amaziah turned away from following the lord they conspired against him in jerusalem and he fled to lachish but they sent men after him to lachish and killed him there he was brought back by horse and was buried with his fathers in the city of judah then all the people of judah took uzziah who was sixteen years old and made him king in place of his father amaziah he was the one who rebuilt elath and restored it to judah after amaziah rested with his fathers uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem fifty two years his mothers name was jecoliah she was from jerusalem he did what was right in the eyes of the lord just as his father amaziah had done he sought god during the days of zechariah who instructed him in the fear of god as long as he sought the lord god gave him success he went to war against the philistines and broke down the walls of gath jabneh and ashdod he then rebuilt towns near ashdod and elsewhere among the philistines god helped him against the philistines and against the arabs who lived in gur baal and against the meunites the ammonites brought tribute to uzziah and his fame spread as far as the border of egypt because he had become very powerful uzziah built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate at the valley gate and at the angle of the wall and he fortified them he also built towers in the desert and dug many cisterns because he had much livestock in the foothills and in the plain he had people working his fields and vineyards in the hills and in the fertile lands for he loved the soil uzziah had a well trained army ready to go out by divisions according to their numbers as mustered by jeiel the secretary and maaseiah the officer under the direction of hananiah one of the royal officials the total number of family leaders over the fighting men was 2600 under their command was an army of 307500 men trained for war a powerful force to support the king against his enemies uzziah provided shields spears helmets coats of armor bows and slingstones for the entire army in jerusalem he made machines designed by skillful men for use on the towers and on the corner defenses to shoot arrows and hurl large stones his fame spread far and wide for he was greatly helped until he became powerful but after uzziah became powerful his pride led to his downfall he was unfaithful to the lord his god and entered the temple of the lord to burn incense on the altar of incense azariah the priest with eighty other courageous priests of the lord followed him in they confronted him and said it is not right for you uzziah to burn incense to the lord that is for the priests the descendants of aaron who have been consecrated to burn incense leave the sanctuary for you have been unfaithful and you will not be honored by the lord god uzziah who had a censer in his hand ready to burn incense became angry while he was raging at the priests in their presence before the incense altar in the lords temple leprosy broke out on his forehead when azariah the chief priest and all the other priests looked at him they saw that he had leprosy on his forehead so they hurried him out indeed he himself was eager to leave because the lord had afflicted him king uzziah had leprosy until the day he died he lived in a separate house leprous and excluded from the temple of the lord jotham his son had charge of the palace and governed the people of the land the other events of uzziahs reign from beginning to end are recorded by the prophet isaiah son of amoz uzziah rested with his fathers and was buried near them in a field for burial that belonged to the kings for people said he had leprosy and jotham his son succeeded him as king jotham was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem sixteen years his mothers name was jerusha daughter of zadok he did what was right in the eyes of the lord just as his father uzziah had done but unlike him he did not enter the temple of the lord the people however continued their corrupt practices jotham rebuilt the upper gate of the temple of the lord and did extensive work on the wall at the hill of ophel he built towns in the judean hills and forts and towers in the wooded areas jotham made war on the king of the ammonites and conquered them that year the ammonites paid him a hundred talents of silver ten thousand cors of wheat and ten thousand cors of barley the ammonites brought him the same amount also in the second and third years jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the lord his god the other events in jothams reign including all his wars and the other things he did are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah he was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem sixteen years jotham rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of david and ahaz his son succeeded him as king ahaz was twenty years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem sixteen years unlike david his father he did not do what was right in the eyes of the lord he walked in the ways of the kings of israel and also made cast idols for worshiping the baals he burned sacrifices in the valley of ben hinnom and sacrificed his sons in the fire following the detestable ways of the nations the lord had driven out before the israelites he offered sacrifices and burned incense at the high places on the hilltops and under every spreading tree therefore the lord his god handed him over to the king of aram the arameans defeated him and took many of his people as prisoners and brought them to damascus he was also given into the hands of the king of israel who inflicted heavy casualties on him in one day pekah son of remaliah killed a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers in judah because judah had forsaken the lord the god of their fathers zicri an ephraimite warrior killed maaseiah the kings son azrikam the officer in charge of the palace and elkanah second to the king the israelites took captive from their kinsmen two hundred thousand wives sons and daughters they also took a great deal of plunder which they carried back to samaria but a prophet of the lord named oded was there and he went out to meet the army when it returned to samaria he said to them because the lord the god of your fathers was angry with judah he gave them into your hand but you have slaughtered them in a rage that reaches to heaven and now you intend to make the men and women of judah and jerusalem your slaves but arent you also guilty of sins against the lord your god now listen to me send back your fellow countrymen you have taken as prisoners for the lords fierce anger rests on you then some of the leaders in ephraim azariah son of jehohanan berekiah son of meshillemoth jehizkiah son of shallum and amasa son of hadlai confronted those who were arriving from the war you must not bring those prisoners here they said or we will be guilty before the lord do you intend to add to our sin and guilt for our guilt is already great and his fierce anger rests on israel so the soldiers gave up the prisoners and plunder in the presence of the officials and all the assembly the men designated by name took the prisoners and from the plunder they clothed all who were naked they provided them with clothes and sandals food and drink and healing balm all those who were weak they put on donkeys so they took them back to their fellow countrymen at jericho the city of palms and returned to samaria at that time king ahaz sent to the king of assyria for help the edomites had again come and attacked judah and carried away prisoners while the philistines had raided towns in the foothills and in the negev of judah they captured and occupied beth shemesh aijalon and gederoth as well as soco timnah and gimzo with their surrounding villages the lord had humbled judah because of ahaz king of israel for he had promoted wickedness in judah and had been most unfaithful to the lord tiglath pileser king of assyria came to him but he gave him trouble instead of help ahaz took some of the things from the temple of the lord and from the royal palace and from the princes and presented them to the king of assyria but that did not help him in his time of trouble king ahaz became even more unfaithful to the lord he offered sacrifices to the gods of damascus who had defeated him for he thought since the gods of the kings of aram have helped them i will sacrifice to them so they will help me but they were his downfall and the downfall of all israel ahaz gathered together the furnishings from the temple of god and took them away he shut the doors of the lords temple and set up altars at every street corner in jerusalem in every town in judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods and provoked the lord the god of his fathers to anger the other events of his reign and all his ways from beginning to end are written in the book of the kings of judah and israel ahaz rested with his fathers and was buried in the city of jerusalem but he was not placed in the tombs of the kings of israel and hezekiah his son succeeded him as king hezekiah was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem twenty nine years his mothers name was abijah daughter of zechariah he did what was right in the eyes of the lord just as his father david had done in the first month of the first year of his reign he opened the doors of the temple of the lord and repaired them he brought in the priests and the levites assembled them in the square on the east side and said listen to me levites consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the lord the god of your fathers remove all defilement from the sanctuary our fathers were unfaithful they did evil in the eyes of the lord our god and forsook him they turned their faces away from the lords dwelling place and turned their backs on him they also shut the doors of the portico and put out the lamps they did not burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the god of israel therefore the anger of the lord has fallen on judah and jerusalem he has made them an object of dread and horror and scorn as you can see with your own eyes this is why our fathers have fallen by the sword and why our sons and daughters and our wives are in captivity now i intend to make a covenant with the lord the god of israel so that his fierce anger will turn away from us my sons do not be negligent now for the lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him to minister before him and to burn incense then these levites set to work from the kohathites mahath son of amasai and joel son of azariah from the merarites kish son of abdi and azariah son of jehallelel from the gershonites joah son of zimmah and eden son of joah from the descendants of elizaphan shimri and jeiel from the descendants of asaph zechariah and mattaniah from the descendants of heman jehiel and shimei from the descendants of jeduthun shemaiah and uzziel when they had assembled their brothers and consecrated themselves they went in to purify the temple of the lord as the king had ordered following the word of the lord the priests went into the sanctuary of the lord to purify it they brought out to the courtyard of the lords temple everything unclean that they found in the temple of the lord the levites took it and carried it out to the kidron valley they began the consecration on the first day of the first month and by the eighth day of the month they reached the portico of the lord for eight more days they consecrated the temple of the lord itself finishing on the sixteenth day of the first month then they went in to king hezekiah and reported we have purified the entire temple of the lord the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils and the table for setting out the consecrated bread with all its articles we have prepared and consecrated all the articles that king ahaz removed in his unfaithfulness while he was king they are now in front of the lords altar early the next morning king hezekiah gathered the city officials together and went up to the temple of the lord they brought seven bulls seven rams seven male lambs and seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom for the sanctuary and for judah the king commanded the priests the descendants of aaron to offer these on the altar of the lord so they slaughtered the bulls and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar next they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar then they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled their blood on the altar the goats for the sin offering were brought before the king and the assembly and they laid their hands on them the priests then slaughtered the goats and presented their blood on the altar for a sin offering to atone for all israel because the king had ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all israel he stationed the levites in the temple of the lord with cymbals harps and lyres in the way prescribed by david and gad the kings seer and nathan the prophet this was commanded by the lord through his prophets so the levites stood ready with davids instruments and the priests with their trumpets hezekiah gave the order to sacrifice the burnt offering on the altar as the offering began singing to the lord began also accompanied by trumpets and the instruments of david king of israel the whole assembly bowed in worship while the singers sang and the trumpeters played all this continued until the sacrifice of the burnt offering was completed when the offerings were finished the king and everyone present with him knelt down and worshiped king hezekiah and his officials ordered the levites to praise the lord with the words of david and of asaph the seer so they sang praises with gladness and bowed their heads and worshiped then hezekiah said you have now dedicated yourselves to the lord come and bring sacrifices and thank offerings to the temple of the lord so the assembly brought sacrifices and thank offerings and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings the number of burnt offerings the assembly brought was seventy bulls a hundred rams and two hundred male lambs all of them for burnt offerings to the lord the animals consecrated as sacrifices amounted to six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep and goats the priests however were too few to skin all the burnt offerings so their kinsmen the levites helped them until the task was finished and until other priests had been consecrated for the levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than the priests had been there were burnt offerings in abundance together with the fat of the fellowship offerings and the drink offerings that accompanied the burnt offerings so the service of the temple of the lord was reestablished hezekiah and all the people rejoiced at what god had brought about for his people because it was done so quickly hezekiah sent word to all israel and judah and also wrote letters to ephraim and manasseh inviting them to come to the temple of the lord in jerusalem and celebrate the passover to the lord the god of israel the king and his officials and the whole assembly in jerusalem decided to celebrate the passover in the second month they had not been able to celebrate it at the regular time because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not assembled in jerusalem the plan seemed right both to the king and to the whole assembly they decided to send a proclamation throughout israel from beersheba to dan calling the people to come to jerusalem and celebrate the passover to the lord the god of israel it had not been celebrated in large numbers according to what was written at the kings command couriers went throughout israel and judah with letters from the king and from his officials which read people of israel return to the lord the god of abraham isaac and israel that he may return to you who are left who have escaped from the hand of the kings of assyria do not be like your fathers and brothers who were unfaithful to the lord the god of their fathers so that he made them an object of horror as you see do not be stiff necked as your fathers were submit to the lord come to the sanctuary which he has consecrated forever serve the lord your god so that his fierce anger will turn away from you if you return to the lord then your brothers and your children will be shown compassion by their captors and will come back to this land for the lord your god is gracious and compassionate he will not turn his face from you if you return to him the couriers went from town to town in ephraim and manasseh as far as zebulun but the people scorned and ridiculed them nevertheless some men of asher manasseh and zebulun humbled themselves and went to jerusalem also in judah the hand of god was on the people to give them unity of mind to carry out what the king and his officials had ordered following the word of the lord a very large crowd of people assembled in jerusalem to celebrate the feast of unleavened bread in the second month they removed the altars in jerusalem and cleared away the incense altars and threw them into the kidron valley they slaughtered the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month the priests and the levites were ashamed and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the temple of the lord then they took up their regular positions as prescribed in the law of moses the man of god the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them by the levites since many in the crowd had not consecrated themselves the levites had to kill the passover lambs for all those who were not ceremonially clean and could not consecrate their lambs to the lord although most of the many people who came from ephraim manasseh issachar and zebulun had not purified themselves yet they ate the passover contrary to what was written but hezekiah prayed for them saying may the lord who is good pardon everyone who sets his heart on seeking god the lord the god of his fathers even if he is not clean according to the rules of the sanctuary and the lord heard hezekiah and healed the people the israelites who were present in jerusalem celebrated the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with great rejoicing while the levites and priests sang to the lord every day accompanied by the lords instruments of praise hezekiah spoke encouragingly to all the levites who showed good understanding of the service of the lord for the seven days they ate their assigned portion and offered fellowship offerings and praised the lord the god of their fathers the whole assembly then agreed to celebrate the festival seven more days so for another seven days they celebrated joyfully hezekiah king of judah provided a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep and goats for the assembly and the officials provided them with a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep and goats a great number of priests consecrated themselves the entire assembly of judah rejoiced along with the priests and levites and all who had assembled from israel including the aliens who had come from israel and those who lived in judah there was great joy in jerusalem for since the days of solomon son of david king of israel there had been nothing like this in jerusalem the priests and the levites stood to bless the people and god heard them for their prayer reached heaven his holy dwelling place when all this had ended the israelites who were there went out to the towns of judah smashed the sacred stones and cut down the asherah poles they destroyed the high places and the altars throughout judah and benjamin and in ephraim and manasseh after they had destroyed all of them the israelites returned to their own towns and to their own property hezekiah assigned the priests and levites to divisions each of them according to their duties as priests or levites to offer burnt offerings and fellowship offerings to minister to give thanks and to sing praises at the gates of the lords dwelling the king contributed from his own possessions for the morning and evening burnt offerings and for the burnt offerings on the sabbaths new moons and appointed feasts as written in the law of the lord he ordered the people living in jerusalem to give the portion due the priests and levites so they could devote themselves to the law of the lord as soon as the order went out the israelites generously gave the firstfruits of their grain new wine oil and honey and all that the fields produced they brought a great amount a tithe of everything the men of israel and judah who lived in the towns of judah also brought a tithe of their herds and flocks and a tithe of the holy things dedicated to the lord their god and they piled them in heaps they began doing this in the third month and finished in the seventh month when hezekiah and his officials came and saw the heaps they praised the lord and blessed his people israel hezekiah asked the priests and levites about the heaps and azariah the chief priest from the family of zadok answered since the people began to bring their contributions to the temple of the lord we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare because the lord has blessed his people and this great amount is left over hezekiah gave orders to prepare storerooms in the temple of the lord and this was done then they faithfully brought in the contributions tithes and dedicated gifts conaniah a levite was in charge of these things and his brother shimei was next in rank jehiel azaziah nahath asahel jerimoth jozabad eliel ismakiah mahath and benaiah were supervisors under conaniah and shimei his brother by appointment of king hezekiah and azariah the official in charge of the temple of god kore son of imnah the levite keeper of the east gate was in charge of the freewill offerings given to god distributing the contributions made to the lord and also the consecrated gifts eden miniamin jeshua shemaiah amariah and shecaniah assisted him faithfully in the towns of the priests distributing to their fellow priests according to their divisions old and young alike in addition they distributed to the males three years old or more whose names were in the genealogical records all who would enter the temple of the lord to perform the daily duties of their various tasks according to their responsibilities and their divisions and they distributed to the priests enrolled by their families in the genealogical records and likewise to the levites twenty years old or more according to their responsibilities and their divisions they included all the little ones the wives and the sons and daughters of the whole community listed in these genealogical records for they were faithful in consecrating themselves as for the priests the descendants of aaron who lived on the farm lands around their towns or in any other towns men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among them and to all who were recorded in the genealogies of the levites this is what hezekiah did throughout judah doing what was good and right and faithful before the lord his god in everything that he undertook in the service of gods temple and in obedience to the law and the commands he sought his god and worked wholeheartedly and so he prospered after all that hezekiah had so faithfully done sennacherib king of assyria came and invaded judah he laid siege to the fortified cities thinking to conquer them for himself when hezekiah saw that sennacherib had come and that he intended to make war on jerusalem he consulted with his officials and military staff about blocking off the water from the springs outside the city and they helped him a large force of men assembled and they blocked all the springs and the stream that flowed through the land why should the kings of assyria come and find plenty of water they said then he worked hard repairing all the broken sections of the wall and building towers on it he built another wall outside that one and reinforced the supporting terraces of the city of david he also made large numbers of weapons and shields he appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate and encouraged them with these words be strong and courageous do not be afraid or discouraged because of the king of assyria and the vast army with him for there is a greater power with us than with him with him is only the arm of flesh but with us is the lord our god to help us and to fight our battles and the people gained confidence from what hezekiah the king of judah said later when sennacherib king of assyria and all his forces were laying siege to lachish he sent his officers to jerusalem with this message for hezekiah king of judah and for all the people of judah who were there this is what sennacherib king of assyria says on what are you basing your confidence that you remain in jerusalem under siege when hezekiah says the lord our god will save us from the hand of the king of assyria he is misleading you to let you die of hunger and thirst did not hezekiah himself remove this gods high places and altars saying to judah and jerusalem you must worship before one altar and burn sacrifices on it do you not know what i and my fathers have done to all the peoples of the other lands were the gods of those nations ever able to deliver their land from my hand who of all the gods of these nations that my fathers destroyed has been able to save his people from me how then can your god deliver you from my hand now do not let hezekiah deceive you and mislead you like this do not believe him for no god of any nation or kingdom has been able to deliver his people from my hand or the hand of my fathers how much less will your god deliver you from my hand sennacheribs officers spoke further against the lord god and against his servant hezekiah the king also wrote letters insulting the lord the god of israel and saying this against him just as the gods of the peoples of the other lands did not rescue their people from my hand so the god of hezekiah will not rescue his people from my hand then they called out in hebrew to the people of jerusalem who were on the wall to terrify them and make them afraid in order to capture the city they spoke about the god of jerusalem as they did about the gods of the other peoples of the world the work of mens hands king hezekiah and the prophet isaiah son of amoz cried out in prayer to heaven about this and the lord sent an angel who annihilated all the fighting men and the leaders and officers in the camp of the assyrian king so he withdrew to his own land in disgrace and when he went into the temple of his god some of his sons cut him down with the sword so the lord saved hezekiah and the people of jerusalem from the hand of sennacherib king of assyria and from the hand of all others he took care of them on every side many brought offerings to jerusalem for the lord and valuable gifts for hezekiah king of judah from then on he was highly regarded by all the nations in those days hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death he prayed to the lord who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign but hezekiahs heart was proud and he did not respond to the kindness shown him therefore the lords wrath was on him and on judah and jerusalem then hezekiah repented of the pride of his heart as did the people of jerusalem therefore the lords wrath did not come upon them during the days of hezekiah hezekiah had very great riches and honor and he made treasuries for his silver and gold and for his precious stones spices shields and all kinds of valuables he also made buildings to store the harvest of grain new wine and oil and he made stalls for various kinds of cattle and pens for the flocks he built villages and acquired great numbers of flocks and herds for god had given him very great riches it was hezekiah who blocked the upper outlet of the gihon spring and channeled the water down to the west side of the city of david he succeeded in everything he undertook but when envoys were sent by the rulers of babylon to ask him about the miraculous sign that had occurred in the land god left him to test him and to know everything that was in his heart the other events of hezekiahs reign and his acts of devotion are written in the vision of the prophet isaiah son of amoz in the book of the kings of judah and israel hezekiah rested with his fathers and was buried on the hill where the tombs of davids descendants are all judah and the people of jerusalem honored him when he died and manasseh his son succeeded him as king manasseh was twelve years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem fifty five years he did evil in the eyes of the lord following the detestable practices of the nations the lord had driven out before the israelites he rebuilt the high places his father hezekiah had demolished he also erected altars to the baals and made asherah poles he bowed down to all the starry hosts and worshiped them he built altars in the temple of the lord of which the lord had said my name will remain in jerusalem forever in both courts of the temple of the lord he built altars to all the starry hosts he sacrificed his sons in the fire in the valley of ben hinnom practiced sorcery divination and witchcraft and consulted mediums and spiritists he did much evil in the eyes of the lord provoking him to anger he took the carved image he had made and put it in gods temple of which god had said to david and to his son solomon in this temple and in jerusalem which i have chosen out of all the tribes of israel i will put my name forever i will not again make the feet of the israelites leave the land i assigned to your forefathers if only they will be careful to do everything i commanded them concerning all the laws decrees and ordinances given through moses but manasseh led judah and the people of jerusalem astray so that they did more evil than the nations the lord had destroyed before the israelites the lord spoke to manasseh and his people but they paid no attention so the lord brought against them the army commanders of the king of assyria who took manasseh prisoner put a hook in his nose bound him with bronze shackles and took him to babylon in his distress he sought the favor of the lord his god and humbled himself greatly before the god of his fathers and when he prayed to him the lord was moved by his entreaty and listened to his plea so he brought him back to jerusalem and to his kingdom then manasseh knew that the lord is god afterward he rebuilt the outer wall of the city of david west of the gihon spring in the valley as far as the entrance of the fish gate and encircling the hill of ophel he also made it much higher he stationed military commanders in all the fortified cities in judah he got rid of the foreign gods and removed the image from the temple of the lord as well as all the altars he had built on the temple hill and in jerusalem and he threw them out of the city then he restored the altar of the lord and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it and told judah to serve the lord the god of israel the people however continued to sacrifice at the high places but only to the lord their god the other events of manassehs reign including his prayer to his god and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the lord the god of israel are written in the annals of the kings of israel his prayer and how god was moved by his entreaty as well as all his sins and unfaithfulness and the sites where he built high places and set up asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself all are written in the records of the seers manasseh rested with his fathers and was buried in his palace and amon his son succeeded him as king amon was twenty two years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem two years he did evil in the eyes of the lord as his father manasseh had done amon worshiped and offered sacrifices to all the idols manasseh had made but unlike his father manasseh he did not humble himself before the lord amon increased his guilt amons officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace then the people of the land killed all who had plotted against king amon and they made josiah his son king in his place josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem thirty one years he did what was right in the eyes of the lord and walked in the ways of his father david not turning aside to the right or to the left in the eighth year of his reign while he was still young he began to seek the god of his father david in his twelfth year he began to purge judah and jerusalem of high places asherah poles carved idols and cast images under his direction the altars of the baals were torn down he cut to pieces the incense altars that were above them and smashed the asherah poles the idols and the images these he broke to pieces and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them he burned the bones of the priests on their altars and so he purged judah and jerusalem in the towns of manasseh ephraim and simeon as far as naphtali and in the ruins around them he tore down the altars and the asherah poles and crushed the idols to powder and cut to pieces all the incense altars throughout israel then he went back to jerusalem in the eighteenth year of josiahs reign to purify the land and the temple he sent shaphan son of azaliah and maaseiah the ruler of the city with joah son of joahaz the recorder to repair the temple of the lord his god they went to hilkiah the high priest and gave him the money that had been brought into the temple of god which the levites who were the doorkeepers had collected from the people of manasseh ephraim and the entire remnant of israel and from all the people of judah and benjamin and the inhabitants of jerusalem then they entrusted it to the men appointed to supervise the work on the lords temple these men paid the workers who repaired and restored the temple they also gave money to the carpenters and builders to purchase dressed stone and timber for joists and beams for the buildings that the kings of judah had allowed to fall into ruin the men did the work faithfully over them to direct them were jahath and obadiah levites descended from merari and zechariah and meshullam descended from kohath the levites all who were skilled in playing musical instruments had charge of the laborers and supervised all the workers from job to job some of the levites were secretaries scribes and doorkeepers while they were bringing out the money that had been taken into the temple of the lord hilkiah the priest found the book of the law of the lord that had been given through moses hilkiah said to shaphan the secretary i have found the book of the law in the temple of the lord he gave it to shaphan then shaphan took the book to the king and reported to him your officials are doing everything that has been committed to them they have paid out the money that was in the temple of the lord and have entrusted it to the supervisors and workers then shaphan the secretary informed the king hilkiah the priest has given me a book and shaphan read from it in the presence of the king when the king heard the words of the law he tore his robes he gave these orders to hilkiah ahikam son of shaphan abdon son of micah shaphan the secretary and asaiah the kings attendant go and inquire of the lord for me and for the remnant in israel and judah about what is written in this book that has been found great is the lords anger that is poured out on us because our fathers have not kept the word of the lord they have not acted in accordance with all that is written in this book hilkiah and those the king had sent with him went to speak to the prophetess huldah who was the wife of shallum son of tokhath the son of hasrah keeper of the wardrobe she lived in jerusalem in the second district she said to them this is what the lord the god of israel says tell the man who sent you to me this is what the lord says i am going to bring disaster on this place and its people all the curses written in the book that has been read in the presence of the king of judah because they have forsaken me and burned incense to other gods and provoked me to anger by all that their hands have made my anger will be poured out on this place and will not be quenched tell the king of judah who sent you to inquire of the lord this is what the lord the god of israel says concerning the words you heard because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before god when you heard what he spoke against this place and its people and because you humbled yourself before me and tore your robes and wept in my presence i have heard you declares the lord now i will gather you to your fathers and you will be buried in peace your eyes will not see all the disaster i am going to bring on this place and on those who live here so they took her answer back to the king then the king called together all the elders of judah and jerusalem he went up to the temple of the lord with the men of judah the people of jerusalem the priests and the levites all the people from the least to the greatest he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the temple of the lord the king stood by his pillar and renewed the covenant in the presence of the lord to follow the lord and keep his commands regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his soul and to obey the words of the covenant written in this book then he had everyone in jerusalem and benjamin pledge themselves to it the people of jerusalem did this in accordance with the covenant of god the god of their fathers josiah removed all the detestable idols from all the territory belonging to the israelites and he had all who were present in israel serve the lord their god as long as he lived they did not fail to follow the lord the god of their fathers josiah celebrated the passover to the lord in jerusalem and the passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month he appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them in the service of the lords temple he said to the levites who instructed all israel and who had been consecrated to the lord put the sacred ark in the temple that solomon son of david king of israel built it is not to be carried about on your shoulders now serve the lord your god and his people israel prepare yourselves by families in your divisions according to the directions written by david king of israel and by his son solomon stand in the holy place with a group of levites for each subdivision of the families of your fellow countrymen the lay people slaughter the passover lambs consecrate yourselves and prepare the lambs for your fellow countrymen doing what the lord commanded through moses josiah provided for all the lay people who were there a total of thirty thousand sheep and goats for the passover offerings and also three thousand cattle all from the kings own possessions his officials also contributed voluntarily to the people and the priests and levites hilkiah zechariah and jehiel the administrators of gods temple gave the priests twenty six hundred passover offerings and three hundred cattle also conaniah along with shemaiah and nethanel his brothers and hashabiah jeiel and jozabad the leaders of the levites provided five thousand passover offerings and five hundred head of cattle for the levites the service was arranged and the priests stood in their places with the levites in their divisions as the king had ordered the passover lambs were slaughtered and the priests sprinkled the blood handed to them while the levites skinned the animals they set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the subdivisions of the families of the people to offer to the lord as is written in the book of moses they did the same with the cattle they roasted the passover animals over the fire as prescribed and boiled the holy offerings in pots caldrons and pans and served them quickly to all the people after this they made preparations for themselves and for the priests because the priests the descendants of aaron were sacrificing the burnt offerings and the fat portions until nightfall so the levites made preparations for themselves and for the aaronic priests the musicians the descendants of asaph were in the places prescribed by david asaph heman and jeduthun the kings seer the gatekeepers at each gate did not need to leave their posts because their fellow levites made the preparations for them so at that time the entire service of the lord was carried out for the celebration of the passover and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar of the lord as king josiah had ordered the israelites who were present celebrated the passover at that time and observed the feast of unleavened bread for seven days the passover had not been observed like this in israel since the days of the prophet samuel and none of the kings of israel had ever celebrated such a passover as did josiah with the priests the levites and all judah and israel who were there with the people of jerusalem this passover was celebrated in the eighteenth year of josiahs reign after all this when josiah had set the temple in order neco king of egypt went up to fight at carchemish on the euphrates and josiah marched out to meet him in battle but neco sent messengers to him saying what quarrel is there between you and me o king of judah it is not you i am attacking at this time but the house with which i am at war god has told me to hurry so stop opposing god who is with me or he will destroy you josiah however would not turn away from him but disguised himself to engage him in battle he would not listen to what neco had said at gods command but went to fight him on the plain of megiddo archers shot king josiah and he told his officers take me away i am badly wounded so they took him out of his chariot put him in the other chariot he had and brought him to jerusalem where he died he was buried in the tombs of his fathers and all judah and jerusalem mourned for him jeremiah composed laments for josiah and to this day all the men and women singers commemorate josiah in the laments these became a tradition in israel and are written in the laments the other events of josiahs reign and his acts of devotion according to what is written in the law of the lord all the events from beginning to end are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and the people of the land took jehoahaz son of josiah and made him king in jerusalem in place of his father jehoahaz was twenty three years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem three months the king of egypt dethroned him in jerusalem and imposed on judah a levy of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold the king of egypt made eliakim a brother of jehoahaz king over judah and jerusalem and changed eliakims name to jehoiakim but neco took eliakims brother jehoahaz and carried him off to egypt jehoiakim was twenty five years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eleven years he did evil in the eyes of the lord his god nebuchadnezzar king of babylon attacked him and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to babylon nebuchadnezzar also took to babylon articles from the temple of the lord and put them in his temple there the other events of jehoiakims reign the detestable things he did and all that was found against him are written in the book of the kings of israel and judah and jehoiachin his son succeeded him as king jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem three months and ten days he did evil in the eyes of the lord in the spring king nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to babylon together with articles of value from the temple of the lord and he made jehoiachins uncle zedekiah king over judah and jerusalem zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eleven years he did evil in the eyes of the lord his god and did not humble himself before jeremiah the prophet who spoke the word of the lord he also rebelled against king nebuchadnezzar who had made him take an oath in gods name he became stiff necked and hardened his heart and would not turn to the lord the god of israel furthermore all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful following all the detestable practices of the nations and defiling the temple of the lord which he had consecrated in jerusalem the lord the god of their fathers sent word to them through his messengers again and again because he had pity on his people and on his dwelling place but they mocked gods messengers despised his words and scoffed at his prophets until the wrath of the lord was aroused against his people and there was no remedy he brought up against them the king of the babylonians who killed their young men with the sword in the sanctuary and spared neither young man nor young woman old man or aged god handed all of them over to nebuchadnezzar he carried to babylon all the articles from the temple of god both large and small and the treasures of the lords temple and the treasures of the king and his officials they set fire to gods temple and broke down the wall of jerusalem they burned all the palaces and destroyed everything of value there he carried into exile to babylon the remnant who escaped from the sword and they became servants to him and his sons until the kingdom of persia came to power the land enjoyed its sabbath rests all the time of its desolation it rested until the seventy years were completed in fulfillment of the word of the lord spoken by jeremiah in the first year of cyrus king of persia in order to fulfill the word of the lord spoken by jeremiah the lord moved the heart of cyrus king of persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing this is what cyrus king of persia says the lord the god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at jerusalem in judah anyone of his people among you may the lord his god be with him and let him go up  in the first year of cyrus king of persia in order to fulfill the word of the lord spoken by jeremiah the lord moved the heart of cyrus king of persia to make a proclamation throughout his realm and to put it in writing this is what cyrus king of persia says the lord the god of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth and he has appointed me to build a temple for him at jerusalem in judah anyone of his people among you may his god be with him and let him go up to jerusalem in judah and build the temple of the lord the god of israel the god who is in jerusalem and the people of any place where survivors may now be living are to provide him with silver and gold with goods and livestock and with freewill offerings for the temple of god in jerusalem then the family heads of judah and benjamin and the priests and levites everyone whose heart god had moved prepared to go up and build the house of the lord in jerusalem all their neighbors assisted them with articles of silver and gold with goods and livestock and with valuable gifts in addition to all the freewill offerings moreover king cyrus brought out the articles

and so were excluded from the priesthood as unclean the governor ordered them not to eat any of the most sacred food until there was a priest ministering with the urim and thummim the whole company numbered 42360 besides their 7337 menservants and maidservants and they also had 200 men and women singers they had 736 horses 245 mules 435 camels and 6720 donkeys when they arrived at the house of

61000 drachmas of gold 5000 minas of silver and 100 priestly garments the priests the levites the singers the gatekeepers and the temple servants settled in their own towns along with some of the other people and the rest of the israelites settled in their towns when the seventh month came and the israelites had settled in their towns the people assembled as one man in jerusalem then jeshua son of jozadak and his fellow priests and zerubbabel son of shealtiel and his associates began to build the altar of the god of israel to sacrifice burnt offerings on it in accordance with what is written in the law of moses the man of god despite their fear of the peoples around them they built the altar on its foundation and sacrificed burnt offerings on it to the lord both the morning and

regular burnt offerings the new moon sacrifices and the sacrifices for all the appointed sacred feasts of the lord as well as those brought as freewill offerings to the lord on the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the lord though the foundation of the lords temple had not yet been laid then they gave money to the masons and carpenters and gave food and drink

arrival at the house of god in jerusalem zerubbabel son of shealtiel jeshua son of jozadak and the rest of their brothers the priests and the levites and all who had returned from the captivity to jerusalem began the work appointing levites twenty years of age and older to supervise the building of the house of the lord jeshua and his sons and brothers and kadmiel and his sons descendants of hodaviah  and the sons of henadad and their sons and brothers all levites joined together in supervising those working on the house of god when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the lord the priests in their vestments and with trumpets and the levites the sons of asaph with cymbals took their places to praise the lord as prescribed by david king of israel with praise and thanksgiving they sang to the lord he is good his love to israel endures forever and all the people gave a great shout of praise to the lord because the foundation of the house of the lord was laid but many of the older priests and levites and family heads who had seen the former temple wept aloud when they saw the foundation of this temple being laid while many others shouted for joy no one could distinguish the sound of the shouts of joy from the sound of weeping because the people made so much noise and the sound was heard far away when the enemies of judah and benjamin heard that the exiles were building a temple for the lord the god of israel they came to zerubbabel and to the heads of the families and said let us help you build because like you we seek your god and have been sacrificing to him since the time of esarhaddon king of assyria who brought us here but zerubbabel jeshua and the rest of the heads of the families of israel answered you have no part with us in building a temple to our god we alone will build it for the lord the god of israel as king cyrus the king of persia commanded us then the peoples around them set out to discourage the people of judah and make them afraid to go on building they hired counselors to work against them and frustrate their plans during the entire reign of cyrus king of persia and down to the reign of darius king of persia at the beginning of the reign of xerxes they lodged an accusation against the people of judah and jerusalem and in the days of artaxerxes king of persia bishlam mithredath tabeel and the rest of his associates wrote a letter to artaxerxes the letter was written in aramaic script and in the aramaic language rehum the commanding officer and shimshai the secretary wrote a letter against jerusalem to artaxerxes the king as follows rehum the commanding officer and shimshai the secretary together with the rest of their associates the judges and officials over the men from tripolis persia erech and babylon the elamites of susa and the other people whom the great and honorable ashurbanipal deported and settled in the city of samaria and elsewhere in trans euphrates this is a copy of the letter they sent him to king artaxerxes from your servants the men of trans euphrates the king should know that the jews who came up to us from you have gone to jerusalem and are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city they are restoring the walls and repairing the foundations furthermore the king should know that if this city is built and its walls are restored no more taxes tribute or duty will be paid and the royal revenues will suffer now since we are under obligation to the palace and it is not proper for us to see the king dishonored we are sending this message to inform the king so that a search may be made in the archives of your predecessors in these records you will find that this city is a rebellious city troublesome to kings and provinces a place of rebellion from ancient times that is why this city was destroyed we inform the king that if this city is built and its walls are restored you will be left with nothing in trans euphrates the king sent this reply to rehum the commanding officer shimshai the secretary and the rest of their associates living in samaria and elsewhere in trans euphrates greetings the letter you sent us has been read and translated in my presence i issued an order and a search was made and it was found that this city has a long history of revolt against kings and has been a place of rebellion and sedition jerusalem has had powerful kings ruling over the whole of trans euphrates and taxes tribute and duty were paid to them now issue an order to these men to stop work so that this city will not be rebuilt until i so order be careful not to neglect this matter why let this threat grow to the detriment of the royal interests as soon as the copy of the letter of king artaxerxes was read to rehum and shimshai the secretary and their associates they went immediately to the jews in jerusalem and compelled them by force to stop thus the work on the house of god in jerusalem came to a standstill until the second year of the reign of darius king of persia now haggai the prophet and zechariah the prophet a descendant of iddo prophesied to the jews in judah and jerusalem in the name of the god of israel who was over them then zerubbabel son of shealtiel and jeshua son of jozadak set to work to rebuild the house of god in jerusalem and the prophets of god were with them helping them at that time tattenai governor of trans euphrates and shethar bozenai and their associates went to them and asked who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure they also asked what are the names of the men constructing this building but the eye of their god was watching over the elders of the jews and they were not stopped until a report could go to darius and his written reply be received this is a copy of the letter that tattenai governor of trans euphrates and shethar bozenai and their associates the officials of trans euphrates sent to king darius the report they sent him read as follows to king darius cordial greetings the king should know that we went to the district of judah to the temple of the great god the people are building it with large stones and placing the timbers in the walls the work is being carried on with diligence and is making rapid progress under their direction we questioned the elders and asked them who authorized you to rebuild this temple and restore this structure we also asked them their names so that we could write down the names of their leaders for your information this is the answer they gave us we are the servants of the god of heaven and earth and we are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago one that a great king of israel built and finished but because our fathers angered the god of heaven he handed them over to nebuchadnezzar the chaldean king of babylon who destroyed this temple and deported the people to babylon however in the first year of cyrus king of babylon king cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of god he even removed from the temple of babylon the gold and silver articles of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in jerusalem and brought to the temple in babylon then king cyrus gave them to a man named sheshbazzar whom he had appointed governor and he told him take these articles and go and deposit them in the temple in jerusalem and rebuild the house of god on its site so this sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the house of god in jerusalem from that day to the present it has been under construction but is not yet finished now if it pleases the king let a search be made in the royal archives of babylon to see if king cyrus did in fact issue a decree to rebuild this house of god in jerusalem then let the king send us his decision in this matter king darius then issued an order and they searched in the archives stored in the treasury at babylon a scroll was found in the citadel of ecbatana in the province of media and this was written on it memorandum in the first year of king cyrus the king issued a decree concerning the temple of god in jerusalem let the temple be rebuilt as a place to present sacrifices and let its foundations be laid it is to be ninety feet high and ninety feet wide with three courses of large stones and one of timbers the costs are to be paid by the royal treasury also the gold and silver articles of the house of god which nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in jerusalem and brought to babylon are to be returned to their places in the temple in jerusalem they are to be deposited in the house of god now then tattenai governor of trans euphrates and shethar bozenai and you their fellow officials of that province stay away from there do not interfere with the work on this temple of god let the governor of the jews and the jewish elders rebuild this house of god on its site moreover i hereby decree what you are to do for these elders of the jews in the construction of this house of god the expenses of these men are to be fully paid out of the royal treasury from the revenues of trans euphrates so that the work will not stop whatever is needed young bulls rams male lambs for burnt offerings to the god of heaven and wheat salt wine and oil as requested by the priests in jerusalem must be given them daily without fail so that they may offer sacrifices pleasing to the god of heaven and pray for the well being of the king and his sons furthermore i decree that if anyone changes this edict a beam is to be pulled from his house and he is to be lifted up and impaled on it and for this crime his house is to be made a pile of rubble may god who has caused his name to dwell there overthrow any king or people who lifts a hand to change this decree or to destroy this temple in jerusalem i darius have decreed it let it be carried out with diligence then because of the decree king darius had sent tattenai governor of trans euphrates and shethar bozenai and their associates carried it out with diligence so the elders of the jews continued to build and prosper under the preaching of haggai the prophet and zechariah a descendant of iddo they finished building the temple according to the command of the god of israel and the decrees of cyrus darius and artaxerxes kings of persia the temple was completed on the third day of the month adar in the sixth year of the reign of king darius then the people of israel the priests the levites and the rest of the exiles celebrated the dedication of the house of god with joy for the dedication of this house of god they offered a hundred bulls two hundred rams four hundred male lambs and as a sin offering for all israel twelve male goats one for each of the tribes of israel and they installed the priests in their divisions and the levites in their groups for the service of god at jerusalem according to what is written in the book of moses on the fourteenth day of the first month the exiles celebrated the passover the priests and levites had purified themselves and were all ceremonially clean the levites slaughtered the passover lamb for all the exiles for their brothers the priests and for themselves so the israelites who had returned from the exile ate it together with all who had separated themselves from the unclean practices of their gentile neighbors in order to seek the lord the god of israel for seven days they celebrated with joy the feast of unleavened bread because the lord had filled them with joy by changing the attitude of the king of assyria so that he assisted them in the work on the house of god the god of israel after these things during the reign of artaxerxes king of persia ezra son of seraiah the son of azariah the son of hilkiah the son of shallum the son of zadok the son of

king artaxerxes had given to ezra the priest and teacher a man learned in matters concerning the commands and decrees of the lord for israel artaxerxes king of kings to ezra the priest a teacher of the law of the god of heaven greetings now i decree that any of the israelites in my kingdom including priests and levites who wish to go to jerusalem with you may go you are sent by the king and his

jerusalem in this way and who has extended his good favor to me before the king and his advisers and all the kings powerful officials because the hand of the lord my god was on me i took courage and gathered leading men from israel to go up with me these are the family heads and those registered with them who came up with me from babylon during the reign of king artaxerxes of the descendants of phinehas gershom of the descendants of ithamar daniel of the descendants of david hattush of the descendants of shecaniah of the descendants of parosh zechariah and with him were registered 150 men of the descendants of pahath moab eliehoenai son of zerahiah and with him 200 men of the descendants of zattu shecaniah son of jahaziel and with him 300 men of the descendants of adin ebed son of jonathan and with him 50 men of the descendants of elam jeshaiah son of athaliah and with him 70 men of the descendants of shephatiah zebadiah son of michael and with him 80 men of the descendants of joab obadiah son of jehiel and with him 218 men of the descendants of bani shelomith son of josiphiah and with him 160 men of the descendants of bebai zechariah son of bebai and with him 28 men of the descendants of azgad johanan son of hakkatan and with him 110 men of the descendants of adonikam the last ones whose names were eliphelet jeuel and shemaiah and with them 60 men of the descendants of bigvai uthai and zaccur and with them 70 men i assembled them at the canal that flows toward ahava and we camped there three days when i checked among the people and the priests i found no levites there so i summoned eliezer ariel shemaiah elnathan jarib elnathan nathan zechariah and meshullam who were leaders and joiarib and elnathan who were men of learning and i sent them to iddo the leader in casiphia i told them what to say to iddo and his kinsmen the temple servants in casiphia so that they might bring attendants to us for the house of our god because the gracious hand of our god was on us they brought us sherebiah a capable man from the descendants of mahli son of levi the son of israel and sherebiahs sons and brothers 18 men and hashabiah together with jeshaiah from the descendants of merari and his brothers and nephews 20 men they also brought 220 of the temple servants a body that david and the officials had established to assist the levites all were registered by name there by the ahava canal i proclaimed a fast so that we might humble ourselves before our god and ask him for a safe journey for us and our children with all our possessions i was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen to protect us from enemies on the road because we had told the king the gracious hand of our god is on everyone who looks to him but his great anger is against all who forsake him so we fasted and petitioned our god about this and he answered our prayer then i set apart twelve of the leading priests together with sherebiah hashabiah and ten of their brothers and i weighed out to them the offering of silver and gold and the articles that the king his advisers his officials and all israel present there had donated for the house of our god i weighed out to them 650 talents of silver silver articles weighing 100 talents 100 talents of gold 20 bowls of gold valued at 1000 darics and two fine articles of polished bronze as precious as gold i said to them you as well as these articles are consecrated to the lord the silver and gold are a freewill offering to the lord the god of your fathers guard them carefully until you weigh them out in the chambers of the house of the lord in jerusalem before the leading priests and the levites and the family heads of israel then the priests and levites received the silver and gold and sacred articles that had been weighed out to be taken to the house of our god in jerusalem on the twelfth day of the first month we set out from the ahava canal to go to jerusalem the hand of our god was on us and he protected us from enemies and bandits along the way so we arrived in jerusalem where we rested three days on the fourth day in the house of our god we weighed out the silver and gold and the sacred articles into the hands of meremoth son of uriah the priest eleazar son of phinehas was with him and so were the levites jozabad son of jeshua and noadiah son of binnui everything was accounted for by number and weight and the entire weight was recorded at that time then the exiles who had returned from captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the god of israel twelve bulls for all israel ninety six rams seventy seven male lambs and as a sin offering twelve male goats all this was a burnt offering to the lord they also delivered the kings orders to the royal satraps and to the governors of trans euphrates who then gave assistance to the people and to the house of god after these things had been done the leaders came to me and said the people of israel including the priests and the levites have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices like those of the canaanites hittites perizzites jebusites ammonites moabites egyptians and amorites they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them and the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness when i heard this i tore my tunic and cloak pulled hair from my head and beard and sat down appalled then everyone who trembled at the words of the god of israel gathered around me because of this unfaithfulness of the exiles and i sat there appalled until the evening sacrifice then at the evening sacrifice i rose from my self abasement with my tunic and cloak torn and fell on my knees with my hands spread out to the lord my god and prayed o my god i am too ashamed and disgraced to lift up my face to you my god because our sins are higher than our heads and our guilt has reached to the heavens from the days of our forefathers until now our guilt has been great because of our sins we and our kings and our priests have been subjected to the sword and captivity to pillage and humiliation at the hand of foreign kings as it is today but now for a brief moment the lord our god has been gracious in leaving us a remnant and giving us a firm place in his sanctuary and so our god gives light to our eyes and a little relief in our bondage though we are slaves our god has not deserted us in our bondage he has shown us kindness in the sight of the kings of persia he has granted us new life to rebuild the house of our god and repair its ruins and he has given us a wall of protection in judah and jerusalem but now o our god what can we say after this for we have disregarded the commands you gave through your servants the prophets when you said the land you are entering to possess is a land polluted by the corruption of its peoples by their detestable practices they have filled it with their impurity from one end to the other therefore do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons or take their daughters for your sons do not seek a treaty of friendship with them at any time that you may be strong and eat the good things of the land and leave it to your children as an everlasting inheritance what has happened to us is a result of our evil deeds and our great guilt and yet our god you have punished us less than our sins have deserved and have given us a remnant like this shall we again break your commands and intermarry with the peoples who commit such detestable practices would you not be angry enough with us to destroy us leaving us no remnant or survivor o lord god of israel you are righteous we are left this day as a remnant here we are before you in our guilt though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence while ezra was praying and confessing weeping and throwing himself down before the house of god a large crowd of israelites men women and children gathered around him they too wept bitterly then shecaniah son of jehiel one of the descendants of elam said to ezra we have been unfaithful to our god by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us but in spite of this there is still hope for israel now let us make a covenant before our god to send away all these women and their children in accordance with the counsel of my lord and of those who fear the commands of our god let it be done according to the law rise up this matter is in your hands we will support you so take courage and do it so ezra rose up and put the leading priests and levites and all israel under oath to do what had been suggested and they took the oath then ezra withdrew from before the house of god and went to the room of jehohanan son of eliashib while he was there he ate no food and drank no water because he continued to mourn over the unfaithfulness of the exiles a proclamation was then issued throughout judah and jerusalem for all the exiles to assemble in jerusalem anyone who failed to appear within three days would forfeit all his property in accordance with the decision of the officials and elders and would himself be expelled from the assembly of the exiles within the three days all the men of judah and benjamin had gathered in jerusalem and on the twentieth day of the ninth month all the people were sitting in the square before the house of god greatly distressed by the occasion and because of the rain then ezra the priest stood up and said to them you have been unfaithful you have married foreign women adding to israels guilt now make confession to the lord the god of your fathers and do his will separate yourselves from the peoples around you and from your foreign wives the whole assembly responded with a loud voice you are right we must do as you say but there are many people here and it is the rainy season so we cannot stand outside besides this matter cannot be taken care of in a day or two because we have sinned greatly in this thing let our officials act for the whole assembly then let everyone in our towns who has married a foreign woman come at a set time along with the elders and judges of each town until the fierce anger of our god in this matter is turned away from us only jonathan son of asahel and jahzeiah son of tikvah supported by meshullam and shabbethai the levite opposed this so the exiles did as was proposed ezra the priest selected men who were family heads one from each family division and all of them designated by name on the first day of the tenth month they sat down to investigate the cases and by the first day of the first month they finished dealing with all the men who had married foreign women among the descendants of the priests the following had married foreign women from the descendants of jeshua son of jozadak and his brothers maaseiah eliezer jarib and gedaliah they all gave their hands in pledge to put away their wives and for their guilt they each presented a ram from the flock as a guilt offering from the descendants of immer hanani and zebadiah from the descendants of harim maaseiah elijah shemaiah jehiel and uzziah from the descendants of pashhur elioenai maaseiah ishmael nethanel jozabad and elasah among the levites jozabad shimei kelaiah that is kelita pethahiah judah and eliezer from the singers eliashib from the gatekeepers shallum telem and uri and among the other israelites from the descendants of parosh ramiah izziah malkijah mijamin eleazar malkijah and benaiah from the descendants of elam mattaniah zechariah jehiel abdi jeremoth and elijah from the descendants of zattu elioenai eliashib mattaniah jeremoth zabad and aziza from the descendants of bebai jehohanan hananiah zabbai and athlai from the descendants of bani meshullam malluch adaiah jashub sheal and jeremoth from the descendants of pahath moab adna kelal benaiah maaseiah mattaniah bezalel binnui and manasseh from the descendants of harim eliezer ishijah malkijah shemaiah shimeon benjamin malluch and shemariah from the descendants of hashum mattenai mattattah zabad eliphelet jeremai manasseh and shimei from the descendants of bani maadai amram uel benaiah bedeiah keluhi vaniah meremoth eliashib mattaniah mattenai and jaasu from the descendants of binnui shimei shelemiah nathan adaiah macnadebai shashai sharai azarel shelemiah shemariah shallum amariah and joseph from the descendants of nebo jeiel mattithiah zabad zebina jaddai joel and benaiah all these had married foreign women and some of them had children by these wives  the words of nehemiah son of hacaliah in the month of kislev in the twentieth year while i was in the citadel of susa hanani one of my brothers came from judah with some other men and i questioned them about the jewish remnant that survived the exile and also about jerusalem they said to me those who survived the exile and are back in the province are in great trouble and disgrace the wall of jerusalem is broken down and its gates have been burned with fire when i heard these things i sat down and wept for some days i mourned and fasted and prayed before the god of heaven then i said o lord god of heaven the great and awesome god who keeps his covenant of love with those who love him and obey his commands let your ear be attentive and your eyes open to hear the prayer your servant is praying before you day and night for your servants the people of israel i confess the sins we israelites including myself and my fathers house have committed against you we have acted very wickedly toward you we have not obeyed the commands decrees and laws you gave your servant moses remember the instruction you gave your servant moses saying if you are unfaithful i will scatter you among the nations but if you return to me and obey my commands then even if your exiled people are at the farthest horizon i will gather them from there and bring them to the place i have chosen as a dwelling for my name they are your servants and your people whom you redeemed by your great strength and your mighty hand o lord let your ear be attentive to the prayer of this your servant and to the prayer of your servants who delight in revering your name give your servant success today by granting him favor in the presence of this man i was cupbearer to the king in the month of nisan in the twentieth year of king artaxerxes when wine was brought for him i took the wine and gave it to the king i had not been sad in his presence before so the king asked me why does your face look so sad when you are not ill this can be nothing but sadness of heart i was very much afraid but i said to the king may the king live forever why should my face not look sad when the city where my fathers are buried lies in ruins and its gates have been destroyed by fire the king said to me what is it you want then i prayed to the god of heaven and i answered the king if it pleases the king and if your servant has found favor in his sight let him send me to the city in judah where my fathers are buried so that i can rebuild it then the king with the queen sitting beside him asked me how long will your journey take and when will you get back it pleased the king to send me so i set a time i also said to him if it pleases the king may i have letters to the governors of trans euphrates so that they will provide me safe conduct until i arrive in judah and may i have a letter to asaph keeper of the kings forest so he will give me timber to make beams for the gates of the citadel by the temple and for the city wall and for the residence i will occupy and because the gracious hand of my god was upon me the king granted my requests so i went to the governors of trans euphrates and gave them the kings letters the king had also sent army officers and cavalry with me when sanballat the horonite and tobiah the ammonite official heard about this they were very much disturbed that someone had come to promote the welfare of the israelites i went to jerusalem and after staying there three days i set out during the night with a few men i had not told anyone what my god had put in my heart to do for jerusalem there were no mounts with me except the one i was riding on by night i went out through the valley gate toward the jackal well and the dung gate examining the walls of jerusalem which had been broken down and its gates which had been destroyed by fire then i moved on toward the fountain gate and the kings pool but there was not enough room for my mount to get through so i went up the valley by night examining the wall finally i turned back and reentered through the valley gate the officials did not know where i had gone or what i was doing because as yet i had said nothing to the jews or the priests or nobles or officials or any others who would be doing the work then i said to them you see the trouble we are in jerusalem lies in ruins and its gates have been burned with fire come let us rebuild the wall of jerusalem and we will no longer be in disgrace i also told them about the gracious hand of my god upon me and what the king had said to me they replied let us start rebuilding so they began this good work but when sanballat the horonite tobiah the ammonite official and geshem the arab heard about it they mocked and ridiculed us what is this you are doing they asked are you rebelling against the king i answered them by saying the god of heaven will give us success we his servants will start rebuilding but as for you you have no share in jerusalem or any claim or historic right to it eliashib the high priest and his fellow priests went to work and rebuilt the sheep gate they dedicated it and set its doors in place building as

merchants opposite the inspection gate and as far as the room above the corner and between the room above the corner and the sheep gate the goldsmiths and merchants made repairs when sanballat heard that we were rebuilding the wall he became angry and was greatly incensed he ridiculed the jews and in the presence of his associates and the army of samaria he said what are those feeble jews doing will they restore their wall will they offer sacrifices will they finish in a day can they bring the stones back to life from those heaps of rubble burned as they are tobiah the ammonite who was at his side said what they are building if even a fox climbed up on it he would break down their wall of stones hear us o our god for we are despised turn their insults back on their own heads give them over as plunder in a land of captivity do not cover up their guilt or blot out their sins from your sight for they have thrown insults in the face of the builders so we rebuilt the wall till all of it reached half its height for the people worked with all their heart but when sanballat tobiah the arabs the ammonites and the men of ashdod heard that the repairs to jerusalems walls had gone ahead and that the gaps were being closed they were very angry they all plotted together to come and fight against jerusalem and stir up trouble against it but we prayed to our god and posted a guard day and night to meet this threat meanwhile the people in judah said the strength of the laborers is giving out and there is so much rubble that we cannot rebuild the wall also our enemies said before they know it or see us we will be right there among them and will kill them and put an end to the work then the jews who lived near them came and told us ten times over wherever you turn they will attack us therefore i stationed some of the people behind the lowest points of the wall at the exposed places posting them by families with their swords spears and bows after i looked things over i stood up and said to the nobles the officials and the rest of the people dont be afraid of them remember the lord who is great and awesome and fight for your brothers your sons and your daughters your wives and your homes when our enemies heard that we were aware of their plot and that god had frustrated it we all returned to the wall each to his own work from that day on half of my men did the work while the other half were equipped with spears shields bows and armor the officers posted themselves behind all the people of judah who were building the wall those who carried materials did their work with one hand and held a weapon in the other and each of the builders wore his sword at his side as he worked but the man who sounded the trumpet stayed with me then i said to the nobles the officials and the rest of the people the work is extensive and spread out and we are widely separated from each other along the wall wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet join us there our god will fight for us so we continued the work with half the men holding spears from the first light of dawn till the stars came out at that time i also said to the people have every man and his helper stay inside jerusalem at night so they can serve us as guards by night and workmen by day neither i nor my brothers nor my men nor the guards with me took off our clothes each had his weapon even when he went for water now the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their jewish brothers some were saying we and our sons and daughters are numerous in order for us to eat and stay alive we must get grain others were saying we are mortgaging our fields our vineyards and our homes to get grain during the famine still others were saying we have had to borrow money to pay the kings tax on our fields and vineyards although we are of the same flesh and blood as our countrymen and though our sons are as good as theirs yet we have to subject our sons and daughters to slavery some of our daughters have already been enslaved but we are powerless because our fields and our vineyards belong to others when i heard their outcry and these charges i was very angry i pondered them in my mind and then accused the nobles and officials i told them you are exacting usury from your own countrymen so i called together a large meeting to deal with them and said as far as possible we have bought back our jewish brothers who were sold to the gentiles now you are selling your brothers only for them to be sold back to us they kept quiet because they could find nothing to say so i continued what you are doing is not right shouldnt you walk in the fear of our god to avoid the reproach of our gentile enemies i and my brothers and my men are also lending the people money and grain but let the exacting of usury stop give back to them immediately their fields vineyards olive groves and houses and also the usury you are charging them the hundredth part of the money grain new wine and oil we will give it back they said and we will not demand anything more from them we will do as you say then i summoned the priests and made the nobles and officials take an oath to do what they had promised i also shook out the folds of my robe and said in this way may god shake out of his house and possessions every man who does not keep this promise so may such a man be shaken out and emptied at this the whole assembly said amen and praised the lord and the people did as they had promised moreover from the twentieth year of king artaxerxes when i was appointed to be their governor in the land of judah until his thirty second year twelve years neither i nor my brothers ate the food allotted to the governor but the earlier governors those preceding me placed a heavy burden on the people and took forty shekels of silver from them in addition to food and wine their assistants also lorded it over the people but out of reverence for god i did not act like that instead i devoted myself to the work on this wall all my men were assembled there for the work we did not acquire any land furthermore a hundred and fifty jews and officials ate at my table as well as those who came to us from the surrounding nations each day one ox six choice sheep and some poultry were prepared for me and every ten days an abundant supply of wine of all kinds in spite of all this i never demanded the food allotted to the governor because the demands were heavy on these people remember me with favor o my god for all i have done for these people when word came to sanballat tobiah geshem the arab and the rest of our enemies that i had rebuilt the wall and not a gap was left in it though up to that time i had not set the doors in the gates sanballat and geshem sent me this message come let us meet together in one of the villages on the plain of ono but they were scheming to harm me so i sent messengers to them with this reply i am carrying on a great project and cannot go down why should the work stop while i leave it and go down to you four times they sent me the same message and each time i gave them the same answer then the fifth time sanballat sent his aide to me with the same message and in his hand was an unsealed letter in which was written it is reported among the nations and geshem says it is true that you and the jews are plotting to revolt and therefore you are building the wall moreover according to these reports you are about to become their king and have even appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in jerusalem there is a king in judah now this report will get back to the king so come let us confer together i sent him this reply nothing like what you are saying is happening you are just making it up out of your head they were all trying to frighten us thinking their hands will get too weak for the work and it will not be completed but i prayed now strengthen my hands one day i went to the house of shemaiah son of delaiah the son of mehetabel who was shut in at his home he said let us meet in the house of god inside the temple and let us close the temple doors because men are coming to kill you by night they are coming to kill you but i said should a man like me run away or should one like me go into the temple to save his life i will not go i realized that god had not sent him but that he had prophesied against me because tobiah and sanballat had hired him he had been hired to intimidate me so that i would commit a sin by doing this and then they would give me a bad name to discredit me remember tobiah and sanballat o my god because of what they have done remember also the prophetess noadiah and the rest of the prophets who have been trying to intimidate me so the wall was completed on the twenty fifth of elul in fifty two days when all our enemies heard about this all the surrounding nations were afraid and lost their self confidence because they realized that this work had been done with the help of our god also in those days the nobles of judah were sending many letters to tobiah and replies from tobiah kept coming to them for many in judah were under oath to him since he was son in law to shecaniah son of arah and his son jehohanan had married the daughter of meshullam son of berekiah moreover they kept reporting to me his good deeds and then telling him what i said and tobiah sent letters to intimidate me after the wall had been rebuilt and i had set the doors in place the gatekeepers and the singers and the levites were appointed i put in charge of jerusalem my brother hanani along with hananiah the commander of the citadel because he was a man of integrity and feared god more than most men do i said to them the gates of jerusalem are not to be opened until the sun is hot while the gatekeepers are still on duty have them shut the doors and bar them also appoint residents of jerusalem as guards some at their posts and some near their own houses now the city was large and spacious but there were few people in it and the houses had not yet been rebuilt so my god put it into my heart to assemble the nobles the officials and the common people for registration by families i found the genealogical record of those who had been the first to return this is what i found written there these are the people of the province who came up from the captivity of the exiles whom nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had taken captive they returned to jerusalem and judah each to his own town in company with zerubbabel jeshua nehemiah azariah raamiah nahamani mordecai bilshan

before the assembly which was made up of men and women and all who were able to understand he read it aloud from daybreak till noon as he faced the square before the water gate in the presence of the men women and others who could understand and all the people listened attentively to the book of the law ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform built for the occasion beside him on his right

ezra the priest and scribe and the levites who were instructing the people said to them all this day is sacred to the lord your god do not mourn or weep for all the people had been weeping as they listened to the words of the law nehemiah said go and enjoy choice food and sweet drinks and send some to those who have nothing prepared this day is sacred to our lord do not grieve for the joy of the lord is your strength the levites calmed all the people saying be still for this is a sacred day do not grieve then all the people went away to eat and drink to send portions of food and to celebrate with great joy because they now understood the words that had been made known to them on the second day of the month the heads of all the families along with the priests and the levites gathered around ezra the scribe to give attention to the words of the law they found written in the law which the lord had commanded through moses that the israelites were to live in booths during the feast of the seventh month and that they should proclaim this word and spread it throughout their towns and in jerusalem go out into the hill country and bring back branches from olive and wild olive trees and from myrtles palms and shade trees to make booths as it is written so the people went out and brought back branches and built themselves booths on their own roofs in their courtyards in the courts of the house of god and in the square by the water gate and the one by the gate of ephraim the whole company that had returned from exile built booths and lived in them from the days of joshua son of nun until that day the israelites had not celebrated it like this and their joy was very great day after day from the first day to the last ezra read from the book of the law of god they celebrated the feast for seven days and on the eighth day in accordance with the regulation there was an assembly on the twenty fourth day of the same month the israelites gathered together fasting and wearing sackcloth and having dust on their heads those of israelite descent had separated themselves from all foreigners they stood in their places and confessed their sins and the wickedness of their fathers they stood where they were and read from the book of the law of the lord their god for a quarter of the day and spent another quarter in confession and in worshiping the lord their god standing on the stairs were the levites jeshua bani kadmiel shebaniah bunni sherebiah bani and kenani who called with loud voices to the lord their god and the levites jeshua kadmiel bani hashabneiah sherebiah hodiah shebaniah and pethahiah said stand up and praise the lord your god who is from everlasting to everlasting blessed be your glorious name and may it be exalted above all blessing and praise you alone are the lord you made the heavens even the highest heavens and all their starry host the earth and all that is on it the seas and all that is in them you give life to everything and the multitudes of heaven worship you you are the lord god who chose abram and brought him out of ur of the chaldeans and named him abraham you found his heart faithful to you and you made a covenant with him to give to his descendants the land of the canaanites hittites amorites perizzites jebusites and girgashites you have kept your promise because you are righteous you saw the suffering of our forefathers in egypt you heard their cry at the red sea you sent miraculous signs and wonders against pharaoh against all his officials and all the people of his land for you knew how arrogantly the egyptians treated them you made a name for yourself which remains to this day you divided the sea before them so that they passed through it on dry ground but you hurled their pursuers into the depths like a stone into mighty waters by day you led them with a pillar of cloud and by night with a pillar of fire to give them light on the way they were to take you came down on mount sinai you spoke to them from heaven you gave them regulations and laws that are just and right and decrees and commands that are good you made known to them your holy sabbath and gave them commands decrees and laws through your servant moses in their hunger you gave them bread from heaven and in their thirst you brought them water from the rock you told them to go in and take possession of the land you had sworn with uplifted hand to give them but they our forefathers became arrogant and stiff necked and did not obey your commands they refused to listen and failed to remember the miracles you performed among them they became stiff necked and in their rebellion appointed a leader in order to return to their slavery but you are a forgiving god gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love therefore you did not desert them even when they cast for themselves an image of a calf and said this is your god who brought you up out of egypt or when they committed awful blasphemies because of your great compassion you did not abandon them in the desert by day the pillar of cloud did not cease to guide them on their path nor the pillar of fire by night to shine on the way they were to take you gave your good spirit to instruct them you did not withhold your manna from their mouths and you gave them water for their thirst for forty years you sustained them in the desert they lacked nothing their clothes did not wear out nor did their feet become swollen you gave them kingdoms and nations allotting to them even the remotest frontiers they took over the country of sihon king of heshbon and the country of og king of bashan you made their sons as numerous as the stars in the sky and you brought them into the land that you told their fathers to enter and possess their sons went in and took possession of the land you subdued before them the canaanites who lived in the land you handed the canaanites over to them along with their kings and the peoples of the land to deal with them as they pleased they captured fortified cities and fertile land they took possession of houses filled with all kinds of good things wells already dug vineyards olive groves and fruit trees in abundance they ate to the full and were well nourished they reveled in your great goodness but they were disobedient and rebelled against you they put your law behind their backs they killed your prophets who had admonished them in order to turn them back to you they committed awful blasphemies so you handed them over to their enemies who oppressed them but when they were oppressed they cried out to you from heaven you heard them and in your great compassion you gave them deliverers who rescued them from the hand of their enemies but as soon as they were at rest they again did what was evil in your sight then you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies so that they ruled over them and when they cried out to you again you heard from heaven and in your compassion you delivered them time after time you warned them to return to your law but they became arrogant and disobeyed your commands they sinned against your ordinances by which a man will live if he obeys them stubbornly they turned their backs on you became stiff necked and refused to listen for many years you were patient with them by your spirit you admonished them through your prophets yet they paid no attention so you handed them over to the neighboring peoples but in your great mercy you did not put an end to them or abandon them for you are a gracious and merciful god now therefore o our god the great mighty and awesome god who keeps his covenant of love do not let all this hardship seem trifling in your eyes the hardship that has come upon us upon our kings and leaders upon our priests and prophets upon our fathers and all your people from the days of the kings of assyria until today in all that has happened to us you have been just you have acted faithfully while we did wrong our kings our leaders our priests and our fathers did not follow your law they did not pay attention to your commands or the warnings you gave them even while they were in their kingdom enjoying your great goodness to them in the spacious and fertile land you gave them they did not serve you or turn from their evil ways but see we are slaves today slaves in the land you gave our forefathers so they could eat its fruit and the other good things it produces because of our sins its abundant harvest goes to the kings you have placed over us they rule over our bodies and our cattle as they please we

ceremonially they purified the people the gates and the wall i had the leaders of judah go up on top of the wall i also assigned two large choirs to give thanks one was to proceed on top of the wall

charge of the storerooms for the contributions firstfruits and tithes from the fields around the towns they were to bring into the storerooms the portions required by the law for the priests and the levites for judah was pleased with the ministering priests and levites they performed the service of their god and the service of purification as did also the singers and gatekeepers according to the commands of david and his son solomon for long ago in the days of david and asaph there had been directors for the singers and for the songs of praise and thanksgiving to god so in the days of zerubbabel and of nehemiah all israel contributed the daily portions for the singers and gatekeepers they also set aside the portion for the other levites and the levites set aside the portion for the descendants of aaron on that day the book of moses was read aloud in the hearing of the people and there it was found written that no ammonite or moabite should ever be admitted into the assembly of god because they had not met the israelites with food and water but had hired balaam to call a curse down on them our god however turned the curse into a blessing when the people heard this law they excluded from israel all who were of foreign descent before this eliashib the priest had been put in charge of the storerooms of the house of our god he was closely associated with tobiah and he had provided him with a large room formerly used to store the grain offerings and incense and temple articles and also the tithes of grain new wine and oil prescribed for the levites singers and gatekeepers as well as the contributions for the priests but while all this was going on i was not in jerusalem for in the thirty second year of artaxerxes king of babylon i had returned to the king some time later i asked his permission and came back to jerusalem here i learned about the evil thing eliashib had done in providing tobiah a room in the courts of the house of god i was greatly displeased and threw all tobiahs household goods out of the room i gave orders to purify the rooms and then i put back into them the equipment of the house of god with the grain offerings and the incense i also learned that the portions assigned to the levites had not been given to them and that all the levites and singers responsible for the service had gone back to their own fields so i rebuked the officials and asked them why is the house of god neglected then i called them together and stationed them at their posts all judah brought the tithes of grain new wine and oil into the storerooms i put shelemiah the priest zadok the scribe and a levite named pedaiah in charge of the storerooms and made hanan son of zaccur the son of mattaniah their assistant because these men were considered trustworthy they were made responsible for distributing the supplies to their brothers remember me for this o my god and do not blot out what i have so faithfully done for the house of my god and its services in those days i saw men in judah treading winepresses on the sabbath and bringing in grain and loading it on donkeys together with wine grapes figs and all other kinds of loads and they were bringing all this into jerusalem on the sabbath therefore i warned them against selling food on that day men from tyre who lived in jerusalem were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and selling them in jerusalem on the sabbath to the people of judah i rebuked the nobles of judah and said to them what is this wicked thing you are doing desecrating the sabbath day didnt your forefathers do the same things so that our god brought all this calamity upon us and upon this city now you are stirring up more wrath against israel by desecrating the sabbath when evening shadows fell on the gates of jerusalem before the sabbath i ordered the doors to be shut and not opened until the sabbath was over i stationed some of my own men at the gates so that no load could be brought in on the sabbath day once or twice the merchants and sellers of all kinds of goods spent the night outside jerusalem but i warned them and said why do you spend the night by the wall if you do this again i will lay hands on you from that time on they no longer came on the sabbath then i commanded the levites to purify themselves and go and guard the gates in order to keep the sabbath day holy remember me for this also o my god and show mercy to me according to your great love moreover in those days i saw men of judah who had married women from ashdod ammon and moab half of their children spoke the language of ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples and did not know how to speak the language of judah i rebuked them and called curses down on them i beat some of the men and pulled out their hair i made them take an oath in gods name and said you are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves was it not because of marriages like these that solomon king of israel sinned among the many nations there was no king like him he was loved by his god and god made him king over all israel but even he was led into sin by foreign women must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our god by marrying foreign women one of the sons of joiada son of eliashib the high priest was son in law to sanballat the horonite and i drove him away from me remember them o my god because they defiled the priestly office and the covenant of the priesthood and of the levites so i purified the priests and the levites of everything foreign and assigned them duties each to his own task i also made provision for contributions of wood at designated times and for the firstfruits remember me with favor o my god  this is what happened during the time of xerxes the xerxes who ruled over 127 provinces stretching from india to cush at that time king xerxes reigned from his royal throne in the citadel of susa and in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials the military leaders of persia and media the princes and the nobles of the provinces were present for a full 180 days he displayed the vast wealth of his kingdom and the splendor and glory of his majesty when these days were over the king gave a banquet lasting seven days in the enclosed garden of the kings palace for all the people from the least to the greatest who were in the citadel of susa the garden had hangings of white and blue linen fastened with cords of white linen and purple material to silver rings on marble pillars there were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry marble mother of pearl and other costly stones wine was served in goblets of gold each one different from the other and the royal wine was abundant in keeping with the kings liberality by the kings command each guest was allowed to drink in his own way for the king instructed all the wine stewards to serve each man what he wished queen vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of king xerxes on the seventh day when king xerxes was in high spirits from wine he commanded the seven eunuchs who served him mehuman biztha harbona bigtha abagtha zethar and carcas to bring before him queen vashti wearing her royal crown in order to display her beauty to the people and nobles for she was lovely to look at but when the attendants delivered the kings command queen vashti refused to come then the king became furious and burned with anger since it was customary for the king to consult experts in matters of law and justice he spoke with the wise men who understood the times and were closest to the king carshena shethar admatha tarshish meres marsena and memucan the seven nobles of persia and media who had special access to the king and were highest in the kingdom according to law what must be done to queen vashti he asked she has not obeyed the command of king xerxes that the eunuchs have taken to her then memucan replied in the presence of the king and the nobles queen vashti has done wrong not only against the king but also against all the nobles and the peoples of all the provinces of king xerxes for the queens conduct will become known to all the women and so they will despise their husbands and say king xerxes commanded queen vashti to be brought before him but she would not come this very day the persian and median women of the nobility who have heard about the queens conduct will respond to all the kings nobles in the same way there will be no end of disrespect and discord therefore if it pleases the king let him issue a royal decree and let it be written in the laws of persia and media which cannot be repealed that vashti is never again to enter the presence of king xerxes also let the king give her royal position to someone else who is better than she then when the kings edict is proclaimed throughout all his vast realm all the women will respect their husbands from the least to the greatest the king and his nobles were pleased with this advice so the king did as memucan proposed he sent dispatches to all parts of the kingdom to each province in its own script and to each people in its own language proclaiming in each peoples tongue that every man should be ruler over his own household later when the anger of king xerxes had subsided he remembered vashti and what she had done and what he had decreed about her then the kings personal attendants proposed let a search be made for beautiful young virgins for the king let the king appoint commissioners in every province of his realm to bring all these beautiful girls into the harem at the citadel of susa let them be placed under the care of hegai the kings eunuch who is in charge of the women and let beauty treatments be given to them then let the girl who pleases the king be queen instead of vashti this advice appealed to the king and he followed it now there was in the citadel of susa a jew of the tribe of benjamin named mordecai son of jair the son of shimei the son of kish who had been carried into exile from jerusalem by nebuchadnezzar king of babylon among those taken captive with jehoiachin king of judah mordecai had a cousin named hadassah whom he had brought up because she had neither father nor mother this girl who was also known as esther was lovely in form and features and mordecai had taken her as his own daughter when her father and mother died when the kings order and edict had been proclaimed many girls were brought to the citadel of susa and put under the care of hegai esther also was taken to the kings palace and entrusted to hegai who had charge of the harem the girl pleased him and won his favor immediately he provided her with her beauty treatments and special food he assigned to her seven maids selected from the kings palace and moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem esther had not revealed her nationality and family background because mordecai had forbidden her to do so every day he walked back and forth near the courtyard of the harem to find out how esther was and what was happening to her before a girls turn came to go in to king xerxes she had to complete twelve months of beauty treatments prescribed for the women six months with oil of myrrh and six with perfumes and cosmetics and this is how she would go to the king anything she wanted was given her to take with her from the harem to the kings palace in the evening she would go there and in the morning return to another part of the harem to the care of shaashgaz the kings eunuch who was in charge of the concubines she would not return to the king unless he was pleased with her and summoned her by name when the turn came for esther the girl mordecai had adopted the daughter of his uncle abihail to go to the king she asked for nothing other than what hegai the kings eunuch who was in charge of the harem suggested and esther won the favor of everyone who saw her she was taken to king xerxes in the royal residence in the tenth month the month of tebeth in the seventh year of his reign now the king was attracted to esther more than to any of the other women and she won his favor and approval more than any of the other virgins so he set a royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of vashti and the king gave a great banquet esthers banquet for all his nobles and officials he proclaimed a holiday throughout the provinces and distributed gifts with royal liberality when the virgins were assembled a second time mordecai was sitting at the kings gate but esther had kept secret her family background and nationality just as mordecai had told her to do for she continued to follow mordecais instructions as she had done when he was bringing her up during the time mordecai was sitting at the kings gate bigthana and teresh two of the kings officers who guarded the doorway became angry and conspired to assassinate king xerxes but mordecai found out about the plot and told queen esther who in turn reported it to the king giving credit to mordecai and when the report was investigated and found to be true the two officials were hanged on a gallows all this was recorded in the book of the annals in the presence of the king after these events king xerxes honored haman son of hammedatha the agagite elevating him and giving him a seat of honor higher than that of all the other nobles all the royal officials at the kings gate knelt down and paid honor to haman for the king had commanded this concerning him but mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor then the royal officials at the kings gate asked mordecai why do you disobey the kings command day after day they spoke to him but he refused to comply therefore they told haman about it to see whether mordecais behavior would be tolerated for he had told them he was a jew when haman saw that mordecai would not kneel down or pay him honor he was enraged yet having learned who mordecais people were he scorned the idea of killing only mordecai instead haman looked for a way to destroy all mordecais people the jews throughout the whole kingdom of xerxes in the twelfth year of king xerxes in the first month the month of nisan they cast the pur that is the lot in the presence of haman to select a day and month and the lot fell on the twelfth month the month of adar then haman said to king xerxes there is a certain people dispersed and scattered among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom whose customs are different from those of all other people and who do not obey the kings laws it is not in the kings best interest to tolerate them if it pleases the king let a decree be issued to destroy them and i will put ten thousand talents of silver into the royal treasury for the men who carry out this business so the king took his signet ring from his finger and gave it to haman son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of the jews keep the money the king said to haman and do with the people as you please then on the thirteenth day of the first month the royal secretaries were summoned they wrote out in the script of each province and in the language of each people all hamans orders to the kings satraps the governors of the various provinces and the nobles of the various peoples these were written in the name of king xerxes himself and sealed with his own ring dispatches were sent by couriers to all the kings provinces with the order to destroy kill and annihilate all the jews young and old women and little children on a single day the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of adar and to plunder their goods a copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so they would be ready for that day spurred on by the kings command the couriers went out and the edict was issued in the citadel of susa the king and haman sat down to drink but the city of susa was bewildered when mordecai learned of all that had been done he tore his clothes put on sackcloth and ashes and went out into the city wailing loudly and bitterly but he went only as far as the kings gate because no one clothed in sackcloth was allowed to enter it in every province to which the edict and order of the king came there was great mourning among the jews with fasting weeping and wailing many lay in sackcloth and ashes when esthers maids and eunuchs came and told her about mordecai she was in great distress she sent clothes for him to put on instead of his sackcloth but he would not accept them then esther summoned hathach one of the kings eunuchs assigned to attend her and ordered him to find out what was troubling mordecai and why so hathach went out to mordecai in the open square of the city in front of the kings gate mordecai told him everything that had happened to him including the exact amount of money haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the jews he also gave him a copy of the text of the edict for their annihilation which had been published in susa to show to esther and explain it to her and he told him to urge her to go into the kings presence to beg for mercy and plead with him for her people hathach went back and reported to esther what mordecai had said then she instructed him to say to mordecai all the kings officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law that he be put to death the only exception to this is for the king to extend the gold scepter to him and spare his life but thirty days have passed since i was called to go to the king when esthers words were reported to mordecai he sent back this answer do not think that because you are in the kings house you alone of all the jews will escape for if you remain silent at this time relief and deliverance for the jews will arise from another place but you and your fathers family will perish and who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this then esther sent this reply to mordecai go gather together all the jews who are in susa and fast for me do not eat or drink for three days night or day i and my maids will fast as you do when this is done i will go to the king even though it is against the law and if i perish i perish so mordecai went away and carried out all of esthers instructions on the third day esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the palace in front of the kings hall the king was sitting on his royal throne in the hall facing the entrance when he saw queen esther standing in the court he was pleased with her and held out to her the gold scepter that was in his hand so esther approached and touched the tip of the scepter then the king asked what is it queen esther what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be given you if it pleases the king replied esther let the king together with haman come today to a banquet i have prepared for him bring haman at once the king said so that we may do what esther asks so the king and haman went to the banquet esther had prepared as they were drinking wine the king again asked esther now what is your petition it will be given you and what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be granted esther replied my petition and my request is this if the king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and fulfill my request let the king and haman come tomorrow to the banquet i will prepare for them then i will answer the kings question haman went out that day happy and in high spirits but when he saw mordecai at the kings gate and observed that he neither rose nor showed fear in his presence he was filled with rage against mordecai nevertheless haman restrained himself and went home calling together his friends and zeresh his wife haman boasted to them about his vast wealth his many sons and all the ways the king had honored him and how he had elevated him above the other nobles and officials and thats not all haman added im the only person queen esther invited to accompany the king to the banquet she gave and she has invited me along with the king tomorrow but all this gives me no satisfaction as long as i see that jew mordecai sitting at the kings gate his wife zeresh and all his friends said to him have a gallows built seventy five feet high and ask the king in the morning to have mordecai hanged on it then go with the king to the dinner and be happy this suggestion delighted haman and he had the gallows built that night the king could not sleep so he ordered the book of the chronicles the record of his reign to be brought in and read to him it was found recorded there that mordecai had exposed bigthana and teresh two of the kings officers who guarded the doorway who had conspired to assassinate king xerxes what honor and recognition has mordecai received for this the king asked nothing has been done for him his attendants answered the king said who is in the court now haman had just entered the outer court of the palace to speak to the king about hanging mordecai on the gallows he had erected for him his attendants answered haman is standing in the courtbring him in the king ordered when haman entered the king asked him what should be done for the man the king delights to honor now haman thought to himself who is there that the king would rather honor than me so he answered the king for the man the king delights to honor have them bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden one with a royal crest placed on its head then let the robe and horse be entrusted to one of the kings most noble princes let them robe the man the king delights to honor and lead him on the horse through the city streets proclaiming before him this is what is done for the man the king delights to honor go at once the king commanded haman get the robe and the horse and do just as you have suggested for mordecai the jew who sits at the kings gate do not neglect anything you have recommended so haman got the robe and the horse he robed mordecai and led him on horseback through the city streets proclaiming before him this is what is done for the man the king delights to honor afterward mordecai returned to the kings gate but haman rushed home with his head covered in grief and told zeresh his wife and all his friends everything that had happened to him his advisers and his wife zeresh said to him since mordecai before whom your downfall has started is of jewish origin you cannot stand against him you will surely come to ruin while they were still talking with him the kings eunuchs arrived and hurried haman away to the banquet esther had prepared so the king and haman went to dine with queen esther and as they were drinking wine on that second day the king again asked queen esther what is your petition it will be given you what is your request even up to half the kingdom it will be granted then queen esther answered if i have found favor with you o king and if it pleases your majesty grant me my life this is my petition and spare my people this is my request for i and my people have been sold for destruction and slaughter and annihilation if we had merely been sold as male and female slaves i would have kept quiet because no such distress would justify disturbing the king king xerxes asked queen esther who is he where is the man who has dared to do such a thing esther said the adversary and enemy is this vile haman then haman was terrified before the king and queen the king got up in a rage left his wine and went out into the palace garden but haman realizing that the king had already decided his fate stayed behind to beg queen esther for his life just as the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet hall haman was falling on the couch where esther was reclining the king exclaimed will he even molest the queen while she is with me in the house as soon as the word left the kings mouth they covered hamans face then harbona one of the eunuchs attending the king said a gallows seventy five feet high stands by hamans house he had it made for mordecai who spoke up to help the king the king said hang him on it so they hanged haman on the gallows he had prepared for mordecai then the kings fury subsided that same day king xerxes gave queen esther the estate of haman the enemy of the jews and mordecai came into the presence of the king for esther had told how he was related to her the king took off his signet ring which he had reclaimed from haman and presented it to mordecai and esther appointed him over hamans estate esther again pleaded with the king falling at his feet and weeping she begged him to put an end to the evil plan of haman the agagite which he had devised against the jews then the king extended the gold scepter to esther and she arose and stood before him if it pleases the king she said and if he regards me with favor and thinks it the right thing to do and if he is pleased with me let an order be written overruling the dispatches that haman son of hammedatha the agagite devised and wrote to destroy the jews in all the kings provinces for how can i bear to see disaster fall on my people how can i bear to see the destruction of my family king xerxes replied to queen esther and to mordecai the jew because haman attacked the jews i have given his estate to esther and they have hanged him on the gallows now write another decree in the kings name in behalf of the jews as seems best to you and seal it with the kings signet ring for no document written in the kings name and sealed with his ring can be revoked at once the royal secretaries were summoned on the twenty third day of the third month the month of sivan they wrote out all mordecais orders to the jews and to the satraps governors and nobles of the 127 provinces stretching from india to cush these orders were written in the script of each province and the language of each people and also to the jews in their own script and language mordecai wrote in the name of king xerxes sealed the dispatches with the kings signet ring and sent them by mounted couriers who rode fast horses especially bred for the king the kings edict granted the jews in every city the right to assemble and protect themselves to destroy kill and annihilate any armed force of any nationality or province that might attack them and their women and children and to plunder the property of their enemies the day appointed for the jews to do this in all the provinces of king xerxes was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of adar a copy of the text of the edict was to be issued as law in every province and made known to the people of every nationality so that the jews would be ready on that day to avenge themselves on their enemies the couriers riding the royal horses raced out spurred on by the kings command and the edict was also issued in the citadel of susa mordecai left the kings presence wearing royal garments of blue and white a large crown of gold and a purple robe of fine linen and the city of susa held a joyous celebration for the jews it was a time of happiness and joy gladness and honor in every province and in every city wherever the edict of the king went there was joy and gladness among the jews with feasting and celebrating and many people of other nationalities became jews because fear of the jews had seized them on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month the month of adar the edict commanded by the king was to be carried out on this day the enemies of the jews had hoped to overpower them but now the tables were turned and the jews got the upper hand over those who hated them the jews assembled in their cities in all the provinces of king xerxes to attack those seeking their destruction no one could stand against them because the people of all the other nationalities were afraid of them and all the nobles of the provinces the satraps the governors and the kings administrators helped the jews because fear of mordecai had seized them mordecai was prominent in the palace his reputation spread throughout the provinces and he became more and more powerful the jews struck down all their enemies with the sword killing and destroying them and they did what they pleased to those who hated them in the citadel of susa the jews killed and destroyed five hundred men they also killed parshandatha dalphon aspatha poratha adalia aridatha parmashta arisai aridai and vaizatha the ten sons of haman son of hammedatha the enemy of the jews but they did not lay their hands on the plunder the number of those slain in the citadel of susa was reported to the king that same day the king said to queen esther the jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of haman in the citadel of susa what have they done in the rest of the kings provinces now what is your petition it will be given you what is your request it will also be granted if it pleases the king esther answered give the jews in susa permission to carry out this days edict tomorrow also and let hamans ten sons be hanged on gallows so the king commanded that this be done an edict was issued in susa and they hanged the ten sons of haman the jews in susa came together on the fourteenth day of the month of adar and they put to death in susa three hundred men but they did not lay their hands on the plunder meanwhile the remainder of the jews who were in the kings provinces also assembled to protect themselves and get relief from their enemies they killed seventy five thousand of them but did not lay their hands on the plunder this happened on the thirteenth day of the month of adar and on the fourteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy the jews in susa however had assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth and then on the fifteenth they rested and made it a day of feasting and joy that is why rural jews those living in villages observe the fourteenth of the month of adar as a day of joy and feasting a day for giving presents to each other mordecai recorded these events and he sent letters to all the jews throughout the provinces of king xerxes near and far to have them celebrate annually the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month of adar as the time when the jews got relief from their enemies and as the month when their sorrow was turned into joy and their mourning into a day of celebration he wrote them to observe the days as days of feasting and joy and giving presents of food to one another and gifts to the poor so the jews agreed to continue the celebration they had begun doing what mordecai had written to them for haman son of hammedatha the agagite the enemy of all the jews had plotted against the jews to destroy them and had cast the pur that is the lot for their ruin and destruction but when the plot came to the kings attention he issued written orders that the evil scheme haman had devised against the jews should come back onto his own head and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows therefore these days were called purim from the word pur because of everything written in this letter and because of what they had seen and what had happened to them the jews took it upon themselves to establish the custom that they and their descendants and all who join them should without fail observe these two days every year in the way prescribed and at the time appointed these days should be remembered and observed in every generation by every family and in every province and in every city and these days of purim should never cease to be celebrated by the jews nor should the memory of them die out among their descendants so queen esther daughter of abihail along with mordecai the jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning purim and mordecai sent letters to all the jews in the 127 provinces of the kingdom of xerxes words of goodwill and assurance to establish these days of purim at their designated times as mordecai the jew and queen esther had decreed for them and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation esthers decree confirmed these regulations about purim and it was written down in the records king xerxes imposed tribute throughout the empire to its distant shores and all his acts of power and might together with a full account of the greatness of mordecai to which the king had raised him are they not written in the book of the annals of the kings of media and persia mordecai the jew was second in rank to king xerxes preeminent among the jews and held in high esteem by his many fellow jews because he worked for the good of his people and spoke up for the welfare of all the jews  in the land of uz there lived a man whose name was job this man was blameless and upright he feared god and shunned evil he had seven sons and three daughters and he owned seven thousand sheep three thousand camels five hundred yoke of oxen and five hundred donkeys and had a large number of servants he was the greatest man among all the people of the east his sons used to take turns holding feasts in their homes and they would invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them when a period of feasting had run its course job would send and have them purified early in the morning he would sacrifice a burnt offering for each of them thinking perhaps my children have sinned and cursed god in their hearts this was jobs regular custom one day the angels came to present themselves before the lord and satan also came with them the lord said to satan where have you come from satan answered the lord from roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it then the lord said to satan have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears god and shuns evil does job fear god for nothing satan replied have you not put a hedge around him and his household and everything he has you have blessed the work of his hands so that his flocks and herds are spread throughout the land but stretch out your hand and strike everything he has and he will surely curse you to your face the lord said to satan very well then everything he has is in your hands but on the man himself do not lay a finger then satan went out from the presence of the lord one day when jobs sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brothers house a messenger came to job and said the oxen were plowing and the donkeys were grazing nearby and the sabeans attacked and carried them off they put the servants to the sword and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you while he was still speaking another messenger came and said the fire of god fell from the sky and burned up the sheep and the servants and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you while he was still speaking another messenger came and said the chaldeans formed three raiding parties and swept down on your camels and carried them off they put the servants to the sword and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you while he was still speaking yet another messenger came and said your sons and daughters were feasting and drinking wine at the oldest brothers house when suddenly a mighty wind swept in from the desert and struck the four corners of the house it collapsed on them and they are dead and i am the only one who has escaped to tell you at this job got up and tore his robe and shaved his head then he fell to the ground in worship and said naked i came from my mothers womb and naked i will depart the lord gave and the lord has taken away may the name of the lord be praised in all this job did not sin by charging god with wrongdoing on another day the angels came to present themselves before the lord and satan also came with them to present himself before him and the lord said to satan where have you come from satan answered the lord from roaming through the earth and going back and forth in it then the lord said to satan have you considered my servant job there is no one on earth like him he is blameless and upright a man who fears god and shuns evil and he still maintains his integrity though you incited me against him to ruin him without any reason skin for skin satan replied a man will give all he has for his own life but stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones and he will surely curse you to your face the lord said to satan very well then he is in your hands but you must spare his life so satan went out from the presence of the lord and afflicted job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the top of his head then job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes his wife said to him are you still holding on to your integrity curse god and die he replied you are talking like a foolish woman shall we accept good from god and not trouble in all this job did not sin in what he said when jobs three friends eliphaz the temanite bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite heard about all the troubles that had come upon him they set out from their homes and met together by agreement to go and sympathize with him and comfort him when they saw him from a distance they could hardly recognize him they began to weep aloud and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and seven nights no one said a word to him because they saw how great his suffering was after this job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth he said may the day of my birth perish and the night it was said a boy is born that day may it turn to darkness may god above not care about it may no light shine upon it may darkness and deep shadow claim it once more may a cloud settle over it may blackness overwhelm its light that night may thick darkness seize it may it not be included among the days of the year nor be entered in any of the months may that night be barren may no shout of joy be heard in it may those who curse days curse that day those who are ready to rouse leviathan may its morning stars become dark may it wait for daylight in vain and not see the first rays of dawn for it did not shut the doors of the womb on me to hide trouble from my eyes why did i not perish at birth and die as i came from the womb why were there knees to receive me and breasts that i might be nursed for now i would be lying down in peace i would be asleep and at rest with kings and counselors of the earth who built for themselves places now lying in ruins with rulers who had gold who filled their houses with silver or why was i not hidden in the ground like a stillborn child like an infant who never saw the light of day there the wicked cease from turmoil and there the weary are at rest captives also enjoy their ease they no longer hear the slave drivers shout the small and the great are there and the slave is freed from his master why is light given to those in misery and life to the bitter of soul to those who long for death that does not come who search for it more than for hidden treasure who are filled with gladness and rejoice when they reach the grave why is life given to a man whose way is hidden whom god has hedged in for sighing comes to me instead of food my groans pour out like water what i feared has come upon me what i dreaded has happened to me i have no peace no quietness i have no rest but only turmoil then eliphaz the temanite replied if someone ventures a word with you will you be impatient but who can keep from speaking think how you have instructed many how you have strengthened feeble hands your words have supported those who stumbled you have strengthened faltering knees but now trouble comes to you and you are discouraged it strikes you and you are dismayed should not your piety be your confidence and your blameless ways your hope consider now who being innocent has ever perished where were the upright ever destroyed as i have observed those who plow evil and those who sow trouble reap it at the breath of god they are destroyed at the blast of his anger they perish the lions may roar and growl yet the teeth of the great lions are broken the lion perishes for lack of prey and the cubs of the lioness are scattered a word was secretly brought to me my ears caught a whisper of it amid disquieting dreams in the night when deep sleep falls on men fear and trembling seized me and made all my bones shake a spirit glided past my face and the hair on my body stood on end it stopped but i could not tell what it was a form stood before my eyes and i heard a hushed voice can a mortal be more righteous than god can a man be more pure than his maker if god places no trust in his servants if he charges his angels with error how much more those who live in houses of clay whose foundations are in the dust who are crushed more readily than a moth between dawn and dusk they are broken to pieces unnoticed they perish forever are not the cords of their tent pulled up so that they die without wisdom call if you will but who will answer you to which of the holy ones will you turn resentment kills a fool and envy slays the simple i myself have seen a fool taking root but suddenly his house was cursed his children are far from safety crushed in court without a defender the hungry consume his harvest taking it even from among thorns and the thirsty pant after his wealth for hardship does not spring from the soil nor does trouble sprout from the ground yet man is born to trouble as surely as sparks fly upward but if it were i i would appeal to god i would lay my cause before him he performs wonders that cannot be fathomed miracles that cannot be counted he bestows rain on the earth he sends water upon the countryside the lowly he sets on high and those who mourn are lifted to safety he thwarts the plans of the crafty so that their hands achieve no success he catches the wise in their craftiness and the schemes of the wily are swept away darkness comes upon them in the daytime at noon they grope as in the night he saves the needy from the sword in their mouth he saves them from the clutches of the powerful so the poor have hope and injustice shuts its mouth blessed is the man whom god corrects so do not despise the discipline of the almighty for he wounds but he also binds up he injures but his hands also heal from six calamities he will rescue you in seven no harm will befall you in famine he will ransom you from death and in battle from the stroke of the sword you will be protected from the lash of the tongue and need not fear when destruction comes you will laugh at destruction and famine and need not fear the beasts of the earth for you will have a covenant with the stones of the field and the wild animals will be at peace with you you will know that your tent is secure you will take stock of your property and find nothing missing you will know that your children will be many and your descendants like the grass of the earth you will come to the grave in full vigor like sheaves gathered in season we have examined this and it is true so hear it and apply it to yourself then job replied if only my anguish could be weighed and all my misery be placed on the scales it would surely outweigh the sand of the seas no wonder my words have been impetuous the arrows of the almighty are in me my spirit drinks in their poison gods terrors are marshaled against me does a wild donkey bray when it has grass or an ox bellow when it has fodder is tasteless food eaten without salt or is there flavor in the white of an egg i refuse to touch it such food makes me ill oh that i might have my request that god would grant what i hope for that god would be willing to crush me to let loose his hand and cut me off then i would still have this consolation my joy in unrelenting pain that i had not denied the words of the holy one what strength do i have that i should still hope what prospects that i should be patient do i have the strength of stone is my flesh bronze do i have any power to help myself now that success has been driven from me a despairing man should have the devotion of his friends even though he forsakes the fear of the almighty but my brothers are as undependable as intermittent streams as the streams that overflow when darkened by thawing ice and swollen with melting snow but that cease to flow in the dry season and in the heat vanish from their channels caravans turn aside from their routes they go up into the wasteland and perish the caravans of tema look for water the traveling merchants of sheba look in hope they are distressed because they had been confident they arrive there only to be disappointed now you too have proved to be of no help you see something dreadful and are afraid have i ever said give something on my behalf pay a ransom for me from your wealth deliver me from the hand of the enemy ransom me from the clutches of the ruthless teach me and i will be quiet show me where i have been wrong how painful are honest words but what do your arguments prove do you mean to correct what i say and treat the words of a despairing man as wind you would even cast lots for the fatherless and barter away your friend but now be so kind as to look at me would i lie to your face relent do not be unjust reconsider for my integrity is at stake is there any wickedness on my lips can my mouth not discern malice does not man have hard service on earth are not his days like those of a hired man like a slave longing for the evening shadows or a hired man waiting eagerly for his wages so i have been allotted months of futility and nights of misery have been assigned to me when i lie down i think how long before i get up the night drags on and i toss till dawn my body is clothed with worms and scabs my skin is broken and festering my days are swifter than a weavers shuttle and they come to an end without hope remember o god that my life is but a breath my eyes will never see happiness again the eye that now sees me will see me no longer you will look for me but i will be no more as a cloud vanishes and is gone so he who goes down to the grave does not return he will never come to his house again his place will know him no more therefore i will not keep silent i will speak out in the anguish of my spirit i will complain in the bitterness of my soul am i the sea or the monster of the deep that you put me under guard when i think my bed will comfort me and my couch will ease my complaint even then you frighten me with dreams and terrify me with visions so that i prefer strangling and death rather than this body of mine i despise my life i would not live forever let me alone my days have no meaning what is man that you make so much of him that you give him so much attention that you examine him every morning and test him every moment will you never look away from me or let me alone even for an instant if i have sinned what have i done to you o watcher of men why have you made me your target have i become a burden to you why do you not pardon my offenses and forgive my sins for i will soon lie down in the dust you will search for me but i will be no more then bildad the shuhite replied how long will you say such things your words are a blustering wind does god pervert justice does the almighty pervert what is right when your children sinned against him he gave them over to the penalty of their sin but if you will look to god and plead with the almighty if you are pure and upright even now he will rouse himself on your behalf and restore you to your rightful place your beginnings will seem humble so prosperous will your future be ask the former generations and find out what their fathers learned for we were born only yesterday and know nothing and our days on earth are but a shadow will they not instruct you and tell you will they not bring forth words from their understanding can papyrus grow tall where there is no marsh can reeds thrive without water while still growing and uncut they wither more quickly than grass such is the destiny of all who forget god so perishes the hope of the godless what he trusts in is fragile what he relies on is a spiders web he leans on his web but it gives way he clings to it but it does not hold he is like a well watered plant in the sunshine spreading its shoots over the garden it entwines its roots around a pile of rocks and looks for a place among the stones but when it is torn from its spot that place disowns it and says i never saw you surely its life withers away and from the soil other plants grow surely god does not reject a blameless man or strengthen the hands of evildoers he will yet fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy your enemies will be clothed in shame and the tents of the wicked will be no more then job replied indeed i know that this is true but how can a mortal be righteous before god though one wished to dispute with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand his wisdom is profound his power is vast who has resisted him and come out unscathed he moves mountains without their knowing it and overturns them in his anger he shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble he speaks to the sun and it does not shine he seals off the light of the stars he alone stretches out the heavens and treads on the waves of the sea he is the maker of the bear and orion the pleiades and the constellations of the south he performs wonders that cannot be fathomed miracles that cannot be counted when he passes me i cannot see him when he goes by i cannot perceive him if he snatches away who can stop him who can say to him what are you doing god does not restrain his anger even the cohorts of rahab cowered at his feet how then can i dispute with him how can i find words to argue with him though i were innocent i could not answer him i could only plead with my judge for mercy even if i summoned him and he responded i do not believe he would give me a hearing he would crush me with a storm and multiply my wounds for no reason he would not let me regain my breath but would overwhelm me with misery if it is a matter of strength he is mighty and if it is a matter of justice who will summon him even if i were innocent my mouth would condemn me if i were blameless it would pronounce me guilty although i am blameless i have no concern for myself i despise my own life it is all the same that is why i say he destroys both the blameless and the wicked when a scourge brings sudden death he mocks the despair of the innocent when a land falls into the hands of the wicked he blindfolds its judges if it is not he then who is it my days are swifter than a runner they fly away without a glimpse of joy they skim past like boats of papyrus like eagles swooping down on their prey if i say i will forget my complaint i will change my expression and smile i still dread all my sufferings for i know you will not hold me innocent since i am already found guilty why should i struggle in vain even if i washed myself with soap and my hands with washing soda you would plunge me into a slime pit so that even my clothes would detest me he is not a man like me that i might answer him that we might confront each other in court if only there were someone to arbitrate between us to lay his hand upon us both someone to remove gods rod from me so that his terror would frighten me no more then i would speak up without fear of him but as it now stands with me i cannot i loathe my very life therefore i will give free rein to my complaint and speak out in the bitterness of my soul i will say to god do not condemn me but tell me what charges you have against me does it please you to oppress me to spurn the work of your hands while you smile on the schemes of the wicked do you have eyes of flesh do you see as a mortal sees are your days like those of a mortal or your years like those of a man that you must search out my faults and probe after my sin though you know that i am not guilty and that no one can rescue me from your hand your hands shaped me and made me will you now turn and destroy me remember that you molded me like clay will you now turn me to dust again did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese clothe me with skin and flesh and knit me together with bones and sinews you gave me life and showed me kindness and in your providence watched over my spirit but this is what you concealed in your heart and i know that this was in your mind if i sinned you would be watching me and would not let my offense go unpunished if i am guilty woe to me even if i am innocent i cannot lift my head for i am full of shame and drowned in my affliction if i hold my head high you stalk me like a lion and again display your awesome power against me you bring new witnesses against me and increase your anger toward me your forces come against me wave upon wave why then did you bring me out of the womb i wish i had died before any eye saw me if only i had never come into being or had been carried straight from the womb to the grave are not my few days almost over turn away from me so i can have a moments joy before i go to the place of no return to the land of gloom and deep shadow to the land of deepest night of deep shadow and disorder where even the light is like darkness then zophar the naamathite replied are all these words to go unanswered is this talker to be vindicated will your idle talk reduce men to silence will no one rebuke you when you mock you say to god my beliefs are flawless and i am pure in your sight oh how i wish that god would speak that he would open his lips against you and disclose to you the secrets of wisdom for true wisdom has two sides know this god has even forgotten some of your sin can you fathom the mysteries of god can you probe the limits of the almighty they are higher than the heavens what can you do they are deeper than the depths of the grave what can you know their measure is longer than the earth and wider than the sea if he comes along and confines you in prison and convenes a court who can oppose him surely he recognizes deceitful men and when he sees evil does he not take note but a witless man can no more become wise than a wild donkeys colt can be born a man yet if you devote your heart to him and stretch out your hands to him if you put away the sin that is in your hand and allow no evil to dwell in your tent then you will lift up your face without shame you will stand firm and without fear you will surely forget your trouble recalling it only as waters gone by life will be brighter than noonday and darkness will become like morning you will be secure because there is hope you will look about you and take your rest in safety you will lie down with no one to make you afraid and many will court your favor but the eyes of the wicked will fail and escape will elude them their hope will become a dying gasp then job replied doubtless you are the people and wisdom will die with you but i have a mind as well as you i am not inferior to you who does not know all these things i have become a laughingstock to my friends though i called upon god and he answered a mere laughingstock though righteous and blameless men at ease have contempt for misfortune as the fate of those whose feet are slipping the tents of marauders are undisturbed and those who provoke god are secure those who carry their god in their hands but ask the animals and they will teach you or the birds of the air and they will tell you or speak to the earth and it will teach you or let the fish of the sea inform you which of all these does not know that the hand of the lord has done this in his hand is the life of every creature and the breath of all mankind does not the ear test words as the tongue tastes food is not wisdom found among the aged does not long life bring understanding to god belong wisdom and power counsel and understanding are his what he tears down cannot be rebuilt the man he imprisons cannot be released if he holds back the waters there is drought if he lets them loose they devastate the land to him belong strength and victory both deceived and deceiver are his he leads counselors away stripped and makes fools of judges he takes off the shackles put on by kings and ties a loincloth around their waist he leads priests away stripped and overthrows men long established he silences the lips of trusted advisers and takes away the discernment of elders he pours contempt on nobles and disarms the mighty he reveals the deep things of darkness and brings deep shadows into the light he makes nations great and destroys them he enlarges nations and disperses them he deprives the leaders of the earth of their reason he sends them wandering through a trackless waste they grope in darkness with no light he makes them stagger like drunkards my eyes have seen all this my ears have heard and understood it what you know i also know i am not inferior to you but i desire to speak to the almighty and to argue my case with god you however smear me with lies you are worthless physicians all of you if only you would be altogether silent for you that would be wisdom hear now my argument listen to the plea of my lips will you speak wickedly on gods behalf will you speak deceitfully for him will you show him partiality will you argue the case for god would it turn out well if he examined you could you deceive him as you might deceive men he would surely rebuke you if you secretly showed partiality would not his splendor terrify you would not the dread of him fall on you your maxims are proverbs of ashes your defenses are defenses of clay keep silent and let me speak then let come to me what may why do i put myself in jeopardy and take my life in my hands though he slay me yet will i hope in him i will surely defend my ways to his face indeed this will turn out for my deliverance for no godless man would dare come before him listen carefully to my words let your ears take in what i say now that i have prepared my case i know i will be vindicated can anyone bring charges against me if so i will be silent and die only grant me these two things o god and then i will not hide from you withdraw your hand far from me and stop frightening me with your terrors then summon me and i will answer or let me speak and you reply how many wrongs and sins have i committed show me my offense and my sin why do you hide your face and consider me your enemy will you torment a windblown leaf will you chase after dry chaff for you write down bitter things against me and make me inherit the sins of my youth you fasten my feet in shackles you keep close watch on all my paths by putting marks on the soles of my feet so man wastes away like something rotten like a garment eaten by moths man born of woman is of few days and full of trouble he springs up like a flower and withers away like a fleeting shadow he does not endure do you fix your eye on such a one will you bring him before you for judgment who can bring what is pure from the impure no one mans days are determined you have decreed the number of his months and have set limits he cannot exceed so look away from him and let him alone till he has put in his time like a hired man at least there is hope for a tree if it is cut down it will sprout again and its new shoots will not fail its roots may grow old in the ground and its stump die in the soil yet at the scent of water it will bud and put forth shoots like a plant but man dies and is laid low he breathes his last and is no more as water disappears from the sea or a riverbed becomes parched and dry so man lies down and does not rise till the heavens are no more men will not awake or be roused from their sleep if only you would hide me in the grave and conceal me till your anger has passed if only you would set me a time and then remember me if a man dies will he live again all the days of my hard service i will wait for my renewal to come you will call and i will answer you you will long for the creature your hands have made surely then you will count my steps but not keep track of my sin my offenses will be sealed up in a bag you will cover over my sin but as a mountain erodes and crumbles and as a rock is moved from its place as water wears away stones and torrents wash away the soil so you destroy mans hope you overpower him once for all and he is gone you change his countenance and send him away if his sons are honored he does not know it if they are brought low he does not see it he feels but the pain of his own body and mourns only for himself then eliphaz the temanite replied would a wise man answer with empty notions or fill his belly with the hot east wind would he argue with useless words with speeches that have no value but you even undermine piety and hinder devotion to god your sin prompts your mouth you adopt the tongue of the crafty your own mouth condemns you not mine your own lips testify against you are you the first man ever born were you brought forth before the hills do you listen in on gods council do you limit wisdom to yourself what do you know that we do not know what insights do you have that we do not have the gray haired and the aged are on our side men even older than your father are gods consolations not enough for you words spoken gently to you why has your heart carried you away and why do your eyes flash so that you vent your rage against god and pour out such words from your mouth what is man that he could be pure or one born of woman that he could be righteous if god places no trust in his holy ones if even the heavens are not pure in his eyes how much less man who is vile and corrupt who drinks up evil like water listen to me and i will explain to you let me tell you what i have seen what wise men have declared hiding nothing received from their fathers to whom alone the land was given when no alien passed among them all his days the wicked man suffers torment the ruthless through all the years stored up for him terrifying sounds fill his ears when all seems well marauders attack him he despairs of escaping the darkness he is marked for the sword he wanders about food for vultures he knows the day of darkness is at hand distress and anguish fill him with terror they overwhelm him like a king poised to attack because he shakes his fist at god and vaunts himself against the almighty defiantly charging against him with a thick strong shield though his face is covered with fat and his waist bulges with flesh he will inhabit ruined towns and houses where no one lives houses crumbling to rubble he will no longer be rich and his wealth will not endure nor will his possessions spread over the land he will not escape the darkness a flame will wither his shoots and the breath of gods mouth will carry him away let him not deceive himself by trusting what is worthless for he will get nothing in return before his time he will be paid in full and his branches will not flourish he will be like a vine stripped of its unripe grapes like an olive tree shedding its blossoms for the company of the godless will be barren and fire will consume the tents of those who love bribes they conceive trouble and give birth to evil their womb fashions deceit then job replied i have heard many things like these miserable comforters are you all will your long winded speeches never end what ails you that you keep on arguing i also could speak like you if you were in my place i could make fine speeches against you and shake my head at you but my mouth would encourage you comfort from my lips would bring you relief yet if i speak my pain is not relieved and if i refrain it does not go away surely o god you have worn me out you have devastated my entire household you have bound me and it has become a witness my gauntness rises up and testifies against me god assails me and tears me in his anger and gnashes his teeth at me my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes men open their mouths to jeer at me they strike my cheek in scorn and unite together against me god has turned me over to evil men and thrown me into the clutches of the wicked all was well with me but he shattered me he seized me by the neck and crushed me he has made me his target his archers surround me without pity he pierces my kidneys and spills my gall on the ground again and again he bursts upon me he rushes at me like a warrior i have sewed sackcloth over my skin and buried my brow in the dust my face is red with weeping deep shadows ring my eyes yet my hands have been free of violence and my prayer is pure o earth do not cover my blood may my cry never be laid to rest even now my witness is in heaven my advocate is on high my intercessor is my friend as my eyes pour out tears to god on behalf of a man he pleads with god as a man pleads for his friend only a few years will pass before i go on the journey of no return my spirit is broken my days are cut short the grave awaits me surely mockers surround me my eyes must dwell on their hostility give me o god the pledge you demand who else will put up security for me you have closed their minds to understanding therefore you will not let them triumph if a man denounces his friends for reward the eyes of his children will fail god has made me a byword to everyone a man in whose face people spit my eyes have grown dim with grief my whole frame is but a shadow upright men are appalled at this the innocent are aroused against the ungodly nevertheless the righteous will hold to their ways and those with clean hands will grow stronger but come on all of you try again i will not find a wise man among you my days have passed my plans are shattered and so are the desires of my heart these men turn night into day in the face of darkness they say light is near if the only home i hope for is the grave if i spread out my bed in darkness if i say to corruption you are my father and to the worm my mother or my sister where then is my hope who can see any hope for me will it go down to the gates of death will we descend together into the dust then bildad the shuhite replied when will you end these speeches be sensible and then we can talk why are we regarded as cattle and considered stupid in your sight you who tear yourself to pieces in your anger is the earth to be abandoned for your sake or must the rocks be moved from their place the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out the flame of his fire stops burning the light in his tent becomes dark the lamp beside him goes out the vigor of his step is weakened his own schemes throw him down his feet thrust him into a net and he wanders into its mesh a trap seizes him by the heel a snare holds him fast a noose is hidden for him on the ground a trap lies in his path terrors startle him on every side and dog his every step calamity is hungry for him disaster is ready for him when he falls it eats away parts of his skin deaths firstborn devours his limbs he is torn from the security of his tent and marched off to the king of terrors fire resides in his tent burning sulfur is scattered over his dwelling his roots dry up below and his branches wither above the memory of him perishes from the earth he has no name in the land he is driven from light into darkness and is banished from the world he has no offspring or descendants among his people no survivor where once he lived men of the west are appalled at his fate men of the east are seized with horror surely such is the dwelling of an evil man such is the place of one who knows not god then job replied how long will you torment me and crush me with words ten times now you have reproached me shamelessly you attack me if it is true that i have gone astray my error remains my concern alone if indeed you would exalt yourselves above me and use my humiliation against me then know that god has wronged me and drawn his net around me though i cry ive been wronged i get no response though i call for help there is no justice he has blocked my way so i cannot pass he has shrouded my paths in darkness he has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head he tears me down on every side till i am gone he uproots my hope like a tree his anger burns against me he counts me among his enemies his troops advance in force they build a siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent he has alienated my brothers from me my acquaintances are completely estranged from me my kinsmen have gone away my friends have forgotten me my guests and my maidservants count me a stranger they look upon me as an alien i summon my servant but he does not answer though i beg him with my own mouth my breath is offensive to my wife i am loathsome to my own brothers even the little boys scorn me when i appear they ridicule me all my intimate friends detest me those i love have turned against me i am nothing but skin and bones i have escaped with only the skin of my teeth have pity on me my friends have pity for the hand of god has struck me why do you pursue me as god does will you never get enough of my flesh oh that my words were recorded that they were written on a scroll that they were inscribed with an iron tool on lead or engraved in rock forever i know that my redeemer lives and that in the end he will stand upon the earth and after my skin has been destroyed yet in my flesh i will see god i myself will see him with my own eyes i and not another how my heart yearns within me if you say how we will hound him since the root of the trouble lies in him you should fear the sword yourselves for wrath will bring punishment by the sword and then you will know that there is judgment then zophar the naamathite replied my troubled thoughts prompt me to answer because i am greatly disturbed i hear a rebuke that dishonors me and my understanding inspires me to reply surely you know how it has been from of old ever since man was placed on the earth that the mirth of the wicked is brief the joy of the godless lasts but a moment though his pride reaches to the heavens and his head touches the clouds he will perish forever like his own dung those who have seen him will say where is he like a dream he flies away no more to be found banished like a vision of the night the eye that saw him will not see him again his place will look on him no more his children must make amends to the poor his own hands must give back his wealth the youthful vigor that fills his bones will lie with him in the dust though evil is sweet in his mouth and he hides it under his tongue though he cannot bear to let it go and keeps it in his mouth yet his food will turn sour in his stomach it will become the venom of serpents within him he will spit out the riches he swallowed god will make his stomach vomit them up he will suck the poison of serpents the fangs of an adder will kill him he will not enjoy the streams the rivers flowing with honey and cream what he toiled for he must give back uneaten he will not enjoy the profit from his trading for he has oppressed the poor and left them destitute he has seized houses he did not build surely he will have no respite from his craving he cannot save himself by his treasure nothing is left for him to devour his prosperity will not endure in the midst of his plenty distress will overtake him the full force of misery will come upon him when he has filled his belly god will vent his burning anger against him and rain down his blows upon him though he flees from an iron weapon a bronze tipped arrow pierces him he pulls it out of his back the gleaming point out of his liver terrors will come over him total darkness lies in wait for his treasures a fire unfanned will consume him and devour what is left in his tent the heavens will expose his guilt the earth will rise up against him a flood will carry off his house rushing waters on the day of gods wrath such is the fate god allots the wicked the heritage appointed for them by god then job replied listen carefully to my words let this be the consolation you give me bear with me while i speak and after i have spoken mock on is my complaint directed to man why should i not be impatient look at me and be astonished clap your hand over your mouth when i think about this i am terrified trembling seizes my body why do the wicked live on growing old and increasing in power they see their children established around them their offspring before their eyes their homes are safe and free from fear the rod of god is not upon them their bulls never fail to breed their cows calve and do not miscarry they send forth their children as a flock their little ones dance about they sing to the music of tambourine and harp they make merry to the sound of the flute they spend their years in prosperity and go down to the grave in peace yet they say to god leave us alone we have no desire to know your ways who is the almighty that we should serve him what would we gain by praying to him but their prosperity is not in their own hands so i stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked yet how often is the lamp of the wicked snuffed out how often does calamity come upon them the fate god allots in his anger how often are they like straw before the wind like chaff swept away by a gale it is said god stores up a mans punishment for his sons let him repay the man himself so that he will know it let his own eyes see his destruction let him drink of the wrath of the almighty for what does he care about the family he leaves behind when his allotted months come to an end can anyone teach knowledge to god since he judges even the highest one man dies in full vigor completely secure and at ease his body well nourished his bones rich with marrow another man dies in bitterness of soul never having enjoyed anything good side by side they lie in the dust and worms cover them both i know full well what you are thinking the schemes by which you would wrong me you say where now is the great mans house the tents where wicked men lived have you never questioned those who travel have you paid no regard to their accounts that the evil man is spared from the day of calamity that he is delivered from the day of wrath who denounces his conduct to his face who repays him for what he has done he is carried to the grave and watch is kept over his tomb the soil in the valley is sweet to him all men follow after him and a countless throng goes before him so how can you console me with your nonsense nothing is left of your answers but falsehood then eliphaz the temanite replied can a man be of benefit to god can even a wise man benefit him what pleasure would it give the almighty if you were righteous what would he gain if your ways were blameless is it for your piety that he rebukes you and brings charges against you is not your wickedness great are not your sins endless you demanded security from your brothers for no reason you stripped men of their clothing leaving them naked you gave no water to the weary and you withheld food from the hungry though you were a powerful man owning land an honored man living on it and you sent widows away empty handed and broke the strength of the fatherless that is why snares are all around you why sudden peril terrifies you why it is so dark you cannot see and why a flood of water covers you is not god in the heights of heaven and see how lofty are the highest stars yet you say what does god know does he judge through such darkness thick clouds veil him so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens will you keep to the old path that evil men have trod they were carried off before their time their foundations washed away by a flood they said to god leave us alone what can the almighty do to us yet it was he who filled their houses with good things so i stand aloof from the counsel of the wicked the righteous see their ruin and rejoice the innocent mock them saying surely our foes are destroyed and fire devours their wealth submit to god and be at peace with him in this way prosperity will come to you accept instruction from his mouth and lay up his words in your heart if you return to the almighty you will be restored if you remove wickedness far from your tent and assign your nuggets to the dust your gold of ophir to the rocks in the ravines then the almighty will be your gold the choicest silver for you surely then you will find delight in the almighty and will lift up your face to god you will pray to him and he will hear you and you will fulfill your vows what you decide on will be done and light will shine on your ways when men are brought low and you say lift them up then he will save the downcast he will deliver even one who is not innocent who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands then job replied even today my complaint is bitter his hand is heavy in spite of my groaning if only i knew where to find him if only i could go to his dwelling i would state my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments i would find out what he would answer me and consider what he would say would he oppose me with great power no he would not press charges against me there an upright man could present his case before him and i would be delivered forever from my judge but if i go to the east he is not there if i go to the west i do not find him when he is at work in the north i do not see him when he turns to the south i catch no glimpse of him but he knows the way that i take when he has tested me i will come forth as gold my feet have closely followed his steps i have kept to his way without turning aside i have not departed from the commands of his lips i have treasured the words of his mouth more than my daily bread but he stands alone and who can oppose him he does whatever he pleases he carries out his decree against me and many such plans he still has in store that is why i am terrified before him when i think of all this i fear him god has made my heart faint the almighty has terrified me yet i am not silenced by the darkness by the thick darkness that covers my face why does the almighty not set times for judgment why must those who know him look in vain for such days men move boundary stones they pasture flocks they have stolen they drive away the orphans donkey and take the widows ox in pledge they thrust the needy from the path and force all the poor of the land into hiding like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go about their labor of foraging food the wasteland provides food for their children they gather fodder in the fields and glean in the vineyards of the wicked lacking clothes they spend the night naked they have nothing to cover themselves in the cold they are drenched by mountain rains and hug the rocks for lack of shelter the fatherless child is snatched from the breast the infant of the poor is seized for a debt lacking clothes they go about naked they carry the sheaves but still go hungry they crush olives among the terraces they tread the winepresses yet suffer thirst the groans of the dying rise from the city and the souls of the wounded cry out for help but god charges no one with wrongdoing there are those who rebel against the light who do not know its ways or stay in its paths when daylight is gone the murderer rises up and kills the poor and needy in the night he steals forth like a thief the eye of the adulterer watches for dusk he thinks no eye will see me and he keeps his face concealed in the dark men break into houses but by day they shut themselves in they want nothing to do with the light for all of them deep darkness is their morning they make friends with the terrors of darkness yet they are foam on the surface of the water their portion of the land is cursed so that no one goes to the vineyards as heat and drought snatch away the melted snow so the grave snatches away those who have sinned the womb forgets them the worm feasts on them evil men are no longer remembered but are broken like a tree they prey on the barren and childless woman and to the widow show no kindness but god drags away the mighty by his power though they become established they have no assurance of life he may let them rest in a feeling of security but his eyes are on their ways for a little while they are exalted and then they are gone they are brought low and gathered up like all others they are cut off like heads of grain if this is not so who can prove me false and reduce my words to nothing then bildad the shuhite replied dominion and awe belong to god he establishes order in the heights of heaven can his forces be numbered upon whom does his light not rise how then can a man be righteous before god how can one born of woman be pure if even the moon is not bright and the stars are not pure in his eyes how much less man who is but a maggot a son of man who is only a worm then job replied how you have helped the powerless how you have saved the arm that is feeble what advice you have offered to one without wisdom and what great insight you have displayed who has helped you utter these words and whose spirit spoke from your mouth the dead are in deep anguish those beneath the waters and all that live in them death is naked before god destruction lies uncovered he spreads out the northern skies over empty space he suspends the earth over nothing he wraps up the waters in his clouds yet the clouds do not burst under their weight he covers the face of the full moon spreading his clouds over it he marks out the horizon on the face of the waters for a boundary between light and darkness the pillars of the heavens quake aghast at his rebuke by his power he churned up the sea by his wisdom he cut rahab to pieces by his breath the skies became fair his hand pierced the gliding serpent and these are but the outer fringe of his works how faint the whisper we hear of him who then can understand the thunder of his power and job continued his discourse as surely as god lives who has denied me justice the almighty who has made me taste bitterness of soul as long as i have life within me the breath of god in my nostrils my lips will not speak wickedness and my tongue will utter no deceit i will never admit you are in the right till i die i will not deny my integrity i will maintain my righteousness and never let go of it my conscience will not reproach me as long as i live may my enemies be like the wicked my adversaries like the unjust for what hope has the godless when he is cut off when god takes away his life does god listen to his cry when distress comes upon him will he find delight in the almighty will he call upon god at all times i will teach you about the power of god the ways of the almighty i will not conceal you have all seen this yourselves why then this meaningless talk here is the fate god allots to the wicked the heritage a ruthless man receives from the almighty however many his children their fate is the sword his offspring will never have enough to eat the plague will bury those who survive him and their widows will not weep for them though he heaps up silver like dust and clothes like piles of clay what he lays up the righteous will wear and the innocent will divide his silver the house he builds is like a moths cocoon like a hut made by a watchman he lies down wealthy but will do so no more when he opens his eyes all is gone terrors overtake him like a flood a tempest snatches him away in the night the east wind carries him off and he is gone it sweeps him out of his place it hurls itself against him without mercy as he flees headlong from its power it claps its hands in derision and hisses him out of his place there is a mine for silver and a place where gold is refined iron is taken from the earth and copper is smelted from ore man puts an end to the darkness he searches the farthest recesses for ore in the blackest darkness far from where people dwell he cuts a shaft in places forgotten by the foot of man far from men he dangles and sways the earth from which food comes is transformed below as by fire sapphires come from its rocks and its dust contains nuggets of gold no bird of prey knows that hidden path no falcons eye has seen it proud beasts do not set foot on it and no lion prowls there mans hand assaults the flinty rock and lays bare the roots of the mountains he tunnels through the rock his eyes see all its treasures he searches the sources of the rivers and brings hidden things to light but where can wisdom be found where does understanding dwell man does not comprehend its worth it cannot be found in the land of the living the deep says it is not in me the sea says it is not with me it cannot be bought with the finest gold nor can its price be weighed in silver it cannot be bought with the gold of ophir with precious onyx or sapphires neither gold nor crystal can compare with it nor can it be had for jewels of gold coral and jasper are not worthy of mention the price of wisdom is beyond rubies the topaz of cush cannot compare with it it cannot be bought with pure gold where then does wisdom come from where does understanding dwell it is hidden from the eyes of every living thing concealed even from the birds of the air destruction and death say only a rumor of it has reached our ears god understands the way to it and he alone knows where it dwells for he views the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens when he established the force of the wind and measured out the waters when he made a decree for the rain and a path for the thunderstorm then he looked at wisdom and appraised it he confirmed it and tested it and he said to man the fear of the lord that is wisdom and to shun evil is understanding job continued his discourse how i long for the months gone by for the days when god watched over me when his lamp shone upon my head and by his light i walked through darkness oh for the days when i was in my prime when gods intimate friendship blessed my house when the almighty was still with me and my children were around me when my path was drenched with cream and the rock poured out for me streams of olive oil when i went to the gate of the city and took my seat in the public square the young men saw me and stepped aside and the old men rose to their feet the chief men refrained from speaking and covered their mouths with their hands the voices of the nobles were hushed and their tongues stuck to the roof of their mouths whoever heard me spoke well of me and those who saw me commended me because i rescued the poor who cried for help and the fatherless who had none to assist him the man who was dying blessed me i made the widows heart sing i put on righteousness as my clothing justice was my robe and my turban i was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame i was a father to the needy i took up the case of the stranger i broke the fangs of the wicked and snatched the victims from their teeth i thought i will die in my own house my days as numerous as the grains of sand my roots will reach to the water and the dew will lie all night on my branches my glory will remain fresh in me the bow ever new in my hand men listened to me expectantly waiting in silence for my counsel after i had spoken they spoke no more my words fell gently on their ears they waited for me as for showers and drank in my words as the spring rain when i smiled at them they scarcely believed it the light of my face was precious to them i chose the way for them and sat as their chief i dwelt as a king among his troops i was like one who comforts mourners but now they mock me men younger than i whose fathers i would have disdained to put with my sheep dogs of what use was the strength of their hands to me since their vigor had gone from them haggard from want and hunger they roamed the parched land in desolate wastelands at night in the brush they gathered salt herbs and their food was the root of the broom tree they were banished from their fellow men shouted at as if they were thieves they were forced to live in the dry stream beds among the rocks and in holes in the ground they brayed among the bushes and huddled in the undergrowth a base and nameless brood they were driven out of the land and now their sons mock me in song i have become a byword among them they detest me and keep their distance they do not hesitate to spit in my face now that god has unstrung my bow and afflicted me they throw off restraint in my presence on my right the tribe attacks they lay snares for my feet they build their siege ramps against me they break up my road they succeed in destroying me without anyones helping them they advance as through a gaping breach amid the ruins they come rolling in terrors overwhelm me my dignity is driven away as by the wind my safety vanishes like a cloud and now my life ebbs away days of suffering grip me night pierces my bones my gnawing pains never rest in his great power god becomes like clothing to me he binds me like the neck of my garment he throws me into the mud and i am reduced to dust and ashes i cry out to you o god but you do not answer i stand up but you merely look at me you turn on me ruthlessly with the might of your hand you attack me you snatch me up and drive me before the wind you toss me about in the storm i know you will bring me down to death to the place appointed for all the living surely no one lays a hand on a broken man when he cries for help in his distress have i not wept for those in trouble has not my soul grieved for the poor yet when i hoped for good evil came when i looked for light then came darkness the churning inside me never stops days of suffering confront me i go about blackened but not by the sun i stand up in the assembly and cry for help i have become a brother of jackals a companion of owls my skin grows black and peels my body burns with fever my harp is tuned to mourning and my flute to the sound of wailing i made a covenant with my eyes not to look lustfully at a girl for what is mans lot from god above his heritage from the almighty on high is it not ruin for the wicked disaster for those who do wrong does he not see my ways and count my every step if i have walked in falsehood or my foot has hurried after deceit let god weigh me in honest scales and he will know that i am blameless if my steps have turned from the path if my heart has been led by my eyes or if my hands have been defiled then may others eat what i have sown and may my crops be uprooted if my heart has been enticed by a woman or if i have lurked at my neighbors door then may my wife grind another mans grain and may other men sleep with her for that would have been shameful a sin to be judged it is a fire that burns to destruction it would have uprooted my harvest if i have denied justice to my menservants and maidservants when they had a grievance against me what will i do when god confronts me what will i answer when called to account did not he who made me in the womb make them did not the same one form us both within our mothers if i have denied the desires of the poor or let the eyes of the widow grow weary if i have kept my bread to myself not sharing it with the fatherless but from my youth i reared him as would a father and from my birth i guided the widow if i have seen anyone perishing for lack of clothing or a needy man without a garment and his heart did not bless me for warming him with the fleece from my sheep if i have raised my hand against the fatherless knowing that i had influence in court then let my arm fall from the shoulder let it be broken off at the joint for i dreaded destruction from god and for fear of his splendor i could not do such things if i have put my trust in gold or said to pure gold you are my security if i have rejoiced over my great wealth the fortune my hands had gained if i have regarded the sun in its radiance or the moon moving in splendor so that my heart was secretly enticed and my hand offered them a kiss of homage then these also would be sins to be judged for i would have been unfaithful to god on high if i have rejoiced at my enemys misfortune or gloated over the trouble that came to him i have not allowed my mouth to sin by invoking a curse against his life if the men of my household have never said who has not had his fill of jobs meat but no stranger had to spend the night in the street for my door was always open to the traveler if i have concealed my sin as men do by hiding my guilt in my heart because i so feared the crowd and so dreaded the contempt of the clans that i kept silent and would not go outside oh that i had someone to hear me i sign now my defense let the almighty answer me let my accuser put his indictment in writing surely i would wear it on my shoulder i would put it on like a crown i would give him an account of my every step like a prince i would approach him if my land cries out against me and all its furrows are wet with tears if i have devoured its yield without payment or broken the spirit of its tenants then let briers come up instead of wheat and weeds instead of barley the words of job are ended so these three men stopped answering job because he was righteous in his own eyes but elihu son of barakel the buzite of the family of ram became very angry with job for justifying himself rather than god he was also angry with the three friends because they had found no way to refute job and yet had condemned him now elihu had waited before speaking to job because they were older than he but when he saw that the three men had nothing more to say his anger was aroused so elihu son of barakel the buzite said i am young in years and you are old that is why i was fearful not daring to tell you what i know i thought age should speak advanced years should teach wisdom but it is the spirit in a man the breath of the almighty that gives him understanding it is not only the old who are wise not only the aged who understand what is right therefore i say listen to me i too will tell you what i know i waited while you spoke i listened to your reasoning while you were searching for words i gave you my full attention but not one of you has proved job wrong none of you has answered his arguments do not say we have found wisdom let god refute him not man but job has not marshaled his words against me and i will not answer him with your arguments they are dismayed and have no more to say words have failed them must i wait now that they are silent now that they stand there with no reply i too will have my say i too will tell what i know for i am full of words and the spirit within me compels me inside i am like bottled up wine like new wineskins ready to burst i must speak and find relief i must open my lips and reply i will show partiality to no one nor will i flatter any man for if i were skilled in flattery my maker would soon take me away but now job listen to my words pay attention to everything i say i am about to open my mouth my words are on the tip of my tongue my words come from an upright heart my lips sincerely speak what i know the spirit of god has made me the breath of the almighty gives me life answer me then if you can prepare yourself and confront me i am just like you before god i too have been taken from clay no fear of me should alarm you nor should my hand be heavy upon you but you have said in my hearing i heard the very words i am pure and without sin i am clean and free from guilt yet god has found fault with me he considers me his enemy he fastens my feet in shackles he keeps close watch on all my paths but i tell you in this you are not right for god is greater than man why do you complain to him that he answers none of mans words for god does speak now one way now another though man may not perceive it in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falls on men as they slumber in their beds he may speak in their ears and terrify them with warnings to turn man from wrongdoing and keep him from pride to preserve his soul from the pit his life from perishing by the sword or a man may be chastened on a bed of pain with constant distress in his bones so that his very being finds food repulsive and his soul loathes the choicest meal his flesh wastes away to nothing and his bones once hidden now stick out his soul draws near to the pit and his life to the messengers of death yet if there is an angel on his side as a mediator one out of a thousand to tell a man what is right for him to be gracious to him and say spare him from going down to the pit i have found a ransom for him then his flesh is renewed like a childs it is restored as in the days of his youth he prays to god and finds favor with him he sees gods face and shouts for joy he is restored by god to his righteous state then he comes to men and says i sinned and perverted what was right but i did not get what i deserved he redeemed my soul from going down to the pit and i will live to enjoy the light god does all these things to a man twice even three times to turn back his soul from the pit that the light of life may shine on him pay attention job and listen to me be silent and i will speak if you have anything to say answer me speak up for i want you to be cleared but if not then listen to me be silent and i will teach you wisdom then elihu said hear my words you wise men listen to me you men of learning for the ear tests words as the tongue tastes food let us discern for ourselves what is right let us learn together what is good job says i am innocent but god denies me justice although i am right i am considered a liar although i am guiltless his arrow inflicts an incurable wound what man is like job who drinks scorn like water he keeps company with evildoers he associates with wicked men for he says it profits a man nothing when he tries to please god so listen to me you men of understanding far be it from god to do evil from the almighty to do wrong he repays a man for what he has done he brings upon him what his conduct deserves it is unthinkable that god would do wrong that the almighty would pervert justice who appointed him over the earth who put him in charge of the whole world if it were his intention and he withdrew his spirit and breath all mankind would perish together and man would return to the dust if you have understanding hear this listen to what i say can he who hates justice govern will you condemn the just and mighty one is he not the one who says to kings you are worthless and to nobles you are wicked who shows no partiality to princes and does not favor the rich over the poor for they are all the work of his hands they die in an instant in the middle of the night the people are shaken and they pass away the mighty are removed without human hand his eyes are on the ways of men he sees their every step there is no dark place no deep shadow where evildoers can hide god has no need to examine men further that they should come before him for judgment without inquiry he shatters the mighty and sets up others in their place because he takes note of their deeds he overthrows them in the night and they are crushed he punishes them for their wickedness where everyone can see them because they turned from following him and had no regard for any of his ways they caused the cry of the poor to come before him so that he heard the cry of the needy but if he remains silent who can condemn him if he hides his face who can see him yet he is over man and nation alike to keep a godless man from ruling from laying snares for the people suppose a man says to god i am guilty but will offend no more teach me what i cannot see if i have done wrong i will not do so again should god then reward you on your terms when you refuse to repent you must decide not i so tell me what you know men of understanding declare wise men who hear me say to me job speaks without knowledge his words lack insight oh that job might be tested to the utmost for answering like a wicked man to his sin he adds rebellion scornfully he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against god then elihu said do you think this is just you say i will be cleared by god yet you ask him what profit is it to me and what do i gain by not sinning i would like to reply to you and to your friends with you look up at the heavens and see gaze at the clouds so high above you if you sin how does that affect him if your sins are many what does that do to him if you are righteous what do you give to him or what does he receive from your hand your wickedness affects only a man like yourself and your righteousness only the sons of men men cry out under a load of oppression they plead for relief from the arm of the powerful but no one says where is god my maker who gives songs in the night who teaches more to us than to the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the air he does not answer when men cry out because of the arrogance of the wicked indeed god does not listen to their empty plea the almighty pays no attention to it how much less then will he listen when you say that you do not see him that your case is before him and you must wait for him and further that his anger never punishes and he does not take the least notice of wickedness so job opens his mouth with empty talk without knowledge he multiplies words elihu continued bear with me a little longer and i will show you that there is more to be said in gods behalf i get my knowledge from afar i will ascribe justice to my maker be assured that my words are not false one perfect in knowledge is with you god is mighty but does not despise men he is mighty and firm in his purpose he does not keep the wicked alive but gives the afflicted their rights he does not take his eyes off the righteous he enthrones them with kings and exalts them forever but if men are bound in chains held fast by cords of affliction he tells them what they have done that they have sinned arrogantly he makes them listen to correction and commands them to repent of their evil if they obey and serve him they will spend the rest of their days in prosperity and their years in contentment but if they do not listen they will perish by the sword and die without knowledge the godless in heart harbor resentment even when he fetters them they do not cry for help they die in their youth among male prostitutes of the shrines but those who suffer he delivers in their suffering he speaks to them in their affliction he is wooing you from the jaws of distress to a spacious place free from restriction to the comfort of your table laden with choice food but now you are laden with the judgment due the wicked judgment and justice have taken hold of you be careful that no one entices you by riches do not let a large bribe turn you aside would your wealth or even all your mighty efforts sustain you so you would not be in distress do not long for the night to drag people away from their homes beware of turning to evil which you seem to prefer to affliction god is exalted in his power who is a teacher like him who has prescribed his ways for him or said to him you have done wrong remember to extol his work which men have praised in song all mankind has seen it men gaze on it from afar how great is god beyond our understanding the number of his years is past finding out he draws up the drops of water which distill as rain to the streams the clouds pour down their moisture and abundant showers fall on mankind who can understand how he spreads out the clouds how he thunders from his pavilion see how he scatters his lightning about him bathing the depths of the sea this is the way he governs the nations and provides food in abundance he fills his hands with lightning and commands it to strike its mark his thunder announces the coming storm even the cattle make known its approach at this my heart pounds and leaps from its place listen listen to the roar of his voice to the rumbling that comes from his mouth he unleashes his lightning beneath the whole heaven and sends it to the ends of the earth after that comes the sound of his roar he thunders with his majestic voice when his voice resounds he holds nothing back gods voice thunders in marvelous ways he does great things beyond our understanding he says to the snow fall on the earth and to the rain shower be a mighty downpour so that all men he has made may know his work he stops every man from his labor the animals take cover they remain in their dens the tempest comes out from its chamber the cold from the driving winds the breath of god produces ice and the broad waters become frozen he loads the clouds with moisture he scatters his lightning through them at his direction they swirl around over the face of the whole earth to do whatever he commands them he brings the clouds to punish men or to water his earth and show his love listen to this job stop and consider gods wonders do you know how god controls the clouds and makes his lightning flash do you know how the clouds hang poised those wonders of him who is perfect in knowledge you who swelter in your clothes when the land lies hushed under the south wind can you join him in spreading out the skies hard as a mirror of cast bronze tell us what we should say to him we cannot draw up our case because of our darkness should he be told that i want to speak would any man ask to be swallowed up now no one can look at the sun bright as it is in the skies after the wind has swept them clean out of the north he comes in golden splendor god comes in awesome majesty the almighty is beyond our reach and exalted in power in his justice and great righteousness he does not oppress therefore men revere him for does he not have regard for all the wise in heart then the lord answered job out of the storm he said who is this that darkens my counsel with words without knowledge brace yourself like a man i will question you and you shall answer me where were you when i laid the earths foundation tell me if you understand who marked off its dimensions surely you know who stretched a measuring line across it on what were its footings set or who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy who shut up the sea behind doors when it burst forth from the womb when i made the clouds its garment and wrapped it in thick darkness when i fixed limits for it and set its doors and bars in place when i said this far you may come and no farther here is where your proud waves halt have you ever given orders to the morning or shown the dawn its place that it might take the earth by the edges and shake the wicked out of it the earth takes shape like clay under a seal its features stand out like those of a garment the wicked are denied their light and their upraised arm is broken have you journeyed to the springs of the sea or walked in the recesses of the deep have the gates of death been shown to you have you seen the gates of the shadow of death have you comprehended the vast expanses of the earth tell me if you know all this what is the way to the abode of light and where does darkness reside can you take them to their places do you know the paths to their dwellings surely you know for you were already born you have lived so many years have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of the hail which i reserve for times of trouble for days of war and battle what is the way to the place where the lightning is dispersed or the place where the east winds are scattered over the earth who cuts a channel for the torrents of rain and a path for the thunderstorm to water a land where no man lives a desert with no one in it to satisfy a desolate wasteland and make it sprout with grass does the rain have a father who fathers the drops of dew from whose womb comes the ice who gives birth to the frost from the heavens when the waters become hard as stone when the surface of the deep is frozen can you bind the beautiful pleiades can you loose the cords of orion can you bring forth the constellations in their seasons or lead out the bear with its cubs do you know the laws of the heavens can you set up gods dominion over the earth can you raise your voice to the clouds and cover yourself with a flood of water do you send the lightning bolts on their way do they report to you here we are who endowed the heart with wisdom or gave understanding to the mind who has the wisdom to count the clouds who can tip over the water jars of the heavens when the dust becomes hard and the clods of earth stick together do you hunt the prey for the lioness and satisfy the hunger of the lions when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in a thicket who provides food for the raven when its young cry out to god and wander about for lack of food do you know when the mountain goats give birth do you watch when the doe bears her fawn do you count the months till they bear do you know the time they give birth they crouch down and bring forth their young their labor pains are ended their young thrive and grow strong in the wilds they leave and do not return who let the wild donkey go free who untied his ropes i gave him the wasteland as his home the salt flats as his habitat he laughs at the commotion in the town he does not hear a drivers shout he ranges the hills for his pasture and searches for any green thing will the wild ox consent to serve you will he stay by your manger at night can you hold him to the furrow with a harness will he till the valleys behind you will you rely on him for his great strength will you leave your heavy work to him can you trust him to bring in your grain and gather it to your threshing floor the wings of the ostrich flap joyfully but they cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork she lays her eggs on the ground and lets them warm in the sand unmindful that a foot may crush them that some wild animal may trample them she treats her young harshly as if they were not hers she cares not that her labor was in vain for god did not endow her with wisdom or give her a share of good sense yet when she spreads her feathers to run she laughs at horse and rider do you give the horse his strength or clothe his neck with a flowing mane do you make him leap like a locust striking terror with his proud snorting he paws fiercely rejoicing in his strength and charges into the fray he laughs at fear afraid of nothing he does not shy away from the sword the quiver rattles against his side along with the flashing spear and lance in frenzied excitement he eats up the ground he cannot stand still when the trumpet sounds at the blast of the trumpet he snorts aha he catches the scent of battle from afar the shout of commanders and the battle cry does the hawk take flight by your wisdom and spread his wings toward the south does the eagle soar at your command and build his nest on high he dwells on a cliff and stays there at night a rocky crag is his stronghold from there he seeks out his food his eyes detect it from afar his young ones feast on blood and where the slain are there is he the lord said to job will the one who contends with the almighty correct him let him who accuses god answer him then job answered the lord i am unworthy how can i reply to you i put my hand over my mouth i spoke once but i have no answer twice but i will say no more then the lord spoke to job out of the storm brace yourself like a man i will question you and you shall answer me would you discredit my justice would you condemn me to justify yourself do you have an arm like gods and can your voice thunder like his then adorn yourself with glory and splendor and clothe yourself in honor and majesty unleash the fury of your wrath look at every proud man and bring him low look at every proud man and humble him crush the wicked where they stand bury them all in the dust together shroud their faces in the grave then i myself will admit to you that your own right hand can save you look at the behemoth which i made along with you and which feeds on grass like an ox what strength he has in his loins what power in the muscles of his belly his tail sways like a cedar the sinews of his thighs are close knit his bones are tubes of bronze his limbs like rods of iron he ranks first among the works of god yet his maker can approach him with his sword the hills bring him their produce and all the wild animals play nearby under the lotus plants he lies hidden among the reeds in the marsh the lotuses conceal him in their shadow the poplars by the stream surround him when the river rages he is not alarmed he is secure though the jordan should surge against his mouth can anyone capture him by the eyes or trap him and pierce his nose can you pull in the leviathan with a fishhook or tie down his tongue with a rope can you put a cord through his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook will he keep begging you for mercy will he speak to you with gentle words will he make an agreement with you for you to take him as your slave for life can you make a pet of him like a bird or put him on a leash for your girls will traders barter for him will they divide him up among the merchants can you fill his hide with harpoons or his head with fishing spears if you lay a hand on him you will remember the struggle and never do it again any hope of subduing him is false the mere sight of him is overpowering no one is fierce enough to rouse him who then is able to stand against me who has a claim against me that i must pay everything under heaven belongs to me i will not fail to speak of his limbs his strength and his graceful form who can strip off his outer coat who would approach him with a bridle who dares open the doors of his mouth ringed about with his fearsome teeth his back has rows of shields tightly sealed together each is so close to the next that no air can pass between they are joined fast to one another they cling together and cannot be parted his snorting throws out flashes of light his eyes are like the rays of dawn firebrands stream from his mouth sparks of fire shoot out smoke pours from his nostrils as from a boiling pot over a fire of reeds his breath sets coals ablaze and flames dart from his mouth strength resides in his neck dismay goes before him the folds of his flesh are tightly joined they are firm and immovable his chest is hard as rock hard as a lower millstone when he rises up the mighty are terrified they retreat before his thrashing the sword that reaches him has no effect nor does the spear or the dart or the javelin iron he treats like straw and bronze like rotten wood arrows do not make him flee slingstones are like chaff to him a club seems to him but a piece of straw he laughs at the rattling of the lance his undersides are jagged potsherds leaving a trail in the mud like a threshing sledge he makes the depths churn like a boiling caldron and stirs up the sea like a pot of ointment behind him he leaves a glistening wake one would think the deep had white hair nothing on earth is his equal a creature without fear he looks down on all that are haughty he is king over all that are proud then job replied to the lord i know that you can do all things no plan of yours can be thwarted you asked who is this that obscures my counsel without knowledge surely i spoke of things i did not understand things too wonderful for me to know you said listen now and i will speak i will question you and you shall answer me my ears had heard of you but now my eyes have seen you therefore i despise myself and repent in dust and ashes after the lord had said these things to job he said to eliphaz the temanite i am angry with you and your two friends because you have not spoken of me what is right as my servant job has so now take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant job and sacrifice a burnt offering for yourselves my servant job will pray for you and i will accept his prayer and not deal with you according to your folly you have not spoken of me what is right as my servant job has so eliphaz the temanite bildad the shuhite and zophar the naamathite did what the lord told them and the lord accepted jobs prayer after job had prayed for his friends the lord made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had before all his brothers and sisters and everyone who had known him before came and ate with him in his house they comforted and consoled him over all the trouble the lord had brought upon him and each one gave him a piece of silver and a gold ring the lord blessed the latter part of jobs life more than the first he had fourteen thousand sheep six thousand camels a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand donkeys and he also had seven sons and three daughters the first daughter he named jemimah the second keziah and the third keren happuch nowhere in all the land were there found women as beautiful as jobs daughters and their father granted them an inheritance along with their brothers after this job lived a hundred and forty years he saw his children and their children to the fourth generation and so he died old and full of years  blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers but his delight is in the law of the lord and on his law he meditates day and night he is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither whatever he does prospers not so the wicked they are like chaff that the wind blows away therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous for the lord watches over the way of the righteous but the way of the wicked will perish why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain the kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the lord and against his anointed one let us break their chains they say and throw off their fetters the one enthroned in heaven laughs the lord scoffs at them then he rebukes them in his anger and terrifies them in his wrath saying i have installed my king on zion my holy hill i will proclaim the decree of the lord he said to me you are my son today i have become your father ask of me and i will make the nations your inheritance the ends of the earth your possession you will rule them with an iron scepter you will dash them to pieces like pottery therefore you kings be wise be warned you rulers of the earth serve the lord with fear and rejoice with trembling kiss the son lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way for his wrath can flare up in a moment blessed are all who take refuge in him o lord how many are my foes how many rise up against me many are saying of me god will not deliver him selah but you are a shield around me o lord you bestow glory on me and lift up my head to the lord i cry aloud and he answers me from his holy hill selah i lie down and sleep i wake again because the lord sustains me i will not fear the tens of thousands drawn up against me on every side arise o lord deliver me o my god strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked from the lord comes deliverance may your blessing be on your people selah answer me when i call to you o my righteous god give me relief from my distress be merciful to me and hear my prayer how long o men will you turn my glory into shame how long will you love delusions and seek false gods selah know that the lord has set apart the godly for himself the lord will hear when i call to him in your anger do not sin when you are on your beds search your hearts and be silent selah offer right sacrifices and trust in the lord many are asking who can show us any good let the light of your face shine upon us o lord you have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound i will lie down and sleep in peace for you alone o lord make me dwell in safety give ear to my words o lord consider my sighing listen to my cry for help my king and my god for to you i pray in the morning o lord you hear my voice in the morning i lay my requests before you and wait in expectation you are not a god who takes pleasure in evil with you the wicked cannot dwell the arrogant cannot stand in your presence you hate all who do wrong you destroy those who tell lies bloodthirsty and deceitful men the lord abhors but i by your great mercy will come into your house in reverence will i bow down toward your holy temple lead me o lord in your righteousness because of my enemies make straight your way before me not a word from their mouth can be trusted their heart is filled with destruction their throat is an open grave with their tongue they speak deceit declare them guilty o god let their intrigues be their downfall banish them for their many sins for they have rebelled against you but let all who take refuge in you be glad let them ever sing for joy spread your protection over them that those who love your name may rejoice in you for surely o lord you bless the righteous you surround them with your favor as with a shield o lord do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath be merciful to me lord for i am faint o lord heal me for my bones are in agony my soul is in anguish how long o lord how long turn o lord and deliver me save me because of your unfailing love no one remembers you when he is dead who praises you from the grave i am worn out from groaning all night long i flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears my eyes grow weak with sorrow they fail because of all my foes away from me all you who do evil for the lord has heard my weeping the lord has heard my cry for mercy the lord accepts my prayer all my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed they will turn back in sudden disgrace o lord my god i take refuge in you save and deliver me from all who pursue me or they will tear me like a lion and rip me to pieces with no one to rescue me o lord my god if i have done this and there is guilt on my hands if i have done evil to him who is at peace with me or without cause have robbed my foe then let my enemy pursue and overtake me let him trample my life to the ground and make me sleep in the dust selah arise o lord in your anger rise up against the rage of my enemies awake my god decree justice let the assembled peoples gather around you rule over them from on high let the lord judge the peoples judge me o lord according to my righteousness according to my integrity o most high o righteous god who searches minds and hearts bring to an end the violence of the wicked and make the righteous secure my shield is god most high who saves the upright in heart god is a righteous judge a god who expresses his wrath every day if he does not relent he will sharpen his sword he will bend and string his bow he has prepared his deadly weapons he makes ready his flaming arrows he who is pregnant with evil and conceives trouble gives birth to disillusionment he who digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit he has made the trouble he causes recoils on himself his violence comes down on his own head i will give thanks to the lord because of his righteousness and will sing praise to the name of the lord most high o lord our lord how majestic is your name in all the earth you have set your glory above the heavens from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise because of your enemies to silence the foe and the avenger when i consider your heavens the work of your fingers the moon and the stars which you have set in place what is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him you made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor you made him ruler over the works

lord trust in him and he will do this he will make your righteousness shine like the dawn the justice of your cause like the noonday sun be still before the lord and wait patiently for him do not fret when men succeed in their ways when they carry out their wicked schemes refrain from anger and turn from wrath do not fret it leads only to evil for evil men will be cut off but those who hope in the lord will inherit the land a little while and the wicked will be no more though you look for them they will not be found but the meek will inherit the land and enjoy great peace the wicked plot against the righteous and gnash their teeth at them but the lord laughs at the wicked for he knows their day is coming the wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy to slay those whose ways are upright but their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken better the little that the righteous have than the wealth of many wicked for the power of the wicked will be broken but the lord upholds the righteous the days of the blameless are known to the lord and their inheritance will endure forever in times of disaster they will not wither in days of famine they will enjoy plenty but the wicked will perish the lords enemies will be like the beauty of the fields they will vanish vanish like smoke the wicked borrow and do not repay but the righteous give generously those the lord blesses will inherit the land but those he curses will be cut off if the lord delights in a mans way he makes his steps firm though he stumble he will not fall for the lord upholds him with his hand i was young and now i am old yet i have never seen the righteous forsaken or their children begging bread they are always generous and lend freely their children will be blessed turn from evil and do good then you will dwell in the land forever for the lord loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones they will be protected forever but the offspring of the wicked will be cut off the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever the mouth of the righteous man utters wisdom and his tongue speaks what is just the law of his god is in his heart his feet do not slip the wicked lie in wait for the righteous seeking their very lives but the lord will not leave them in their power or let them be condemned when brought to trial wait for the lord and keep his way he will exalt you to inherit the land when the wicked are cut off you will see it i have seen a wicked and ruthless man flourishing like a green tree in its native soil but he soon passed away and was no more though i looked for him he could not be found consider the blameless observe the upright there is a future for the man of peace but all sinners will be destroyed the future of the wicked will be cut off the salvation of the righteous comes from the lord he is their stronghold in time of trouble the lord helps them and delivers them he delivers them from the wicked

my heart will give understanding i will turn my ear to a proverb with the harp i will expound my riddle why should i fear when evil days come when wicked deceivers surround me those who trust in their wealth and boast of their great riches no man can redeem the life of another or give to god a ransom for him the ransom for a life is costly no payment is ever enough that he should live on forever and not see decay for all can see that wise men die the foolish and the senseless alike perish and leave their wealth to others their tombs will remain their houses forever their dwellings for endless generations though they had named lands after themselves but man despite his riches does not endure he is like the beasts that perish this is the fate of those who trust in themselves and of their followers who approve their sayings selah like sheep they are destined for the grave and death will feed on them the upright will rule over them in the morning their forms will decay in the grave far from their princely mansions but god will redeem my life from the grave he will surely take me to himself selah do not be overawed when a man grows rich when the splendor of his house increases for he will take nothing with him when he dies his splendor will not descend with him though while he lived he counted himself blessed and men praise you when you prosper he will join the generation of his fathers who will never see the light of life a man who has riches without understanding is like the beasts that perish the mighty one god the lord speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to the place where it sets from zion perfect in beauty god shines forth our god comes and will not be silent a fire devours before him and around him a tempest rages he summons the heavens above and the earth that he may judge his people gather to me my consecrated ones who made a covenant with me by sacrifice and the heavens proclaim his righteousness for god himself is judge selah hear o my people and i will speak o israel and i will testify against you i am god your god i do not rebuke you for your sacrifices or your burnt offerings which are ever before me i have no need of a bull from your stall or of goats from your pens for every animal of the forest is mine and the cattle on a thousand hills i know every bird in the mountains and the creatures of the field are mine if i were hungry i would not tell you for the world is mine and all that is in it do i eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats sacrifice thank offerings to god fulfill your vows to the most high and call upon me in the day of trouble i will deliver you and you will honor me but to the wicked god says what right have you to recite my laws or take my covenant on your lips you hate my instruction and cast my words behind you when you see a thief you join with him you throw in your lot with adulterers you use your mouth for evil and harness your tongue to deceit you speak continually against your brother and slander your own mothers son these things you have done and i kept silent you thought i was altogether like you but i will rebuke you and accuse you to your face consider this you who forget god or i will tear you to pieces with none to rescue he who sacrifices thank offerings honors me and he prepares the way so that i may show him the salvation of god have mercy on me o god

time my mother conceived me surely you desire truth in the inner parts you teach me wisdom in the inmost place cleanse me with hyssop and i will be clean wash me and i will be whiter than snow let me

turn back to you save me from bloodguilt o god the god who saves me and my tongue will sing of your righteousness o lord open my lips and my mouth will declare your praise you do not delight in sacrifice or i would bring it you do not take pleasure in burnt offerings the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart o god you will not despise in your good pleasure make zion prosper build up the walls of jerusalem then there will be righteous sacrifices whole burnt offerings to delight you then bulls will be offered on your altar why do you boast of evil you mighty man why do you boast all day long you who are a disgrace in the eyes of god your tongue plots destruction it is like a sharpened razor you who practice deceit you love evil rather than good falsehood rather than speaking the truth selah you love every harmful word o you deceitful tongue surely god will bring you down to everlasting ruin he will snatch you up and tear you from your tent he will uproot you from the land of the living selah the righteous will see and fear they will laugh at him saying here now is the man who did not make god his stronghold but trusted in his great wealth and grew strong by destroying others but i am like an olive tree flourishing in the house of god i trust in gods unfailing love for ever and ever i will praise you forever for what you have done in your name i will hope for your name is good i will praise you in the presence of your saints the fool says in his heart there is no god they are corrupt and their ways are vile there is no one who does good god looks down from heaven on the sons of men to see if there are any who understand any who seek god everyone has turned away they have together become corrupt there is no one who does good not even one will the evildoers never learn those who devour my people as men eat bread and who do not call on god there they were overwhelmed with dread where there was nothing to dread god scattered the bones of those who attacked you you put them to shame for god despised them oh that salvation for israel would come out of zion when god restores the fortunes of his people let jacob rejoice and israel be glad save me o god by your name vindicate me by your might hear my prayer o god listen to the words of my mouth strangers are attacking me ruthless men seek my life men without regard for god selah surely god is my help the lord is the one who sustains me let evil recoil on those who slander me in your faithfulness destroy them i will sacrifice a freewill offering to you i will praise your name o lord for it is good for he has delivered me from all my troubles and my eyes have looked in triumph on my foes listen to my prayer o god do not ignore my plea hear me and answer me my thoughts trouble me and i am distraught at the voice of the enemy at the stares of the wicked for they bring down suffering upon me and revile me in their anger my heart is in anguish within me the terrors of death assail me fear and trembling have beset me horror has overwhelmed me i said oh that i had the wings of a dove i would fly away and be at rest i would flee far away and stay in the desert selah i would hurry to my place of shelter far from the tempest and storm confuse the wicked o lord confound their speech for i see violence and strife in the city day and night they prowl about on its walls malice and abuse are within it destructive forces are at work in the city threats and lies never leave its streets if an enemy were insulting me i could endure it if a foe were raising himself against me i could hide from him but it is you a man like myself my companion my close friend with whom i once enjoyed sweet fellowship as we walked with the throng at the house of god let death take my enemies by surprise let them go down alive to the grave for evil finds lodging among them but i call to god and the lord saves me evening morning and noon i cry out in distress and he hears my voice he ransoms me unharmed from the battle waged against me even though many oppose me god who is enthroned forever will hear them and afflict them selah men who never change their ways and have no fear of god my companion attacks his friends he violates his covenant his speech is smooth as butter yet war is in his heart his words are more soothing than oil yet they are drawn swords cast your cares on the lord and he will sustain you he will never let the righteous fall but you o god will bring down the wicked into the pit of corruption bloodthirsty and deceitful men will not live out half their days but as for me i trust in you be merciful to me o god for men hotly pursue me all day long they press their attack my slanderers pursue me all day long many are attacking me in their pride when i am afraid i will trust in you in god whose word i praise in god i trust i will not be afraid what can mortal man do to me all day long they twist my words they are always plotting to harm me they conspire they lurk they watch my steps eager to take my life on no account let them escape in your anger o god bring down the nations record my lament list my tears on your scroll are they not in your record then my enemies will turn back when i call for help by this i will know that god is for me in god whose word i praise in the lord whose word i praise in god i trust i will not be afraid what can man do to me i am under vows to you o god i will present my thank offerings to you for you have delivered me from death and my feet from stumbling that i may walk before god in the light of life have mercy on me o god have mercy on me for in you my soul takes refuge i will take refuge in the shadow of your wings until the disaster has passed i cry out to god most high to god who fulfills {his purpose} for me he sends from heaven and saves me rebuking those who hotly pursue me selah god sends his love and his faithfulness i am in the midst of lions i lie among ravenous beasts men whose teeth are spears and arrows whose tongues are sharp swords be exalted o god above the heavens let your glory be over all the earth they spread a net for my feet i was bowed down in distress they dug a pit in my path but they have fallen into it themselves selah my heart is steadfast o god my heart is steadfast i will sing and make music awake my soul awake harp and lyre i will awaken the dawn i will praise you o lord among the nations i will sing of you among the peoples for great is your love reaching to the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies be exalted o god above the heavens let your glory be over all the earth do you rulers indeed speak justly do you judge uprightly among men no in your heart you devise injustice and your hands mete out violence on the earth even from birth the wicked go astray from the womb they are wayward and speak lies their venom is like the venom of a snake like that of a cobra that has stopped its ears that will not heed the tune of the charmer however skillful the enchanter may be break the teeth in their mouths o god tear out o lord the fangs of the lions let them vanish like water that flows away when they draw the bow let their arrows be blunted like a slug melting away as it moves along like a stillborn child may they not see the sun before your pots can feel the heat of the thorns whether they be green or dry the wicked will be swept away the righteous will be glad when they are avenged when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked then men will say surely the righteous still are rewarded surely there is a god who judges the earth deliver me from my enemies o god protect me from those who rise up against me deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men see how they lie in wait for me

god save me o god for the waters have come up to my neck i sink in the miry depths where there is no foothold i have come into the deep waters the floods engulf me i am worn out calling for help my throat is parched my eyes fail looking for my god those who hate me without reason outnumber the hairs of my head many are my enemies without cause those who seek to destroy me i am forced to restore what i did not steal you know my folly o god my guilt is not hidden from you may those who hope in you not be disgraced because of me o lord the lord almighty may those who seek you not be put to shame because of me o god of israel for i endure scorn for your sake and shame covers my face i am a stranger to my brothers an alien to my own mothers sons for zeal for your house consumes me and the insults of those who insult you fall on me when i weep and fast i must endure scorn when i put on sackcloth people make sport of me those who sit at the gate mock me and i am the song of the drunkards but i pray to you o lord in the time of your favor in your great love o god answer me with your sure salvation rescue me from the mire do not let me sink deliver me from those who hate me from the deep waters do not let the floodwaters engulf me or the depths swallow me up or the pit close its mouth over me answer me o lord out of the goodness of your love in your great mercy turn to me do not hide your face from your servant answer me quickly for i am in trouble come near and rescue me redeem me because of my foes you know how i am scorned disgraced and shamed all my enemies are before you scorn has broken my heart and has left me helpless i looked for sympathy but there was none for comforters but i found none they put gall in my food and gave me vinegar for my thirst may the table set before them become a snare may it become retribution and a trap may their eyes be darkened so they cannot see and their backs be bent forever pour out your wrath on them let your fierce anger overtake them may their place be deserted let there be no one to dwell in their tents for they persecute those you wound and talk about the pain of those you hurt charge them with crime upon crime do not let them share in your salvation may they be blotted out of the book of life and not be listed with the righteous i am in pain and distress may your salvation o god protect me i will praise gods name in song and glorify him with thanksgiving this will please the lord more than an ox more than a bull with its horns and hoofs the poor will see and be glad you who seek god may your hearts live the lord hears the needy and does not despise his captive people let heaven and earth praise him the seas and all that move in them for god will save zion and rebuild the cities of judah then people will settle there and possess it the children of his servants will inherit it and those who love his name will dwell there hasten o god to save me o lord come quickly to help me may those who seek my life

relied on you you brought me forth from my mothers womb i will ever praise you i have become like a portent to many but you are my strong refuge my mouth is filled with your praise declaring your splendor all day long do not cast me away when i am old do not forsake me when my strength is gone for my enemies speak against me those who wait to kill me conspire together they say god has forsaken him pursue him and seize him for no one will rescue him be not far from me o god come quickly o my god to help me may my accusers perish in shame may those who want to harm me be covered with scorn and disgrace but as for me i will always have hope i will praise you more and more my mouth will tell of your righteousness of your salvation all day long though i know not its measure i will come and proclaim your mighty acts o sovereign lord i will proclaim your righteousness yours alone since my youth o god you have taught me and to this day i declare your marvelous deeds even when i am old and gray do not forsake me o god till i declare your power to the next generation your might to all who are to come your righteousness reaches to the skies o god you who have done great things who o god is like you though you have made me see troubles many and bitter you will restore my life again from the depths of the earth you will again bring me up you will increase my honor and comfort me once again i will praise you with the harp for your faithfulness o my god i will sing praise to you with the lyre o holy one of israel my lips will shout for joy when i sing praise to you i whom you have redeemed my tongue will tell of your righteous acts all day long for those who wanted to harm me have been put to shame and confusion endow the king with your justice o god the royal son with your righteousness he will judge your people in righteousness your afflicted ones with justice the mountains will bring prosperity to the people the hills the fruit of righteousness he will defend the afflicted among the people and save the children of the needy he will crush the oppressor he will endure as long as the sun as long as the moon through all generations he will be like rain falling on a mown field like showers watering the earth in his days the righteous will flourish prosperity will abound till the moon is no more he will rule from sea to sea and from the river to the ends of the earth the desert tribes will bow before him and his enemies will lick the dust the kings of tarshish and of distant shores will bring tribute to him the kings of sheba and seba will present him gifts all kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him for he will deliver the needy who cry out the afflicted who have no one to help he will take pity on the weak and the needy and save the needy from death he will rescue them from oppression and violence for precious is their blood in his sight long may he live may gold from sheba be given him may people ever pray for him and bless him all day long let grain abound throughout the land on the tops of the hills may it sway let its fruit flourish like lebanon let it thrive like the grass of the field may his name endure forever may it continue as long as the sun all nations will be blessed through him and they will call him blessed praise be to the lord god the god of israel who alone does marvelous deeds praise be to his glorious name forever may the whole earth be filled with his glory amen and amen this concludes the prayers of david son of jesse a psalm of asaph surely god is good to israel to those who are pure in heart but as for me my feet had almost slipped i had nearly lost my foothold for i envied the arrogant when i saw the prosperity of the wicked they have no struggles their bodies are healthy and strong they are free from the burdens common to man they are not plagued by human ills therefore pride is their necklace they clothe themselves with violence from their callous hearts comes iniquity the evil conceits of their minds know no limits they scoff and speak with malice in their arrogance they threaten oppression their mouths lay claim to heaven and their tongues take possession of the earth therefore their people turn to them and drink up waters in abundance they say how can god know does the most high have knowledge this is what the wicked are like always carefree they increase in wealth surely in vain have i kept my heart pure in vain have i washed my hands in innocence all day long i have been plagued i have been punished every morning if i had said i will speak thus i would have betrayed your children when i tried to understand all this it was oppressive to me till i entered the sanctuary of god then i understood their final destiny surely you place them on slippery ground you cast them down to ruin how suddenly are they destroyed completely swept away by terrors as a dream when one awakes so when you arise o lord you will despise them as fantasies when my heart was grieved and my spirit embittered i was senseless and ignorant i was a brute beast before you yet i am always with you you hold me by my right hand you guide me with your counsel and afterward you will take me into glory whom have i in heaven but you and earth has nothing i desire besides you my flesh and my heart may fail but god is the strength of my heart and my portion forever those who are far from you will perish you destroy all who are unfaithful to you but as for me it is good to be near god i have made the sovereign lord my refuge i will tell of all your deeds why have you rejected us forever o god why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture remember the people you purchased of old the tribe of your inheritance whom you redeemed mount zion where you dwelt turn your steps toward these everlasting ruins all this destruction the enemy has brought on the sanctuary your foes roared in the place where you met with us they set up their standards as signs they behaved like men wielding axes to cut through a thicket of trees they smashed all the carved paneling with their axes and hatchets they burned your sanctuary to the ground they defiled the dwelling place of your name they said in their hearts we will crush them completely they burned every place where god was worshiped in the land we are given no miraculous signs no prophets are left and none of us knows how long this will be how long will the enemy mock you o god will the foe revile your name forever why do you hold back your hand your right hand take it from the folds of your garment and destroy them but you o god are my king from of old you bring salvation upon the earth it was you who split open the sea by your power you broke the heads of the monster in the waters it was you who crushed the heads of leviathan and gave him as food to the creatures of the desert it was you who opened up springs and streams you dried up the ever flowing rivers the day is yours and yours also the night you established the sun and moon it was you who set all the boundaries of the earth you made both summer and winter remember how the enemy has mocked you o lord how foolish people have reviled your name do not hand over the life of your dove to wild beasts do not forget the lives of your afflicted people forever have regard for your covenant because haunts of violence fill the dark places of the land do not let the oppressed retreat in disgrace may the poor and needy praise your name rise up o god and defend your cause remember how fools mock you all day long do not ignore the clamor of your adversaries the uproar of your enemies which rises continually we give thanks to you o god we give thanks for your name is near men tell of your wonderful deeds you say i choose the appointed time it is i who judge uprightly when the earth and all its people quake it is i who hold its pillars firm selah to the arrogant i say boast no more and to the wicked do not lift up your horns do not lift your horns against heaven do not speak with outstretched neck no one from the east or the west or from the desert can exalt a man but it is god who judges he brings one down he exalts another in the hand of the lord is a cup full of foaming wine mixed with spices he pours it out and all the wicked of the earth drink it down to its very dregs as for me i will declare this forever i will sing praise to the god of jacob i will cut off the horns of all the wicked but the horns of the righteous will be lifted up in judah god is known his name is great in israel his tent is in salem his dwelling place in zion there he broke the flashing arrows the shields and the swords the weapons of war selah you are resplendent with light more majestic than mountains rich with game valiant men lie plundered they sleep their last sleep not one of the warriors can lift his hands at your rebuke o god of jacob both horse and chariot lie still you alone are to be feared who can stand before you when you are angry from heaven you pronounced judgment and the land feared and was quiet when you o god rose up to judge to save all the afflicted of the land selah surely your wrath against men brings you praise and the survivors of your wrath are restrained make vows to the lord your god and fulfill them let all the neighboring lands bring gifts to the one to be feared he breaks the spirit of rulers he is feared by the kings of the earth i cried out to god for help i cried out to god to hear me when i was in distress i sought the lord at night i stretched out untiring hands and my soul refused to be comforted i remembered you o god and i groaned i mused and my spirit grew faint selah you kept my eyes from closing i was too troubled to speak i thought about the former days the years of long ago i remembered my songs in the night my heart mused and my spirit inquired will the lord reject forever will he never show his favor again has his unfailing love vanished forever has his promise failed for all time has god forgotten to be merciful has he in anger withheld his compassion selah then i thought to this i will appeal the years of the right hand of the most high i will remember the deeds of the lord yes i will remember your miracles of long ago i will meditate on all your works and consider all your mighty deeds your ways o god are holy what god is so great as our god you are the god who performs miracles you display your power among the peoples with your mighty arm you redeemed your people the descendants of jacob and joseph selah the waters saw you o god the waters saw you and writhed the very depths were convulsed the clouds poured down water the skies resounded with thunder your arrows flashed back and forth your thunder was heard in the whirlwind your lightning lit up the world the earth trembled and quaked your path led through the sea your way through the mighty waters though your footprints were not seen you led your people like a flock by the hand of moses and aaron o my people hear my teaching listen to the words of my mouth i will open my mouth in parables i will utter hidden things things from of old what we have heard and known what our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children we will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the lord his power and the wonders he has done he decreed statutes for jacob and established the law in israel which he commanded our forefathers to teach their children so the next generation would know them even the children yet to be born and they in turn would tell their children then they would put their trust in god and would not forget his deeds but would keep his commands they would not be like their forefathers a stubborn and rebellious generation whose hearts were not loyal to god whose spirits were not faithful to him the men of ephraim though armed with bows turned back on the day of battle they did not keep gods covenant and refused to live by his law they forgot what he had done the wonders he had shown them he did miracles in the sight of their fathers in the land of egypt in the region of zoan he divided the sea and led them through he made the water stand firm like a wall he guided them with the cloud by day and with light from the fire all night he split the rocks in the desert and gave them water as abundant as the seas he brought streams out of a rocky crag and made water flow down like rivers but they continued to sin against him rebelling in the desert against the most high they willfully put god to the test by demanding the food they craved they spoke against god saying can god spread a table in the desert when he struck the rock water gushed out and streams flowed abundantly but can he also give us food can he supply meat for his people when the lord heard them he was very angry his fire broke out against jacob and his wrath rose against israel for they did not believe in god or trust in his deliverance yet he gave a command to the skies above and opened the doors of the heavens he rained down manna for the people to eat he gave them the grain of heaven men ate the bread of angels he sent them all the food they could eat he let loose the east wind from the heavens and led forth the south wind by his power he rained meat down on them like dust flying birds like sand on the seashore he made them come down inside their camp all around their tents they ate till they had more than enough for he had given them what they craved but before they turned from the food they craved even while it was still in their mouths gods anger rose against them he put to death the sturdiest among them cutting down the young men of israel in spite of all this they kept on sinning in spite of his wonders they did not believe so he ended their days in futility and their years in terror whenever god slew them they would seek him they eagerly turned to him again they remembered that god was their rock that god most high was their redeemer but then they would flatter him with their mouths lying to him with their tongues their hearts were not loyal to him they were not faithful to his covenant yet he was merciful he forgave their iniquities and did not destroy them time after time he restrained his anger and did not stir up his full wrath he remembered that they were but flesh a passing breeze that does not return how often they rebelled against him in the desert and grieved him in the wasteland again and again they put god to the test they vexed the holy one of israel they did not remember his power the day he redeemed them from the oppressor the day he displayed his miraculous signs in egypt his wonders in the region of zoan he turned their rivers to blood they could not drink from their streams he sent swarms of flies that devoured them and frogs that devastated them he gave their crops to the grasshopper their produce to the locust he destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore figs with sleet he gave over their cattle to the hail their livestock to bolts of lightning he unleashed against them his hot anger his wrath indignation and hostility a band of destroying angels he prepared a path for his anger he did not spare them from death but gave them over to the plague he struck down all the firstborn of egypt the firstfruits of manhood in the tents of ham but he brought his people out like a flock he led them like sheep through the desert he guided them safely so they were unafraid but the sea engulfed their enemies thus he brought them to the border of his holy land to the hill country his right hand had taken he drove out nations before them and allotted their lands to them as an inheritance he settled the tribes of israel in their homes but they put god to the test and rebelled against the most high they did not keep his statutes like their fathers they were disloyal and faithless as unreliable as a faulty bow they angered him with their high places they aroused his jealousy with their idols when god heard them he was very angry he rejected israel completely he abandoned the tabernacle of shiloh the tent he had set up among men he sent the ark of his might into captivity his splendor into the hands of the enemy he gave his people over to the sword he was very angry with his inheritance fire consumed their young men and their maidens had no wedding songs their priests were put to the sword and their widows could not weep then the lord awoke as from sleep as a man wakes from the stupor of wine he beat back his enemies he put them to everlasting shame then he rejected the tents of joseph he did not choose the tribe of ephraim but he chose the tribe of judah mount zion which he loved he built his sanctuary like the heights like the earth that he established forever he chose david his servant and took him from the sheep pens from tending the sheep he brought him to be the shepherd of his people jacob of israel his inheritance and david shepherded them with integrity of heart with skillful hands he led them o god the nations have invaded your inheritance they have defiled your holy temple they have reduced jerusalem to rubble they have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds of the air the flesh of your saints to the beasts of the earth they have poured out blood like water all around jerusalem and there is no one to bury the dead we are objects of reproach to our neighbors of scorn and derision to those around us how long o lord will you be angry forever how long will your jealousy burn like fire pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you on the kingdoms that do not call on your name for they have devoured jacob and destroyed his homeland do not hold against us the sins of the fathers may your mercy come quickly to meet us for we are in desperate need help us o god our savior for the glory of your name deliver us and forgive our sins for your names sake why should the nations say where is their god before our eyes make known among the nations that you avenge the outpoured blood of your servants may the groans of the prisoners come before you by the strength of your arm preserve those condemned to die pay back into the laps of our neighbors seven times the reproach they have hurled at you o lord then we your people the sheep of your pasture will praise you forever from generation to generation we will recount your praise hear us o shepherd of israel you who lead joseph like a flock you who sit enthroned between the cherubim shine forth before ephraim benjamin and manasseh awaken your might come and save us restore us o god make your face shine upon us that we may be saved o lord god almighty how long will your anger smolder against the prayers of your people you have fed them with the bread of tears you have made them drink tears by the bowlful you have made us a source of contention to our neighbors and our enemies mock us restore us o god almighty make your face shine upon us that we may be saved you brought a vine out of egypt you drove out the nations and planted it you cleared the ground for it and it took root and filled the land the mountains were covered with its shade the mighty cedars with its branches it sent out its boughs to the sea its shoots as far as the river why have you broken down its walls so that all who pass by pick its grapes boars from the forest ravage it and the creatures of the field feed on it return to us o god almighty look down from heaven and see watch over this vine the root your right hand has planted the son you have raised up for yourself your vine is cut down it is burned with fire at your rebuke your people perish let your hand rest on the man at your right hand the son of man you have raised up for yourself then we will not turn away from you revive us and we will call on your name restore us o lord god almighty make your face shine upon us that we may be saved sing for joy to god our strength shout aloud to the god of jacob begin the music strike the tambourine play the melodious harp and lyre sound the rams horn at the new moon and when the moon is full on the day of our feast this is a decree for israel an ordinance of the god of jacob he established it as a statute for joseph when he went out against egypt where we heard a language we did not understand he says i removed the burden from their shoulders their hands were set free from the basket in your distress you called and i rescued you i answered you out of a thundercloud i tested you at the waters of meribah selah hear o my people and i will warn you if you would but listen to me o israel you shall have no foreign god among you you shall not bow down to an alien god i am the lord your god who brought you up out of egypt open wide your mouth and i will fill it but my people would not listen to me israel would not submit to me so i gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own devices if my people would but listen to me if israel would follow my ways how quickly would i subdue their enemies and turn my hand against their foes those who hate the lord would cringe before him and their punishment would last forever but you would be fed with the finest of wheat with honey from the rock i would satisfy you god presides in the great assembly he gives judgment among the gods how long will you defend the unjust and show partiality to the wicked selah defend the cause of the weak and fatherless maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed rescue the weak and needy deliver them from the hand of the wicked they know nothing they understand nothing they walk about in darkness all the foundations of the earth are shaken i said you are gods you are all sons of the most high

how your enemies are astir how your foes rear their heads with cunning they conspire against your people they plot against those you cherish come they say let us destroy them as a nation that the name of israel be remembered no more with one mind they plot together they form an alliance against you the tents of edom and the ishmaelites of moab and the hagrites gebal ammon and amalek philistia with the people of tyre even assyria has joined them to lend strength to the descendants of lot selah do to them as you did to midian as you did to sisera and jabin at the river kishon who perished at endor and became like refuse on the ground make their nobles like oreb and zeeb all their princes like zebah and zalmunna who said let us take possession of the pasturelands of god make them like tumbleweed o my god like chaff before the wind as fire consumes the forest or a flame sets the mountains ablaze so pursue them with your tempest and terrify them with your storm cover their faces with shame so that men will seek your name o lord may they ever be ashamed and dismayed may they perish in disgrace let them know that you whose name is the lord that you alone are the most high over all

him as far as the east is from the west so far has he removed our transgressions from us as a father has compassion on his children so the lord has compassion on those who fear him for he knows how we are formed he remembers that we are dust as for man his days are like grass he flourishes like a flower of the field the wind blows over it and it is gone and its place remembers it no more but from everlasting to everlasting the lords love is with those who fear him and his righteousness with their childrens children with those who keep his covenant and remember to obey his precepts the lord has

servants who do his will praise the lord all his works everywhere in his dominion praise the lord o my soul praise the lord o my soul o lord my god you are very great you are clothed with splendor and majesty he wraps himself in light as with a garment he stretches out the heavens like a tent and lays the beams of his upper chambers on their waters he makes the clouds his chariot and rides on the wings of the wind he makes winds his messengers flames of fire his servants he set the earth on its foundations it can never be moved you covered it with the deep as with a garment the waters stood above the mountains but at your rebuke the waters fled at the sound of your thunder they took to flight they flowed over the mountains they went down into the valleys to the place you assigned for them you set a boundary they cannot cross never again will they cover the earth he makes springs pour water into the ravines it flows between the mountains they give water to all the beasts of the field the wild donkeys quench their thirst the birds of the air nest by the waters they sing among the branches he waters the mountains from his upper chambers the earth is satisfied by the fruit of his work he makes grass grow for the cattle and plants for man to cultivate bringing forth food from the earth wine that gladdens the heart of man oil to make his face shine and bread that sustains his heart the trees of the lord are well watered the cedars of lebanon that he planted there the birds make their nests the stork has its home in the pine trees the high mountains belong to the wild goats the crags are a refuge for the coneys the moon marks off the seasons and the sun knows when to go down you bring darkness it becomes night and all the beasts of the forest prowl the lions roar for their prey and seek their food from god the sun rises and they steal away they return and lie down in their dens then man goes out to his work to his labor until evening how many are your works o lord in wisdom you made them all the earth is full of your creatures there is the sea vast and spacious teeming with creatures beyond number living things both large and small there the ships go to and fro and the leviathan which you formed to frolic there these all look to you to give them their food at the proper time when you give it to them they gather it up when you open your hand they are satisfied with good things when you hide your face they are terrified when you take away their breath they die and return to the dust when you send your spirit they are created and you renew the face of the earth may the glory of the lord endure forever may the lord rejoice in his works he who looks at the earth and it trembles who touches the mountains and they smoke i will sing to the lord all my life i will sing praise to my god as long as i live may my meditation be pleasing to him as i rejoice in the lord but may sinners vanish from the earth and the wicked be no more praise the lord o my soul praise the lord give thanks to the lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done sing to him sing praise to him tell of all his wonderful acts glory in his holy name let the hearts of those who seek the lord rejoice look to the lord and his strength seek his face always remember the wonders he has done his miracles and the judgments he pronounced o descendants of abraham his servant o sons of jacob his chosen ones he is the lord our god his judgments are in all the earth he remembers his covenant forever the word he commanded for a thousand generations the covenant he made with abraham the oath he swore to isaac he confirmed it to jacob as a decree to israel as an everlasting covenant to you i will give the land of canaan as the portion you will inherit when they were but few in number few indeed and strangers in it they wandered from nation to nation from one kingdom to another he allowed no one to oppress them for their sake he rebuked kings do not touch my anointed ones do my prophets no harm he called down famine on the land and destroyed all their supplies of food and he sent a man before them joseph sold as a slave they bruised his feet with shackles his neck was put in irons till what he foretold came to pass till the word of the lord proved him true the king sent and released him the ruler of peoples set him free he made him master of his household ruler over all he possessed to instruct his princes as he pleased and teach his elders wisdom then israel entered egypt jacob lived as an alien in the land of ham the lord made his people very fruitful he made them too numerous for their foes whose hearts he turned to hate his people to conspire against his servants he sent moses his servant and aaron whom he had chosen they performed his miraculous signs among them his wonders in the land of ham he sent darkness and made the land dark for had they not rebelled against his words he turned their waters into blood causing their fish to die their land teemed with frogs which went up into the bedrooms of their rulers he spoke and there came swarms of flies and gnats throughout their country he turned their rain into hail with lightning throughout their land he struck down their vines and fig trees and shattered the trees of their country he spoke and the locusts came grasshoppers without number they ate up every green thing in their land ate up the produce of their soil then he struck down all the firstborn in their land the firstfruits of all their manhood he brought out israel laden with silver and gold and from among their tribes no one faltered egypt was glad when they left because dread of israel had fallen on them he spread out a cloud as a covering and a fire to give light at night they asked and he brought them quail and satisfied them with the bread of heaven he opened the rock and water gushed out like a river it flowed in the desert for he remembered his holy promise given to his servant abraham he brought out his people with rejoicing his chosen ones with shouts of joy he gave them the lands of the nations and they fell heir to what others had toiled for that they might keep his precepts and observe his laws praise the lord praise the lord give thanks to the lord for he is good his love endures forever who can proclaim the mighty acts of the lord or fully declare his praise blessed are they who maintain justice who constantly do what is right remember me o lord when you show favor to your people come to my aid when you save them that i may enjoy the prosperity of your chosen ones that i may share in the joy of your nation and join your inheritance in giving praise we have sinned even as our fathers did we have done wrong and acted wickedly when our fathers were in egypt they gave no thought to your miracles they did not remember your many kindnesses and they rebelled by the sea the red sea yet he saved them for his names sake to make his mighty power known he rebuked the red sea and it dried up he led them through the depths as through a desert he saved them from the hand of the foe from the hand of the enemy he redeemed them the waters covered their adversaries not one of them survived then they believed his promises and sang his praise but they soon forgot what he had done and did not wait for his counsel in the desert they gave in to their craving in the wasteland they put god to the test so he gave them what they asked for but sent a wasting disease upon them in the camp they grew envious of moses and of aaron who was consecrated to the lord the earth opened up and swallowed dathan it buried the company of abiram fire blazed among their followers a flame consumed the wicked at horeb they made a calf and worshiped an idol cast from metal they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull which eats grass they forgot the god who saved them who had done great things in egypt miracles in the land of ham and awesome deeds by the red sea so he said he would destroy them had not moses his chosen one stood in the breach before him to keep his wrath from destroying them then they despised the pleasant land they did not believe his promise they grumbled in their tents and did not obey the lord so he swore to them with uplifted hand that he would make them fall in the desert make their descendants fall among the nations and scatter them throughout the lands they yoked themselves to the baal of peor and ate sacrifices offered to lifeless gods they provoked the lord to anger by their wicked deeds and a plague broke out among them but phinehas stood up and intervened and the plague was checked this was credited to him as righteousness for endless generations to come by the waters of meribah they angered the lord and trouble came to moses because of them for they rebelled against the spirit of god and rash words came from moses lips they did not destroy the peoples as the lord had commanded them but they mingled with the nations and adopted their customs they worshiped their idols which became a snare to them they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons they shed innocent blood the blood of their sons and daughters whom they sacrificed to the idols of canaan and the land was desecrated by their blood they defiled themselves by what they did by their deeds they prostituted themselves therefore the lord was angry with his people and abhorred his inheritance he handed them over to the nations and their foes ruled over them their enemies oppressed them and subjected them to their power many times he delivered them but they were bent on rebellion and they wasted away in their sin but he took note of their distress when he heard their cry for their sake he remembered his covenant and out of his great love he relented he caused them to be pitied by all who held them captive save us o lord our god and gather us from the nations that we may give thanks to your holy name and glory in your praise praise be to the lord the god of israel from everlasting to everlasting let all the people say amen praise the lord give thanks to the lord for he is good his love endures forever let the redeemed of the lord say this those he redeemed from the hand of the foe those he gathered from the lands from east and west from north and south some wandered in desert wastelands finding no way to a city where they could settle they were hungry and thirsty and their lives ebbed away then they cried out to the lord in their trouble and he delivered them from their distress he led them by a straight way to a city where they could settle let them give thanks to the lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men for he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things some sat in darkness and the deepest gloom prisoners suffering in iron chains for they had rebelled against the words of god and despised the counsel of the most high so he subjected them to bitter labor they stumbled and there was no one to help then they cried to the lord in their trouble and he saved them from their distress he brought them out of darkness and the deepest gloom and broke away their chains let them give thanks to the lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities they loathed all food and drew near the gates of death then they cried to the lord in their trouble and he saved them from their distress he sent forth his word and healed them he rescued them from the grave let them give thanks to the lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy others went out on the sea in ships they were merchants on the mighty waters they saw the works of the lord his wonderful deeds in the deep for he spoke and stirred up a tempest that lifted high the waves they mounted up to the heavens and went down to the depths in their peril their courage melted away they reeled and staggered like drunken men they were at their wits end then they cried out to the lord in their trouble and he brought them out of their distress he stilled the storm to a whisper the waves of the sea were hushed they were glad when it grew calm and he guided them to their desired haven let them give thanks to the lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for men let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the council of the elders he turned rivers into a desert flowing springs into thirsty ground and fruitful land into a salt waste because of the wickedness of those who lived there he turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs there he brought the hungry to live and they founded a city where they could settle they sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a fruitful harvest he blessed them and their numbers greatly increased and he did not let their herds diminish then their numbers decreased and they were humbled by oppression calamity and sorrow he who pours contempt on nobles made them wander in a trackless waste but he lifted the needy out of their affliction and increased their families like flocks the upright see and rejoice but all the wicked shut their mouths whoever is wise let him heed these things and consider the great love of the lord my heart is steadfast o god i will sing and make music with all my soul awake harp and lyre i will awaken the dawn i will praise you o lord among the nations i will sing of you among the peoples for great is your love higher than the heavens your faithfulness reaches to the skies be exalted o god above the heavens and let your glory be over all the earth save us and help us with your right hand that those you love may be delivered god has spoken from his sanctuary in triumph i will parcel out shechem and measure off the valley of succoth gilead is mine manasseh is mine ephraim is my helmet judah my scepter moab is my washbasin upon edom i toss my sandal over philistia i shout in triumph who will bring me to the fortified city who will lead me to edom is it not you o god you who have rejected us and no longer go out with our armies give us aid against the enemy for the help of man is worthless with god we will gain the victory and he will trample down our enemies o god whom i praise do not remain silent for wicked and deceitful men have opened their mouths against me they have spoken against me with lying tongues with words of hatred they surround me they attack me without cause in return for my friendship they accuse me but i am a man of prayer they repay me evil for good and hatred for my friendship appoint an evil man to oppose him let an accuser stand at his right hand when he is tried let him be found guilty and may his prayers condemn him may his days be few may another take his place of leadership may his children be fatherless and his wife a widow may his children be wandering beggars may they be driven from their ruined homes may a creditor seize all he has may strangers plunder the fruits of his labor may no one extend kindness to him or take pity on his fatherless children may his descendants be cut off their names blotted out from the next generation may the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the lord may the sin of his mother never be blotted out may their sins always remain before the lord that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth for he never thought of doing a kindness but hounded to death the poor and the needy and the brokenhearted he loved to pronounce a curse may it come on him he found no pleasure in blessing may it be far from him he wore cursing as his garment it entered into his body like water into his bones like oil may it be like a cloak wrapped about him like a belt tied forever around him may this be the lords payment to my accusers to those who speak evil of me but you o sovereign lord deal well with me for your names sake out of the goodness of your love deliver me for i am poor and needy and my heart is wounded within me i fade away like an evening shadow i am shaken off like a locust my knees give way from fasting my body is thin and gaunt i am an object of scorn to my accusers when they see me they shake their heads help me o lord my god save me in accordance with your love let them know that it is your hand that you o lord have done it they may curse but you will bless when they attack they will be put to shame but your servant will rejoice my accusers will be clothed with disgrace and wrapped in shame as in a cloak with my mouth i will greatly extol the lord in the great throng i will praise him for he stands at the right hand of the needy one to save his life from those who condemn him the lord says to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet the lord will extend your mighty scepter from zion you will rule in the midst of your enemies your troops will be willing on your day of battle arrayed in holy majesty from the womb of the dawn you will receive the dew of your youth the lord has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek the lord is at your right hand he will crush kings on the day of his wrath he will judge the nations heaping up the dead and crushing the rulers of the whole earth

goes out weeping carrying seed to sow will return with songs of joy carrying sheaves with him unless the lord builds the house its builders labor in vain unless the lord watches over the city the watchmen stand guard in vain in vain you rise early and stay up late toiling for food to eat for he grants sleep to those he loves sons are a heritage from the lord children a reward from him like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in ones youth blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them they will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate blessed are

your childrens children peace be upon israel they have greatly oppressed me from my youth let israel say they have greatly oppressed me from my youth but they have not gained the victory over me plowmen have plowed my back and made their furrows long but the lord is righteous he has cut me free from the cords of the wicked may all who hate zion be turned back in shame may they be like grass on the roof which withers before it can grow with it the reaper cannot fill his hands nor the one who gathers fill his arms may those who pass by not say the blessing of the lord be upon you we bless you in the name of the lord out of the depths i cry to you o lord o lord hear my voice let your ears be attentive to my cry for mercy if you o lord kept a record of sins o lord who could stand but with you there is forgiveness therefore you are feared i wait for the lord my soul waits and in his word i put my hope my soul waits for the lord more than watchmen wait for the morning more than watchmen wait for the morning o israel put your hope in the lord for with the lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption he himself will redeem israel from all their sins my heart is not proud o lord my eyes are not haughty i do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me but i have stilled and quieted my soul like a weaned child with its mother like a weaned child is my soul within me o israel put your hope in the lord both now and forevermore o lord remember david and all the hardships he endured he swore an oath to the lord and made a vow to the mighty one of jacob i will not enter my house or go to my bed i will allow no sleep to my eyes no slumber to my eyelids till i find a place for the lord a dwelling for the mighty one of jacob we heard it in ephrathah we came upon it in the fields of jaar let us go to his dwelling place let us worship at his footstool arise o lord and come to your resting place you and the ark of your might may your priests be clothed with righteousness may your saints sing for joy for the sake of david your servant do not reject your anointed one the lord swore an oath to david a sure oath that he will not revoke one of your own descendants i will place on your throne if your sons keep my covenant and the statutes i teach them then their sons will sit on your throne for ever and ever for the lord has chosen zion he has desired it for his dwelling this is my resting place for ever and ever here i will sit enthroned for i have desired it i will bless her with abundant provisions her poor will i satisfy with food i will clothe her priests with salvation and her saints will ever sing for joy here i will make a horn grow for david and set up a lamp for my anointed one i will clothe his enemies with shame but the crown on his head will be resplendent how good and pleasant it is when brothers live together in unity it is like precious oil poured on the head running down on the beard running down on aarons beard down upon the collar of his robes it is as if the dew of hermon were falling on mount zion for there the lord bestows his blessing even life forevermore praise the lord all you

gateways of the city she makes her speech how long will you simple ones love your simple ways how long will mockers delight in mockery and fools hate knowledge if you had responded to my rebuke i would have poured out my heart to you and made my thoughts known to you but since you rejected me when i called and no one gave heed when i stretched out my hand since you ignored all my advice and would not accept my rebuke i in turn will laugh at your disaster i will mock when calamity overtakes you when calamity overtakes you like a storm when disaster sweeps over you like a whirlwind when distress and trouble overwhelm you then they will call to me but i will not answer they will look for me but will not find me since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the lord since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes for the waywardness of the simple will kill them and the complacency of fools will destroy them but whoever listens to me will live in safety and be at ease without fear of harm my son if you accept my words and store up my commands within you turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding and if you call out for insight and cry aloud for understanding and if you look for it as for silver and search for it as for hidden treasure then you will understand the fear of the lord and find the knowledge of god for the lord gives wisdom and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding he holds victory in store for the upright he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones then you will understand what is right and just and fair every good path for

precious than rubies nothing you desire can compare with her long life is in her right hand in her left hand are riches and honor her ways are pleasant ways and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life to those who embrace her those who lay hold of her will be blessed by wisdom the lord laid the earths foundations by understanding he set the heavens in place by his knowledge the deeps were

back later ill give it tomorrow when you now have it with you do not plot harm against your neighbor who lives trustfully near you do not accuse a man for no reason when he has done you no harm do not envy a violent man or choose any of his ways for the lord detests a perverse man but takes the upright into his confidence the lords curse is on the house of the wicked but he blesses the home of the righteous he mocks proud mockers but gives grace to the humble the wise inherit honor but fools he holds up to shame listen my sons to a fathers instruction pay attention and gain understanding i give

hampered when you run you will not stumble hold on to instruction do not let it go guard it well for it is your life do not set foot on the path of the wicked or walk in the way of evil men avoid it do not travel on it turn from it and go on your way for they cannot sleep till they do evil they are robbed of slumber till they make someone fall they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence the path of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn shining ever brighter till the full light of day but the way of the wicked is like deep darkness they do not know what makes them stumble my son pay attention to what i say listen closely to my words do not let them out of your sight keep them within your heart for they are life to those who find them and health to a mans whole body above all else guard your heart for it is the wellspring of life put away perversity from your mouth keep corrupt talk far from your lips let your eyes look straight ahead fix your gaze directly before you make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm do not swerve to the right or the left keep your foot from evil my son pay attention to my wisdom listen well to my words of insight that you may maintain discretion and your lips may preserve knowledge for the lips of an adulteress drip honey and her speech is smoother than oil but in the end she is bitter as gall sharp as a double edged sword her feet go down to death her steps lead straight to the grave she gives no thought to the way of life her paths are crooked but she knows it not now then my sons listen to me do not turn aside from what i say keep to a path far from her do not go near the door of her house lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another mans house at the end of your life you will groan when your flesh and body are spent you will say how i hated discipline how my heart spurned correction i would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors i have come to the brink of utter ruin in the midst of the whole assembly drink water from your own cistern running water from your own well should your springs overflow in the streets your streams of water in the public squares let them be yours alone never to be shared with strangers may your fountain be blessed and may you rejoice in the wife of your youth a loving doe a graceful deer may her breasts satisfy you always may you ever be captivated by her love why be captivated my son by an adulteress why embrace the bosom of another mans wife for a mans ways are in full view of the lord and he examines all his paths the evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him the cords of his sin hold him fast he will die for lack of discipline led astray by his own great folly my son if you have put up security for your neighbor if you have struck hands in pledge for another if you have been trapped by what you said ensnared by the words of your mouth then do this my son to free yourself since you have fallen into your neighbors hands go and humble yourself press your plea with your neighbor allow no sleep to your eyes no slumber to your eyelids free yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter like a bird from the snare of the fowler go to the ant you sluggard consider its ways and be wise it has no commander no overseer or ruler yet it stores its provisions in summer and gathers its food at harvest how long will you lie there you sluggard when will you get up from your sleep a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man a scoundrel and villain who goes about with a corrupt mouth who winks with his eye signals with his feet and motions with his fingers who plots evil with deceit in his heart he always stirs up dissension therefore disaster will overtake him in an instant he will suddenly be destroyed without remedy there are six things the lord hates seven that are detestable to him haughty eyes a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that devises wicked schemes feet that are quick to rush into evil a false witness who pours out lies and a man who stirs up dissension among brothers my son keep your fathers commands and do not forsake your mothers teaching bind them upon your heart forever fasten them around your neck when you walk they will guide you when you sleep they will watch over you when you awake they will speak to you for these commands are a lamp this teaching is a light and the corrections of discipline are the way to life keeping you from the immoral woman from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes for the prostitute reduces you to a loaf of bread and the adulteress preys upon your very life can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched so is he who sleeps with another mans wife no one who touches her will go unpunished men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving yet if he is caught he must pay sevenfold though it costs him all the wealth of his house but a man who commits adultery lacks judgment whoever does so destroys himself blows and disgrace are his lot and his shame will never be wiped away for jealousy arouses a husbands fury and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge he will not accept any compensation he will refuse the bribe however great it is my son keep my words and store up my commands within you keep my commands and you will live guard my teachings as the apple of your eye bind them on your fingers write them on the tablet of your heart say to wisdom you are my sister and call understanding your kinsman they will keep you from the adulteress from the wayward wife with her seductive words at the window of my house i looked out through the lattice i saw among the simple i noticed among the young men a youth who lacked judgment he was going down the street near her corner walking along in the direction of her house at twilight as the day was fading as the dark of night set in then out came a woman to meet him dressed like a prostitute and with crafty intent she is loud and defiant her feet never stay at home now in the street now in the squares at every corner she lurks she took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said i have fellowship offerings at home today i fulfilled my vows so i came out to meet you i looked for you and have found you i have covered my bed with colored linens from egypt i have perfumed my bed with myrrh aloes and cinnamon come lets drink deep of love till morning lets enjoy ourselves with love my husband is not at home he has gone on a long journey he took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon with persuasive words she led him astray she seduced him with her smooth talk all at once he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver like a bird darting into a snare little knowing it will cost him his life now then my sons listen to me pay attention to what i say do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths many are the victims she has brought down her slain are a mighty throng her house is a highway to the grave leading down to the chambers of death does not wisdom call out does not understanding raise her voice on the heights along the way where the paths meet she takes her stand beside the gates leading into the city at the entrances she cries aloud to you o men i call out i raise my voice to all mankind you who are simple gain prudence you who are foolish gain understanding listen for i have worthy things to say i open my lips to speak what is right my mouth speaks what is true for my lips detest wickedness all the words of my mouth are just none of them is crooked or perverse to the discerning all of them are right they are faultless to those who have knowledge choose my instruction instead of silver knowledge rather than choice gold for wisdom is more precious than rubies and nothing you desire can compare with her i wisdom dwell together with prudence i possess knowledge and discretion to fear the lord is to hate evil i hate pride and arrogance evil behavior and perverse speech counsel and sound judgment are mine i have understanding and power by me kings reign and rulers make laws that are just by me princes govern and all nobles who rule on earth i love those who love me and those who seek me find me with me are riches and honor enduring wealth and prosperity my fruit is better than fine gold what i yield surpasses choice silver i walk in the way of righteousness along the paths of justice bestowing wealth on those who love me and making their treasuries full the lord brought me forth as the first of his works before his deeds of old i was appointed from eternity from the beginning before the world began when there were no oceans i was given birth when there were no springs abounding with water before the mountains were settled in place before the hills i was given birth before he made the earth or its fields or any of the dust of the world i was there when he set the heavens in place when he marked out the horizon on the face of the deep when he established the clouds above and fixed securely the fountains of the deep when he gave the sea its boundary so the waters would not overstep his command and when he marked out the foundations of the earth then i was the craftsman at his side i was filled with delight day after day rejoicing always in his presence rejoicing in his whole world and delighting in mankind now then my sons listen to me blessed are those who keep my ways listen to my instruction and be wise do not ignore it blessed is the man who listens to me watching daily at my doors waiting at my doorway for whoever finds me finds life and receives favor from the lord but whoever fails to find me harms himself all who hate me love death wisdom has built her house she has hewn out its seven pillars she has prepared her meat and mixed her wine she has also set her table she has sent out her maids and she calls from the highest point of the city let all who are simple come in here she says to those who lack judgment come eat my food and drink the wine i have mixed leave your simple ways and you will live walk in the way of understanding whoever corrects a mocker invites insult whoever rebukes a wicked man incurs abuse do not rebuke a mocker or he will hate you rebuke a wise man and he will love you instruct a wise man and he will be wiser still teach a righteous man and he will add to his learning the fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom and knowledge of the holy one is understanding for through me your days will be many and years will be added to your life if you are wise your wisdom will reward you if you are a mocker you alone will suffer the woman folly is loud she is undisciplined and without knowledge she sits at the door of her house on a seat at the highest point of the city calling out to those who pass by who go straight on their way let all who are simple come in here she says to those who lack judgment stolen water is sweet food eaten in secret is delicious but little do they know that the dead are there that her guests are in the depths of the grave the proverbs of solomon a wise son brings joy to his father but a foolish son grief to his mother ill gotten treasures are of no value but righteousness delivers from death the lord does not let the righteous go hungry but he thwarts the craving of the wicked lazy hands make a man poor but diligent hands bring wealth he who gathers crops in summer is a wise son but he who sleeps during harvest is a disgraceful son blessings crown the head of the righteous but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked the memory of the righteous will be a blessing but the name of the wicked will rot the wise in heart accept commands but a chattering fool comes to ruin the man of integrity walks securely but he who takes crooked paths will be found out he who winks maliciously causes grief and a chattering fool comes to ruin the mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life but violence overwhelms the mouth of the wicked hatred stirs up dissension but love covers over all wrongs wisdom is found on the lips of the discerning but a rod is for the back of him who lacks judgment wise men store up knowledge but the mouth of a fool invites ruin the wealth of the rich is their fortified city but poverty is the ruin of the poor the wages of the righteous bring them life but the income of the wicked brings them punishment he who heeds discipline shows the way to life but whoever ignores correction leads others astray he who conceals his hatred has lying lips and whoever spreads slander is a fool when words are many sin is not absent but he who holds his tongue is wise the tongue of the righteous is choice silver but the heart of the wicked is of little value the lips of the righteous nourish many but fools die for lack of judgment the blessing of the lord brings wealth and he adds no trouble to it a fool finds pleasure in evil conduct but a man of understanding delights in wisdom what the wicked dreads will overtake him what the righteous desire will be granted when the storm has swept by the wicked are gone but the righteous stand firm forever as vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes so is a sluggard to those who send him the fear of the lord adds length to life but the years of the wicked are cut short the prospect of the righteous is joy but the hopes of the wicked come to nothing the way of the lord is a refuge for the righteous but it is the ruin of those who do evil the righteous will never be uprooted but the wicked will not remain in the land the mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom but a perverse tongue will be cut out the lips of the righteous know what is fitting but the mouth of the wicked only what is perverse the lord abhors dishonest scales but accurate weights are his delight when pride comes then comes disgrace but with humility comes wisdom the integrity of the upright guides them but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity wealth is worthless in the day of wrath but righteousness delivers from death the righteousness of the blameless makes a straight way for them but the wicked are brought down by their own wickedness the righteousness of the upright delivers them but the unfaithful are trapped by evil desires when a wicked man dies his hope perishes all he expected from his power comes to nothing the righteous man is rescued from trouble and it comes on the wicked instead with his mouth the godless destroys his neighbor but through knowledge the righteous escape when the righteous prosper the city rejoices when the wicked perish there are shouts of joy through the blessing of the upright a city is exalted but by the mouth of the wicked it is destroyed a man who lacks judgment derides his neighbor but a man of understanding holds his tongue a gossip betrays a confidence but a trustworthy man keeps a secret for lack of guidance a nation falls but many advisers make victory sure he who puts up security for another will surely suffer but whoever refuses to strike hands in pledge is safe a kindhearted woman gains respect but ruthless men gain only wealth a kind man benefits himself but a cruel man brings trouble on himself the wicked man earns deceptive wages but he who sows righteousness reaps a sure reward the truly righteous man attains life but he who pursues evil goes to his death the lord detests men of perverse heart but he delights in those whose ways are blameless be sure of this the wicked will not go unpunished but those who are righteous will go free like a gold ring in a pigs snout is a beautiful woman who shows no discretion the desire of the righteous ends only in good but the hope of the wicked only in wrath one man gives freely yet gains even more another withholds unduly but comes to poverty a generous man will prosper he who refreshes others will himself be refreshed people curse the man who hoards grain but blessing crowns him who is willing to sell he who seeks good finds goodwill but evil comes to him who searches for it whoever trusts in his riches will fall but the righteous will thrive like a green leaf he who brings trouble on his family will inherit only wind and the fool will be servant to the wise the fruit of the righteous is a tree of life and he who wins souls is wise if the righteous receive their due on earth how much more the ungodly and the sinner whoever loves discipline loves knowledge but he who hates correction is stupid a good man obtains favor from the lord but the lord condemns a crafty man a man cannot be established through wickedness but the righteous cannot be uprooted a wife of noble character is her husbands crown but a disgraceful wife is like decay in his bones the plans of the righteous are just but the advice of the wicked is deceitful the words of the wicked lie in wait for blood but the speech of the upright rescues them wicked men are overthrown and are no more but the house of the righteous stands firm a man is praised according to his wisdom but men with warped minds are despised better to be a nobody and yet have a servant than pretend to be somebody and have no food a righteous man cares for the needs of his animal but the kindest acts of the wicked are cruel he who works his land will have abundant food but he who chases fantasies lacks judgment the wicked desire the plunder of evil men but the root of the righteous flourishes an evil man is trapped by his sinful talk but a righteous man escapes trouble from the fruit of his lips a man is filled with good things as surely as the work of his hands rewards him the way of a fool seems right to him but a wise man listens to advice a fool shows his annoyance at once but a prudent man overlooks an insult a truthful witness gives honest testimony but a false witness tells lies reckless words pierce like a sword but the tongue of the wise brings healing truthful lips endure forever but a lying tongue lasts only a moment there is deceit in the hearts of those who plot evil but joy for those who promote peace no harm befalls the righteous but the wicked have their fill of trouble the lord detests lying lips but he delights in men who are truthful a prudent man keeps his knowledge to himself but the heart of fools blurts out folly diligent hands will rule but laziness ends in slave labor an anxious heart weighs a man down but a kind word cheers him up a righteous man is cautious in friendship but the way of the wicked leads them astray the lazy man does not roast his game but the diligent man prizes his possessions in the way of righteousness there is life along that path is immortality a wise son heeds his fathers instruction but a mocker does not listen to rebuke from the fruit of his lips a man enjoys good things but the unfaithful have a craving for violence he who guards his lips guards his life but he who speaks rashly will come to ruin the sluggard craves and gets nothing but the desires of the diligent are fully satisfied the righteous hate what is false but the wicked bring shame and disgrace righteousness guards the man of integrity but wickedness overthrows the sinner one man pretends to be rich yet has nothing another pretends to be poor yet has great wealth a mans riches may ransom his life but a poor man hears no threat the light of the righteous shines brightly but the lamp of the wicked is snuffed out pride only breeds quarrels but wisdom is found in those who take advice dishonest money dwindles away but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow hope deferred makes the heart sick but a longing fulfilled is a tree of life he who scorns instruction will pay for it but he who respects a command is rewarded the teaching of the wise is a fountain of life turning a man from the snares of death good understanding wins favor but the way of the unfaithful is hard every prudent man acts out of knowledge but a fool exposes his folly a wicked messenger falls into trouble but a trustworthy envoy brings healing he who ignores discipline comes to poverty and shame but whoever heeds correction is honored a longing fulfilled is sweet to the soul but fools detest turning from evil he who walks with the wise grows wise but a companion of fools suffers harm misfortune pursues the sinner but prosperity is the reward of the righteous a good man leaves an inheritance for his childrens children but a sinners wealth is stored up for the righteous a poor mans field may produce abundant food but injustice sweeps it away he who spares the rod hates his son but he who loves him is careful to discipline him the righteous eat to their hearts content but the stomach of the wicked goes hungry the wise woman builds her house but with her own hands the foolish one tears hers down he whose walk is upright fears the lord but he whose ways are devious despises him a fools talk brings a rod to his back but the lips of the wise protect them where there are no oxen the manger is empty but from the strength of an ox comes an abundant harvest a truthful witness does not deceive but a false witness pours out lies the mocker seeks wisdom and finds none but knowledge comes easily to the discerning stay away from a foolish man for you will not find knowledge on his lips the wisdom of the prudent is to give thought to their ways but the folly of fools is deception fools mock at making amends for sin but goodwill is found among the upright each heart knows its own bitterness and no one else can share its joy the house of the wicked will be destroyed but the tent of the upright will flourish there is a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death even in laughter the heart may ache and joy may end in grief the faithless will be fully repaid for their ways and the good man rewarded for his a simple man believes anything but a prudent man gives thought to his steps a wise man fears the lord and shuns evil but a fool is hotheaded and reckless a quick tempered man does foolish things and a crafty man is hated the simple inherit folly but the prudent are crowned with knowledge evil men will bow down in the presence of the good and the wicked at the gates of the righteous the poor are shunned even by their neighbors but the rich have many friends he who despises his neighbor sins but blessed is he who is kind to the needy do not those who plot evil go astray but those who plan what is good find love and faithfulness all hard work brings a profit but mere talk leads only to poverty the wealth of the wise is their crown but the folly of fools yields folly a truthful witness saves lives but a false witness is deceitful he who fears the lord has a secure fortress and for his children it will be a refuge the fear of the lord is a fountain of life turning a man from the snares of death a large population is a kings glory but without subjects a prince is ruined a patient man has great understanding but a quick tempered man displays folly a heart at peace gives life to the body but envy rots the bones he who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their maker but whoever is kind to the needy honors god when calamity comes the wicked are brought down but even in death the righteous have a refuge wisdom reposes in the heart of the discerning and even among fools she lets herself be known righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people a king delights in a wise servant but a shameful servant incurs his wrath a gentle answer turns away wrath but a harsh word stirs up anger the tongue of the wise commends knowledge but the mouth of the fool gushes folly the eyes of the lord are everywhere keeping watch on the wicked and the good the tongue that brings healing is a tree of life but a deceitful tongue crushes the spirit a fool spurns his fathers discipline but whoever heeds correction shows prudence the house of the righteous contains great treasure but the income of the wicked brings them trouble the lips of the wise spread knowledge not so the hearts of fools the lord detests the sacrifice of the wicked but the prayer of the upright pleases him the lord detests the way of the wicked but he loves those who pursue righteousness stern discipline awaits him who leaves the path he who hates correction will die death and destruction lie open before the lord how much more the hearts of men a mocker resents correction he will not consult the wise a happy heart makes the face cheerful but heartache crushes the spirit the discerning heart seeks knowledge but the mouth of a fool feeds on folly all the days of the oppressed are wretched but the cheerful heart has a continual feast better a little with the fear of the lord than great wealth with turmoil better a meal of vegetables where there is love than a fattened calf with hatred a hot tempered man stirs up dissension but a patient man calms a quarrel the way of the sluggard is blocked with thorns but the path of the upright is a highway a wise son brings joy to his father but a foolish man despises his mother folly delights a man who lacks judgment but a man of understanding keeps a straight course plans fail for lack of counsel but with many advisers they succeed a man finds joy in giving an apt reply and how good is a timely word the path of life leads upward for the wise to keep him from going down to the grave the lord tears down the proud mans house but he keeps the widows boundaries intact the lord detests the thoughts of the wicked but those of the pure are pleasing to him a greedy man brings trouble to his family but he who hates bribes will live the heart of the righteous weighs its answers but the mouth of the wicked gushes evil the lord is far from the wicked but he hears the prayer of the righteous a cheerful look brings joy to the heart and good news gives health to the bones he who listens to a life giving rebuke will be at home among the wise he who ignores discipline despises himself but whoever heeds correction gains understanding the fear of the lord teaches a man wisdom and humility comes before honor to man belong the plans of the heart but from the lord comes the reply of the tongue all a mans ways seem innocent to him but motives are weighed by the lord commit to the lord whatever you do and your plans will succeed the lord works out everything for his own ends even the wicked for a day of disaster the lord detests all the proud of heart be sure of this they will not go unpunished through love and faithfulness sin is atoned for through the fear of the lord a man avoids evil when a mans ways are pleasing to the lord he makes even his enemies live at peace with him better a little with righteousness than much gain with injustice in his heart a man plans his course but the lord determines his steps the lips of a king speak as an oracle and his mouth should not betray justice honest scales and balances are from the lord all the weights in the bag are of his making kings detest wrongdoing for a throne is established through righteousness kings take pleasure in honest lips they value a man who speaks the truth a kings wrath is a messenger of death but a wise man will appease it when a kings face brightens it means life his favor is like a rain cloud in spring how much better to get wisdom than gold to choose understanding rather than silver the highway of the upright avoids evil he who guards his way guards his life pride goes before destruction a haughty spirit before a fall better to be lowly in spirit and among the oppressed than to share plunder with the proud whoever gives heed to instruction prospers and blessed is he who trusts in the lord the wise in heart are called discerning and pleasant words promote instruction understanding is a fountain of life to those who have it but folly brings punishment to fools a wise mans heart guides his mouth and his lips promote instruction pleasant words are a honeycomb sweet to the soul and healing to the bones there is a way that seems right to a man but in the end it leads to death the laborers appetite works for him his hunger drives him on a scoundrel plots evil and his speech is like a scorching fire a perverse man stirs up dissension and a gossip separates close friends a violent man entices his neighbor and leads him down a path that is not good he who winks with his eye is plotting perversity he who purses his lips is bent on evil gray hair is a crown of splendor it is attained by a righteous life better a patient man than a warrior a man who controls his temper than one who takes a city the lot is cast into the lap but its every decision is from the lord better a dry crust with peace and quiet than a house full of feasting with strife a wise servant will rule over a disgraceful son and will share the inheritance as one of the brothers the crucible for silver and the furnace for gold but the lord tests the heart a wicked man listens to evil lips a liar pays attention to a malicious tongue he who mocks the poor shows contempt for their maker whoever gloats over disaster will not go unpunished childrens children are a crown to the aged and parents are the pride of their children arrogant lips are unsuited to a fool how much worse lying lips to a ruler a bribe is a charm to the one who gives it wherever he turns he succeeds he who covers over an offense promotes love but whoever repeats the matter separates close friends a rebuke impresses a man of discernment more than a hundred lashes a fool an evil man is bent only on rebellion a merciless official will be sent against him better to meet a bear robbed of her cubs than a fool in his folly if a man pays back evil for good evil will never leave his house starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out acquitting the guilty and condemning the innocent the lord detests them both of what use is money in the hand of a fool since he has no desire to get wisdom a friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity a man lacking in judgment strikes hands in pledge and puts up security for his neighbor he who loves a quarrel loves sin he who builds a high gate invites destruction a man of perverse heart does not prosper he whose tongue is deceitful falls into trouble to have a fool for a son brings grief there is no joy for the father of a fool a cheerful heart is good medicine but a crushed spirit dries up the bones a wicked man accepts a bribe in secret to pervert the course of justice a discerning man keeps wisdom in view but a fools eyes wander to the ends of the earth a foolish son brings grief to his father and bitterness to the one who bore him it is not good to punish an innocent man or to flog officials for their integrity a man of knowledge uses words with restraint and a man of understanding is even tempered even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent and discerning if he holds his tongue an unfriendly man pursues selfish ends he defies all sound judgment a fool finds no pleasure in understanding but delights in airing his own opinions when wickedness comes so does contempt and with shame comes disgrace the words of a mans mouth are deep waters but the fountain of wisdom is a bubbling brook it is not good to be partial to the wicked or to deprive the innocent of justice a fools lips bring him strife and his mouth invites a beating a fools mouth is his undoing and his lips are a snare to his soul the words of a gossip are like choice morsels they go down to a mans inmost parts one who is slack in his work is brother to one who destroys the name of the lord is a strong tower the righteous run to it and are safe the wealth of the rich is their fortified city they imagine it an unscalable wall before his downfall a mans heart is proud but humility comes before honor he who answers before listening that is his folly and his shame a mans spirit sustains him in sickness but a crushed spirit who can bear the heart of the discerning acquires knowledge the ears of the wise seek it out a gift opens the way for the giver and ushers him into the presence of the great the first to present his case seems right till another comes forward and questions him casting the lot settles disputes and keeps strong opponents apart an offended brother is more unyielding than a fortified city and disputes are like the barred gates of a citadel from the fruit of his mouth a mans stomach is filled with the harvest from his lips he is satisfied the tongue has the power of life and death and those who love it will eat its fruit he who finds a wife finds what is good and receives favor from the lord a poor man pleads for mercy but a rich man answers harshly a man of many companions may come to ruin but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a fool whose lips are perverse it is not good to have zeal without knowledge nor to be hasty and miss the way a mans own folly ruins his life yet his heart rages against the lord wealth brings many friends but a poor mans friend deserts him a false witness will not go unpunished and he who pours out lies will not go free many curry favor with a ruler and everyone is the friend of a man who gives gifts a poor man is shunned by all his relatives how much more do his friends avoid him though he pursues them with pleading they are nowhere to be found he who gets wisdom loves his own soul he who cherishes understanding prospers a false witness will not go unpunished and he who pours out lies will perish it is not fitting for a fool to live in luxury how much worse for a slave to rule over princes a mans wisdom gives him patience it is to his glory to overlook an offense a kings rage is like the roar of a lion but his favor is like dew on the grass a foolish son is his fathers ruin and a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping houses and wealth are inherited from parents but a prudent wife is from the lord laziness brings on deep sleep and the shiftless man goes hungry he who obeys instructions guards his life but he who is contemptuous of his ways will die he who is kind to the poor lends to the lord and he will reward him for what he has done discipline your son for in that there is hope do not be a willing party to his death a hot tempered man must pay the penalty if you rescue him you will have to do it again listen to advice and accept instruction and in the end you will be wise many are the plans in a mans heart but it is the lords purpose that prevails what a man desires is unfailing love better to be poor than a liar the fear of the lord leads to life then one rests content untouched by trouble the sluggard buries his hand in the dish he will not even bring it back to his mouth flog a mocker and the simple will learn prudence rebuke a discerning man and he will gain knowledge he who robs his father and drives out his mother is a son who brings shame and disgrace stop listening to instruction my son and you will stray from the words of knowledge a corrupt witness mocks at justice and the mouth of the wicked gulps down evil penalties are prepared for mockers and beatings for the backs of fools wine is a mocker and beer a brawler whoever is led astray by them is not wise a kings wrath is like the roar of a lion he who angers him forfeits his life it is to a mans honor to avoid strife but every fool is quick to quarrel a sluggard does not plow in season so at harvest time he looks but finds nothing the purposes of a mans heart are deep waters but a man of understanding draws them out many a man claims to have unfailing love but a faithful man who can find the righteous man leads a blameless life blessed are his children after him when a king sits on his throne to judge he winnows out all evil with his eyes who can say i have kept my heart pure i am clean and without sin differing weights and differing measures the lord detests them both even a child is known by his actions by whether his conduct is pure and right ears that hear and eyes that see the lord has made them both do not love sleep or you will grow poor stay awake and you will have food to spare its no good its no good says the buyer then off he goes and boasts about his purchase gold there is and rubies in abundance but lips that speak knowledge are a rare jewel take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger hold it in pledge if he does it for a wayward woman food gained by fraud tastes sweet to a man but he ends up with a mouth full of gravel make plans by seeking advice if you wage war obtain guidance a gossip betrays a confidence so avoid a man who talks too much if a man curses his father or mother his lamp will be snuffed out in pitch darkness an inheritance quickly gained at the beginning will not be blessed at the end do not say ill pay you back for this wrong wait for the lord and he will deliver you the lord detests differing weights and dishonest scales do not please him a mans steps are directed by the lord how then can anyone understand his own way it is a trap for a man to dedicate something rashly and only later to consider his vows a wise king winnows out the wicked he drives the threshing wheel over them the lamp of the lord searches the spirit of a man it searches out his inmost being love and faithfulness keep a king safe through love his throne is made secure the glory of young men is their strength gray hair the splendor of the old blows and wounds cleanse away evil and beatings purge the inmost being the kings heart is in the hand of the lord he directs it like a watercourse wherever he pleases all a mans ways seem right to him but the lord weighs the heart to do what is right and just is more acceptable to the lord than sacrifice haughty eyes and a proud heart the lamp of the wicked are sin the plans of the diligent lead to profit as surely as haste leads to poverty a fortune made by a lying tongue is a fleeting vapor and a deadly snare the violence of the wicked will drag them away for they refuse to do what is right the way of the guilty is devious but the conduct of the innocent is upright better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife the wicked man craves evil his neighbor gets no mercy from him when a mocker is punished the simple gain wisdom when a wise man is instructed he gets knowledge the righteous one takes note of the house of the wicked and brings the wicked to ruin if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor he too will cry out and not be answered a gift given in secret soothes anger and a bribe concealed in the cloak pacifies great wrath when justice is done it brings joy to the righteous but terror to evildoers a man who strays from the path of understanding comes to rest in the company of the dead he who loves pleasure will become poor whoever loves wine and oil will never be rich the wicked become a ransom for the righteous and the unfaithful for the upright better to live in a desert than with a quarrelsome and ill tempered wife in the house of the wise are stores of choice food and oil but a foolish man devours all he has he who pursues righteousness and love finds life prosperity and honor a wise man attacks the city of the mighty and pulls down the stronghold in which they trust he who guards his mouth and his tongue keeps himself from calamity the proud and arrogant man mocker is his name he behaves with overweening pride the sluggards craving will be the death of him because his hands refuse to work all day long he craves for more but the righteous give without sparing the sacrifice of the wicked is detestable how much more so when brought with evil intent a false witness will perish and whoever listens to him will be destroyed forever a wicked man puts up a bold front but an upright man gives thought to his ways there is no wisdom no insight no plan that can succeed against the lord the horse is made ready for the day of battle but victory rests with the lord a good name is more desirable than great riches to be esteemed is better than silver or gold rich and poor have this in common the lord is the maker of them all a prudent man sees danger and takes refuge but the simple keep going and suffer for it humility and the fear of the lord bring wealth and honor and life in the paths of the wicked lie thorns and snares but he who guards his soul stays far from them train a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not turn from it the rich rule over the poor and the borrower is servant to the lender he who sows wickedness reaps trouble and the rod of his fury will be destroyed a generous man will himself be blessed for he shares his food with the poor drive out the mocker and out goes strife quarrels and insults are ended he who loves a pure heart and whose speech is gracious will have the king for his friend the eyes of the lord keep watch over knowledge but he frustrates the words of the unfaithful the sluggard says there is a lion outside or i will be murdered in the streets the mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit he who is under the lords wrath will fall into it folly is bound up in the heart of a child but the rod of discipline will drive it far from him he who oppresses the poor to increase his wealth and he who gives gifts to the rich both come to poverty pay attention and listen to the sayings of the wise apply your heart to what i teach for it is pleasing when you keep them in your heart and have all of them ready on your lips so that your trust may be in the lord i teach you today even you have i not written thirty sayings for you sayings of counsel and knowledge teaching you true and reliable words so that you can give sound answers to him who sent you do not exploit the poor because they are poor and do not crush the needy in court for the lord will take up their case and will plunder those who plunder them do not make friends with a hot tempered man do not associate with one easily angered or you may learn his ways and get yourself ensnared do not be a man who strikes hands in pledge or puts up security for debts if you lack the means to pay your very bed will be snatched from under you do not move an ancient boundary stone set up by your forefathers do you see a man skilled in his work he will serve before kings he will not serve before obscure men when you sit to dine with a ruler note well what is before you and put a knife to your throat if you are given to gluttony do not crave his delicacies for that food is deceptive do not wear yourself out to get rich have the wisdom to show restraint cast but a glance at riches and they are gone for they will surely sprout wings and fly off to the sky like an eagle do not eat the food of a stingy man do not crave his delicacies for he is the kind of man who is always thinking about the cost eat and drink he says to you but his heart is not with you you will vomit up the little you have eaten and will have wasted your compliments do not speak to a fool for he will scorn the wisdom of your words do not move an ancient boundary stone or encroach on the fields of the fatherless for their defender is strong he will take up their case against you apply your heart to instruction and your ears to words of knowledge do not withhold discipline from a child if you punish him with the rod he will not die punish him with the rod and save his soul from death my son if your heart is wise then my heart will be glad my inmost being will rejoice when your lips speak what is right do not let your heart envy sinners but always be zealous for the fear of the lord there is surely a future hope for you and your hope will not be cut off listen my son and be wise and keep your heart on the right path do not join those who drink too much wine or gorge themselves on meat for drunkards and gluttons become poor and drowsiness clothes them in rags listen to your father who gave you life and do not despise your mother when she is old buy the truth and do not sell it get wisdom discipline and understanding the father of a righteous man has great joy he who has a wise son delights in him may your father and mother be glad may she who gave you birth rejoice my son give me your heart and let your eyes keep to my ways for a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well like a bandit she lies in wait and multiplies the unfaithful among men who has woe who has sorrow who has strife who has complaints who has needless bruises who has bloodshot eyes those who linger over wine who go to sample bowls of mixed wine do not gaze at wine when it is red when it sparkles in the cup when it goes down smoothly in the end it bites like a snake and poisons like a viper your eyes will see strange sights and your mind imagine confusing things you will be like one sleeping on the high seas lying on top of the rigging they hit me you will say but im not hurt they beat me but i dont feel it when will i wake up so i can find another drink do not envy wicked men do not desire their company for their hearts plot violence and their lips talk about making trouble by wisdom a house is built and through understanding it is established through knowledge its rooms are filled with rare and beautiful treasures a wise man has great power and a man of knowledge increases strength for waging war you need guidance and for victory many advisers wisdom is too high for a fool in the assembly at the gate he has nothing to say he who plots evil will be known as a schemer the schemes of folly are sin and men detest a mocker if you falter in times of trouble how small is your strength rescue those being led away to death hold back those staggering toward slaughter if you say but we knew nothing about this does not he who weighs the heart perceive it does not he who guards your life know it will he not repay each person according to what he has done eat honey my son for it is good honey from the comb is sweet to your taste know also that wisdom is sweet to your soul if you find it there is a future hope for you and your hope will not be cut off do not lie in wait like an outlaw against a righteous mans house do not raid his dwelling place for though a righteous man falls seven times he rises again but the wicked are brought down by calamity do not gloat when your enemy falls when he stumbles do not let your heart rejoice or the lord will see and disapprove and turn his wrath away from him do not fret because of evil men or be envious of the wicked for the evil man has no future hope and the lamp of the wicked will be snuffed out fear the lord and the king my son and do not join with the rebellious for those two will send sudden destruction upon them and who knows what calamities they can bring further sayings of the wise these also are sayings of the wise to show partiality in judging is not good whoever says to the guilty you are innocent peoples will curse him and nations denounce him but it will go well with those who convict the guilty and rich blessing will come upon them an honest answer is like a kiss on the lips finish your outdoor work and get your fields ready after that build your house do not testify against your neighbor without cause or use your lips to deceive do not say ill do to him as he has done to me ill pay that man back for what he did i went past the field of the sluggard past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment thorns had come up everywhere the ground was covered with weeds and the stone wall was in ruins i applied my heart to what i observed and learned a lesson from what i saw a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to rest and poverty will come on you like a bandit and scarcity like an armed man these are more proverbs of solomon copied by the men of hezekiah king of judah it is the glory of god to conceal a matter to search out a matter is the glory of kings as the heavens are high and the earth is deep so the hearts of kings are unsearchable remove the dross from the silver and out comes material for the silversmith remove the wicked from the kings presence and his throne will be established through righteousness do not exalt yourself in the kings presence and do not claim a place among great men it is better for him to say to you come up here than for him to humiliate you before a nobleman what you have seen with your eyes do not bring hastily to court for what will you do in the end if your neighbor puts you to shame if you argue your case with a neighbor do not betray another mans confidence or he who hears it may shame you and you will never lose your bad reputation a word aptly spoken is like apples of gold in settings of silver like an earring of gold or an ornament of fine gold is a wise mans rebuke to a listening ear like the coolness of snow at harvest time is a trustworthy messenger to those who send him he refreshes the spirit of his masters like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of gifts he does not give through patience a ruler can be persuaded and a gentle tongue can break a bone if you find honey eat just enough too much of it and you will vomit seldom set foot in your neighbors house too much of you and he will hate you like a club or a sword or a sharp arrow is the man who gives false testimony against his neighbor like a bad tooth or a lame foot is reliance on the unfaithful in times of trouble like one who takes away a garment on a cold day or like vinegar poured on soda is one who sings songs to a heavy heart if your enemy is hungry give him food to eat if he is thirsty give him water to drink in doing this you will heap burning coals on his head and the lord will reward you as a north wind brings rain so a sly tongue brings angry looks better to live on a corner of the roof than share a house with a quarrelsome wife like cold water to a weary soul is good news from a distant land like a muddied spring or a polluted well is a righteous man who gives way to the wicked it is not good to eat too much honey nor is it honorable to seek ones own honor like a city whose walls are broken down is a man who lacks self control like snow in summer or rain in harvest honor is not fitting for a fool like a fluttering sparrow or a darting swallow an undeserved curse does not come to rest a whip for the horse a halter for the donkey and a rod for the backs of fools do not answer a fool according to his folly or you will be like him yourself answer a fool according to his folly or he will be wise in his own eyes like cutting off ones feet or drinking violence is the sending of a message by the hand of a fool like a lame mans legs that hang limp is a proverb in the mouth of a fool like tying a stone in a sling is the giving of honor to a fool like a thornbush in a drunkards hand is a proverb in the mouth of a fool like an archer who wounds at random is he who hires a fool or any passer by as a dog returns to its vomit so a fool repeats his folly do you see a man wise in his own eyes there is more hope for a fool than for him the sluggard says there is a lion in the road a fierce lion roaming the streets as a door turns on its hinges so a sluggard turns on his bed the sluggard buries his hand in the dish he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth the sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who answer discreetly like one who seizes a dog by the ears is a passer by who meddles in a quarrel not his own like a madman shooting firebrands or deadly arrows is a man who deceives his neighbor and says i was only joking without wood a fire goes out without gossip a quarrel dies down as charcoal to embers and as wood to fire so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife the words of a gossip are like choice morsels they go down to a mans inmost parts like a coating of glaze over earthenware are fervent lips with an evil heart a malicious man disguises himself with his lips but in his heart he harbors deceit though his speech is charming do not believe him for seven abominations fill his heart his malice may be concealed by deception but his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly if a man digs a pit he will fall into it if a man rolls a stone it will roll back on him a lying tongue hates those it hurts and a flattering mouth works ruin do not boast about tomorrow for you do not know what a day may bring forth let another praise you and not your own mouth someone else and not your own lips stone is heavy and sand a burden but provocation by a fool is heavier than both anger is cruel and fury overwhelming but who can stand before jealousy better is open rebuke than hidden love wounds from a friend can be trusted but an enemy multiplies kisses he who is full loathes honey but to the hungry even what is bitter tastes sweet like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home perfume and incense bring joy to the heart and the pleasantness of ones friend springs from his earnest counsel do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father and do not go to your brothers house when disaster strikes you better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away be wise my son and bring joy to my heart then i can answer anyone who treats me with contempt the prudent see danger and take refuge but the simple keep going and suffer for it take the garment of one who puts up security for a stranger hold it in pledge if he does it for a wayward woman if a man loudly blesses his neighbor early in the morning it will be taken as a curse a quarrelsome wife is like a constant dripping on a rainy day restraining her is like restraining the wind or grasping oil with the hand as iron sharpens iron so one man sharpens another he who tends a fig tree will eat its fruit and he who looks after his master will be honored as water reflects a face so a mans heart reflects the man death and destruction are never satisfied and neither are the eyes of man the crucible for silver and the furnace for gold but man is tested by the praise he receives though you grind a fool in a mortar grinding him like grain with a pestle you will not remove his folly from him be sure you know the condition of your flocks give careful attention to your herds for riches do not endure forever and a crown is not secure for all generations when the hay is removed and new growth appears and the grass from the hills is gathered in the lambs will provide you with clothing and the goats with the price of a field you will have plenty of goats milk to feed you and your family and to nourish your servant girls the wicked man flees though no one pursues but the righteous are as bold as a lion when a country is rebellious it has many rulers but a man of understanding and knowledge maintains order a ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops those who forsake the law praise the wicked but those who keep the law resist them evil men do not understand justice but those who seek the lord understand it fully better a poor man whose walk is blameless than a rich man whose ways are perverse he who keeps the law is a discerning son but a companion of gluttons disgraces his father he who increases his wealth by exorbitant interest amasses it for another who will be kind to the poor if anyone turns a deaf ear to the law even his prayers are detestable he who leads the upright along an evil path will fall into his own trap but the blameless will receive a good inheritance a rich man may be wise in his own eyes but a poor man who has discernment sees through him when the righteous triumph there is great elation but when the wicked rise to power men go into hiding he who conceals his sins does not prosper but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy blessed is the man who always fears the lord but he who hardens his heart falls into trouble like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked man ruling over a helpless people a tyrannical ruler lacks judgment but he who hates ill gotten gain will enjoy a long life a man tormented by the guilt of murder will be a fugitive till death let no one support him he whose walk is blameless is kept safe but he whose ways are perverse will suddenly fall he who works his land will have abundant food but the one who chases fantasies will have his fill of poverty a faithful man will be richly blessed but one eager to get rich will not go unpunished to show partiality is not good yet a man will do wrong for a piece of bread a stingy man is eager to get rich and is unaware that poverty awaits him he who rebukes a man will in the end gain more favor than he who has a flattering tongue he who robs his father or mother and says its not wrong he is partner to him who destroys a greedy man stirs up dissension but he who trusts in the lord will prosper he who trusts in himself is a fool but he who walks in wisdom is kept safe he who gives to the poor will lack nothing but he who closes his eyes to them receives many curses when the wicked rise to power people go into hiding but when the wicked perish the righteous thrive a man who remains stiff necked after many rebukes will suddenly be destroyed without remedy when the righteous thrive the people rejoice when the wicked rule the people groan a man who loves wisdom brings joy to his father but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth by justice a king gives a country stability but one who is greedy for bribes tears it down whoever flatters his neighbor is spreading a net for his feet an evil man is snared by his own sin but a righteous one can sing and be glad the righteous care about justice for the poor but the wicked have no such concern mockers stir up a city but wise men turn away anger if a wise man goes to court with a fool the fool rages and scoffs and there is no peace bloodthirsty men hate a man of integrity and seek to kill the upright a fool gives full vent to his anger but a wise man keeps himself under control if a ruler listens to lies all his officials become wicked the poor man and the oppressor have this in common the lord gives sight to the eyes of both if a king judges the poor with fairness his throne will always be secure the rod of correction imparts wisdom but a child left to himself disgraces his mother when the wicked thrive so does sin but the righteous will see their downfall discipline your son and he will give you peace he will bring delight to your soul where there is no revelation the people cast off restraint but blessed is he who keeps the law a servant cannot be corrected by mere words though he understands he will not respond do you see a man who speaks in haste there is more hope for a fool than for him if a man pampers his servant from youth he will bring grief in the end an angry man stirs up dissension and a hot tempered one commits many sins a mans pride brings him low but a man of lowly spirit gains honor the accomplice of a thief is his own enemy he is put under oath and dare not testify fear of man will prove to be a snare but whoever trusts in the lord is kept safe many seek an audience with a ruler but it is from the lord that man gets justice the righteous detest the dishonest the wicked detest the upright the sayings of agur son of jakeh an oracle this man declared to ithiel to ithiel and to ucal i am the most ignorant of men i do not have a mans understanding i have not learned wisdom nor have i knowledge of the holy one who has gone up to heaven and come down who has gathered up the wind in the hollow of his hands who has wrapped up the waters in his cloak who has established all the ends of the earth what is his name and the name of his son tell me if you know every word of god is flawless he is a shield to those who take refuge in him do not add to his words or he will rebuke you and prove you a liar two things i ask of you o lord do not refuse me before i die keep falsehood and lies far from me give me neither poverty nor riches but give me only my daily bread otherwise i may have too much and disown you and say who is the lord or i may become poor and steal and so dishonor the name of my god do not slander a servant to his master or he will curse you and you will pay for it there are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers those who are pure in their own eyes and yet are not cleansed of their filth those whose eyes are ever so haughty whose glances are so disdainful those whose teeth are swords and whose jaws are set with knives to devour the poor from the earth the needy from among mankind the leech has two daughters give give they cry there are three things that are never satisfied four that never say enough the grave the barren womb land which is never satisfied with water and fire which never says enough the eye that mocks a father that scorns obedience to a mother will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley will be eaten by the vultures there are three things that are too amazing for me four that i do not understand the way of an eagle in the sky the way of a snake on a rock the way of a ship on the high seas and the way of a man with a maiden this is the way of an adulteress she eats and wipes her mouth and says ive done nothing wrong under three things the earth trembles under four it cannot bear up a servant who becomes king a fool who is full of food an unloved woman who is married and a maidservant who displaces her mistress four things on earth are small yet they are extremely wise ants are creatures of little strength yet they store up their food in the summer coneys are creatures of little power yet they make their home in the crags locusts have no king yet they advance together in ranks a lizard can be caught with the hand yet it is found in kings palaces there are three things that are stately in their stride four that move with stately bearing a lion mighty among beasts who retreats before nothing a strutting rooster a he goat and a king with his army around him if you have played the fool and exalted yourself or if you have planned evil clap your hand over your mouth for as churning the milk produces butter and as twisting the nose produces blood so stirring up anger produces strife the sayings of king lemuel an oracle his mother taught him o my son o son of my womb o son of my vows do not spend your strength on women your vigor on those who ruin kings it is not for kings o lemuel not for kings to drink wine not for rulers to crave beer lest they drink and forget what the law decrees and deprive all the oppressed of their rights give beer to those who are perishing wine to those who are in anguish let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves for the rights of all who are destitute speak up and judge fairly defend the rights of the poor and needy epilogue the wife of noble character a wife of noble character who can find she is worth far more than rubies her husband has full confidence in her and lacks nothing of value she brings him good not harm all the days of her life she selects wool and flax and works with eager hands she is like the merchant ships bringing her food from afar she gets up while it is still dark she provides food for her family and portions for her servant girls she considers a field and buys it out of her earnings she plants a vineyard she sets about her work vigorously her arms are strong for her tasks she sees that her trading is profitable and her lamp does not go out at night in her hand she holds the distaff and grasps the spindle with her fingers she opens her arms to the poor and extends her hands to the needy when it snows she has no fear for her household for all of them are clothed in scarlet she makes coverings for her bed she is clothed in fine linen and purple her husband is respected at the city gate where he takes his seat among the elders of the land she makes linen garments and sells them and supplies the merchants with sashes she is clothed with

idleness her children arise and call her blessed her husband also and he praises her many women do noble things but you surpass them all charm is deceptive and beauty is fleeting but a woman who fears the lord is to be praised give her the reward she has earned and let her works bring her praise at the city gate  the words of the teacher son of david king in jerusalem meaningless meaningless says the teacher utterly meaningless everything is meaningless what does man gain from all his labor at which he toils under the sun generations come and generations go but the earth remains forever the sun rises and the sun sets and hurries back to where it rises the wind blows to the south and turns to the north round and round it goes ever returning on its course all streams flow into the sea yet the sea is never full to the place the streams come from there they return again all things are wearisome more than one can say the eye never has enough of seeing nor the ear its fill of hearing what has been will be again what has been done will be done again there is nothing new under the sun is there anything of which one can say look this is something new it was here already long ago it was here before our time there is no remembrance of men of old and even those who are yet to come will not be remembered by those who follow i the teacher was king over israel in jerusalem i devoted myself to study and to explore by wisdom all that is done under heaven what a heavy burden god has laid on men i have seen all the things that are done under the sun all of them are meaningless a chasing after the wind what is twisted cannot be straightened what is lacking cannot be counted i thought to myself look i have grown and increased in wisdom more than anyone who has ruled over jerusalem before me i have experienced much of wisdom and knowledge then i applied myself to the understanding of wisdom and also of madness and folly but i learned that this too is a chasing after the wind for with much wisdom comes much sorrow the more knowledge the more grief i thought in my heart come now i will test you with pleasure to find out what is good but that also proved to be meaningless laughter i said is foolish and what does pleasure accomplish i tried cheering myself with wine and embracing folly my mind still guiding me with wisdom i wanted to see what was worthwhile for men to do under heaven during the few days of their lives i undertook great projects i built houses for myself and planted vineyards i made gardens and parks and planted all kinds of fruit trees in them i made reservoirs to water groves of flourishing trees i bought male and female slaves and had other slaves who were born in my house i also owned more herds and flocks than anyone in jerusalem before me i amassed silver and gold for myself and the treasure of kings and provinces i acquired men and women singers and a harem as well the delights of the heart of man i became greater by far than anyone in jerusalem before me in all this my wisdom stayed with me i denied myself nothing my eyes desired i refused my heart no pleasure my heart took delight in all my work and this was the reward for all my labor yet when i surveyed all that my hands had done and what i had toiled to achieve everything was meaningless a chasing after the wind nothing was gained under the sun then i turned my thoughts to consider wisdom and also madness and folly what more can the kings successor do than what has already been done i saw that wisdom is better than folly just as light is better than darkness the wise man has eyes in his head while the fool walks in the darkness but i came to realize that the same fate overtakes them both then i thought in my heart the fate of the fool will overtake me also what then do i gain by being wise i said in my heart this too is meaningless for the wise man like the fool will not be long remembered in days to come both will be forgotten like the fool the wise man too must die so i hated life because the work that is done under the sun was grievous to me all of it is meaningless a chasing after the wind i hated all the things i had toiled for under the sun because i must leave them to the one who comes after me and who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool yet he will have control over all the work into which i have poured my effort and skill under the sun this too is meaningless so my heart began to despair over all my toilsome labor under the sun for a man may do his work with wisdom knowledge and skill and then he must leave all he owns to someone who has not worked for it this too is meaningless and a great misfortune what does a man get for all the toil and anxious striving with which he labors under the sun all his days his work is pain and grief even at night his mind does not rest this too is meaningless a man can do nothing better than to eat and drink and find satisfaction in his work this too i see is from the hand of god for without him who can eat or find enjoyment to the man who pleases him god gives wisdom knowledge and happiness but to the sinner he gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth to hand it over to the one who pleases god this too is meaningless a chasing after the wind there is a time for everything and a season for every activity under heaven a time to be born and a time to die a time to plant and a time to uproot a time to kill and a time to heal a time to tear down and a time to build a time to weep and a time to laugh a time to mourn and a time to dance a time to scatter stones and a time to gather them a time to embrace and a time to refrain a time to search and a time to give up a time to keep and a time to throw away a time to tear and a time to mend a time to be silent and a time to speak a time to love and a time to hate a time for war and a time for peace what does the worker gain from his toil i have seen the burden god has laid on men he has made everything beautiful in its time he has also set eternity in the hearts of men yet they cannot fathom what god has done from beginning to end i know that there is nothing better for men than to be happy and do good while they live that everyone may eat and drink and find satisfaction in all his toil this is the gift of god i know that everything god does will endure forever nothing can be added to it and nothing taken from it god does it so that men will revere him whatever is has already been and what will be has been before and god will call the past to account and i saw something else under the sun in the place of judgment wickedness was there in the place of justice wickedness was there i thought in my heart god will bring to judgment both the righteous and the wicked for there will be a time for every activity a time for every deed i also thought as for men god tests them so that they may see that they are like the animals mans fate is like that of the animals the same fate awaits them both as one dies so dies the other all have the same breath man has no advantage over the animal everything is meaningless all go to the same place all come from dust and to dust all return who knows if the spirit of man rises upward and if the spirit of the animal goes down into the earth so i saw that there is nothing better for a man than to enjoy his work because that is his lot for who can bring him to see what will happen after him again i looked and saw all the oppression that was taking place under the sun i saw the tears of the oppressed and they have no comforter power was on the side of their oppressors and they have no comforter and i declared that the dead who had already died are happier than the living who are still alive but better than both is he who has not yet been who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun and i saw that all labor and all achievement spring from mans envy of his neighbor this too is meaningless a chasing after the wind the fool folds his hands and ruins himself better one handful with tranquillity than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind again i saw something meaningless under the sun there was a man all alone he had neither son nor brother there was no end to his toil yet his eyes were not content with his wealth for whom am i toiling he asked and why am i depriving myself of enjoyment this too is meaningless a miserable business two are better than one because they have a good return for their work if one falls down his friend can help him up but pity the man who falls and has no one to help him up also if two lie down together they will keep warm but how can one keep warm alone though one may be overpowered two can defend themselves a cord of three strands is not quickly broken better a poor but wise youth than an old but foolish king who no longer knows how to take warning the youth may have come from prison to the kingship or he may have been born in poverty within his kingdom i saw that all who lived and walked under the sun followed the youth the kings successor there was no end to all the people who were before them but those who came later were not pleased with the successor this too is meaningless a chasing after the wind guard your steps when you go to the house of god go near to listen rather than to offer the sacrifice of fools who do not know that they do wrong do not be quick with your mouth do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before god god is in heaven and you are on earth so let your words be few as a dream comes when there are many cares so the speech of a fool when there are many words when you make a vow to god do not delay in fulfilling it he has no pleasure in fools fulfill your vow it is better not to vow than to make a vow and not fulfill it do not let your mouth lead you into sin and do not protest to the temple messenger my vow was a mistake why should god be angry at what you say and destroy the work of your hands much dreaming and many words are meaningless therefore stand in awe of god if you see the poor oppressed in a district and justice and rights denied do not be surprised at such things for one official is eyed by a higher one and over them both are others higher still the increase from the land is taken by all the king himself profits from the fields whoever loves money never has money enough whoever loves wealth is never satisfied with his income this too is meaningless as goods increase so do those who consume them and what benefit are they to the owner except to feast his eyes on them the sleep of a laborer is sweet whether he eats little or much but the abundance of a rich man permits him no sleep i have seen a grievous evil under the sun wealth hoarded to the harm of its owner or wealth lost through some misfortune so that when he has a son there is nothing left for him naked a man comes from his mothers womb and as he comes so he departs he takes nothing from his labor that he can carry in his hand this too is a grievous evil as a man comes so he departs and what does he gain since he toils for the wind all his days he eats in darkness with great frustration affliction and anger then i realized that it is good and proper for a man to eat and drink and to find satisfaction in his toilsome labor under the sun during the few days of life god has given him for this is his lot moreover when god gives any man wealth and possessions and enables him to enjoy them to accept his lot and be happy in his work this is a gift of god he seldom reflects on the days of his life because god keeps him occupied with gladness of heart i have seen another evil under the sun and it weighs heavily on men god gives a man wealth possessions and honor so that he lacks nothing his heart desires but god does not enable him to enjoy them and a stranger enjoys them instead this is meaningless a grievous evil a man may have a hundred children and live many years yet no matter how long he lives if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial i say that a stillborn child is better off than he it comes without meaning it departs in darkness and in darkness its name is shrouded though it never saw the sun or knew anything it has more rest than does that man even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity do not all go to the same place all mans efforts are for his mouth yet his appetite is never satisfied what advantage has a wise man over a fool what does a poor man gain by knowing how to conduct himself before others better what the eye sees than the roving of the appetite this too is meaningless a chasing after the wind whatever exists has already been named and what man is has been known no man can contend with one who is stronger than he the more the words the less the meaning and how does that profit anyone for who knows what is good for a man in life during the few and meaningless days he passes through like a shadow who can tell him what will happen under the sun after he is gone a good name is better than fine perfume and the day of death better than the day of birth it is better to go to a house of mourning than to go to a house of feasting for death is the destiny of every man the living should take this to heart sorrow is better than laughter because a sad face is good for the heart the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning but the heart of fools is in the house of pleasure it is better to heed a wise mans rebuke than to listen to the song of fools like the crackling of thorns under the pot so is the laughter of fools this too is meaningless extortion turns a wise man into a fool and a bribe corrupts the heart the end of a matter is better than its beginning and patience is better than pride do not be quickly provoked in your spirit for anger resides in the lap of fools do not say why were the old days better than these for it is not wise to ask such questions wisdom like an inheritance is a good thing and benefits those who see the sun wisdom is a shelter as money is a shelter but the advantage of knowledge is this that wisdom preserves the life of its possessor consider what god has done who can straighten what he has made crooked when times are good be happy but when times are bad consider god has made the one as well as the other therefore a man cannot discover anything about his future in this meaningless life of mine i have seen both of these a righteous man perishing in his righteousness and a wicked man living long in his wickedness do not be overrighteous neither be overwise why destroy yourself do not be overwicked and do not be a fool why die before your time it is good to grasp the one and not let go of the other the man who fears god will avoid all extremes wisdom makes one wise man more powerful than ten rulers in a city there is not a righteous man on earth who does what is right and never sins do not pay attention to every word people say or you may hear your servant cursing you for you know in your heart that many times you yourself have cursed others all this i tested by wisdom and i said i am determined to be wise but this was beyond me whatever wisdom may be it is far off and most profound who can discover it so i turned my mind to understand to investigate and to search out wisdom and the scheme of things and to understand the stupidity of wickedness and the madness of folly i find more bitter than death the woman who is a snare whose heart is a trap and whose hands are chains the man who pleases god will escape her but the sinner she will ensnare look says the teacher this is what i have discovered adding one thing to another to discover the scheme of things while i was still searching but not finding i found one upright man among a thousand but not one upright woman among them all this only have i found god made mankind upright but men have gone in search of many schemes who is like the wise man who knows the explanation of things wisdom brightens a mans face and changes its hard appearance obey the kings command i say because you took an oath before god do not be in a hurry to leave the kings presence do not stand up for a bad cause for he will do whatever he pleases since a kings word is supreme who can say to him what are you doing whoever obeys his command will come to no harm and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure for there is a proper time and procedure for every matter though a mans misery weighs heavily upon him since no man knows the future who can tell him what is to come no man has power over the wind to contain it so no one has power over the day of his death as no one is discharged in time of war so wickedness will not release those who practice it all this i saw as i applied my mind to everything done under the sun there is a time when a man lords it over others to his own hurt then too i saw the wicked buried those who used to come and go from the holy place and receive praise in the city where they did this this too is meaningless when the sentence for a crime is not quickly carried out the hearts of the people are filled with schemes to do wrong although a wicked man commits a hundred crimes and still lives a long time i know that it will go better with god fearing men who are reverent before god yet because the wicked do not fear god it will not go well with them and their days will not lengthen like a shadow there is something else meaningless that occurs on earth righteous men who get what the wicked deserve and wicked men who get what the righteous deserve this too i say is meaningless so i commend the enjoyment of life because nothing is better for a man under the sun than to eat and drink and be glad then joy will accompany him in his work all the days of the life god has given him under the sun when i applied my mind to know wisdom and to observe mans labor on earth his eyes not seeing sleep day or night then i saw all that god has done no one can comprehend what goes on under the sun despite all his efforts to search it out man cannot discover its meaning even if a wise man claims he knows he cannot really comprehend it so i reflected on all this and concluded that the righteous and the wise and what they do are in gods hands but no man knows whether love or hate awaits him all share a common destiny the righteous and the wicked the good and the bad the clean and the unclean those who offer sacrifices and those who do not as it is with the good man so with the sinner as it is with those who take oaths so with those who are afraid to take them this is the evil in everything that happens under the sun the same destiny overtakes all the hearts of men moreover are full of evil and there is madness in their hearts while they live and afterward they join the dead anyone who is among the living has hope even a live dog is better off than a dead lion for the living know that they will die but the dead know nothing they have no further reward and even the memory of them is forgotten their love their hate and their jealousy have long since vanished never again will they have a part in anything that happens under the sun go eat your food with gladness and drink your wine with a joyful heart for it is now that god favors what you do always be clothed in white and always anoint your head with oil enjoy life with your wife whom you love all the days of this meaningless life that god has given you under the sun all your meaningless days for this is your lot in life and in your toilsome labor under the sun whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your might for in the grave where you are going there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom i have seen something else under the sun the race is not to the swift or the battle to the strong nor does food come to the wise or wealth to the brilliant or favor to the learned but time and chance happen to them all moreover no man knows when his hour will come as fish are caught in a cruel net or birds are taken in a snare so men are trapped by evil times that fall unexpectedly upon them i also saw under the sun this example of wisdom that greatly impressed me there was once a small city with only a few people in it and a powerful king came against it surrounded it and built huge siegeworks against it now there lived in that city a man poor but wise and he saved the city by his wisdom but nobody remembered that poor man so i said wisdom is better than strength but the poor mans wisdom is despised and his words are no longer heeded the quiet words of the wise are more to be heeded than the shouts of a ruler of fools wisdom is better than weapons of war but one sinner destroys much good as dead flies give perfume a bad smell so a little folly outweighs wisdom and honor the heart of the wise inclines to the right but the heart of the fool to the left even as he walks along the road the fool lacks sense and shows everyone how stupid he is if a rulers anger rises against you do not leave your post calmness can lay great errors to rest there is an evil i have seen under the sun the sort of error that arises from a ruler fools are put in many high positions while the rich occupy the low ones i have seen slaves on horseback while princes go on foot like slaves whoever digs a pit may fall into it whoever breaks through a wall may be bitten by a snake whoever quarries stones may be injured by them whoever splits logs may be endangered by them if the ax is dull and its edge unsharpened more strength is needed but skill will bring success if a snake bites before it is charmed there is no profit for the charmer words from a wise mans mouth are gracious but a fool is consumed by his own lips at the beginning his words are folly at the end they are wicked madness and the fool multiplies words no one knows what is coming who can tell him what will happen after him a fools work wearies him he does not know the way to town woe to you o land whose king was a servant and whose princes feast in the morning blessed are you o land whose king is of noble birth and whose princes eat at a proper time for strength and not for drunkenness if a man is lazy the rafters sag if his hands are idle the house leaks a feast is made for laughter and wine makes life merry but money is the answer for everything do not revile the king even in your thoughts or curse the rich in your bedroom because a bird of the air may carry your words and a bird on the wing may report what you say cast your bread upon the waters for after many days you will find it again give portions to seven yes to eight for you do not know what disaster may come upon the land if clouds are full of water they pour rain upon the earth whether a tree falls to the south or to the north in the place where it falls there will it lie whoever watches the wind will not plant whoever looks at the clouds will not reap as you do not know the path of the wind or how the body is formed in a mothers womb so you cannot understand the work of god the maker of all things sow your seed in the morning and at evening let not your hands be idle for you do not know which will succeed whether this or that or whether both will do equally well light is sweet and it pleases the eyes to see the sun however many years a man may live let him enjoy them all but let him remember the days of darkness for they will be many everything to come is meaningless be happy young man while you are young and let your heart give you joy in the days of your youth follow the ways of your heart and whatever your eyes see but know that for all these things god will bring you to judgment so then banish anxiety from your heart and cast off the troubles of your body for youth and vigor are meaningless remember your creator in the days of your youth before the days of trouble come and the years approach when you will say i find no pleasure in them before the sun and the light and the moon and the stars grow dark and the clouds return after the rain when the keepers of the house tremble and the strong men stoop when the grinders cease because they are few and those looking through the windows grow dim when the doors to the street are closed and the sound of grinding fades when men rise up at the sound of birds but all their songs grow faint when men are afraid of heights and of dangers in the streets when the almond tree blossoms and the grasshopper drags himself along and desire no longer is stirred then man goes to his eternal home and mourners go about the streets remember him before the silver cord is severed or the golden bowl is broken before the pitcher is shattered at the spring or the wheel broken at the well and the dust returns to the ground it came from and the spirit returns to god who gave it meaningless meaningless says the teacher everything is meaningless not only was the teacher wise but also he imparted knowledge to the people he pondered and searched out and set in order many proverbs the teacher searched to find just the right words and what he wrote was upright and true the words of the wise are like goads their collected sayings like firmly embedded nails given by one shepherd be warned my son of anything in addition to them of making many books there is no end and much study wearies the body now all has been heard here is the conclusion of the matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man for god will bring every deed into judgment including every hidden thing whether it is good or evil  solomons song of songs let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth for your love is more delightful than wine pleasing is the fragrance of your perfumes your name is like perfume poured out no wonder the maidens love you take me away with you let us hurry let the king bring me into his chambers we rejoice and delight in you we will praise your love more than wine how right they are to adore you dark am i yet lovely o daughters of jerusalem dark like the tents of kedar like the tent curtains of solomon do

blossoms have opened and if the pomegranates are in bloom there i will give you my love the mandrakes send out their fragrance and at our door is every delicacy both new and old that i have stored up for you my lover if only you were to me like a brother who was nursed at my mothers breasts then if i found you outside i would kiss you and no one would despise me i would lead you and bring you to my mothers house she who has taught me i would give you spiced wine to drink the nectar of my pomegranates his left arm is under my head and his right arm embraces me daughters of jerusalem i charge you do not arouse or awaken love until it so desires who is this coming up from the desert leaning on her lover under the apple tree i roused you there your mother conceived you there she who was in labor gave you birth place me like a seal over your heart like a seal on your arm for love is as strong as death its jealousy unyielding as the grave it burns like blazing fire like a mighty flame many waters cannot quench love rivers cannot wash it away if one were to give all the wealth of his house for love it would be utterly scorned we have a young sister and her breasts are not yet grown what shall we do for our sister for the day she is spoken for if she is a wall we will build towers of silver on her if she is a door we will enclose her with panels of cedar i am a wall and my breasts are like towers thus i have become in his eyes like one bringing contentment solomon had a vineyard in baal hamon he let out his vineyard to tenants each was to bring for its fruit a thousand shekels of silver but my own vineyard is mine to give the thousand shekels are for you o solomon and two hundred are for those who tend its fruit you who dwell in the gardens with friends in attendance let me hear your voice come away my lover and be like a gazelle or like a young stag on the spice laden mountains  the vision concerning judah and jerusalem that isaiah son of amoz saw during the reigns of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah hear o heavens listen o earth for the lord has spoken i reared children and brought them up but they have rebelled against me the ox knows his master the donkey his owners manger but israel does not know my people do not understand ah sinful nation a people loaded with guilt a brood of evildoers children given to corruption they have forsaken the lord they have spurned the holy one of israel and turned their backs on him why should you be beaten anymore why do you persist in rebellion your whole head is injured your whole heart afflicted from the sole of your foot to the top of your head there is no soundness only wounds and welts and open sores not cleansed or bandaged or soothed with oil your country is desolate your cities burned with fire your fields are being stripped by foreigners right before you laid waste as when overthrown by strangers the daughter of zion is left like a shelter in a vineyard like a hut in a field of melons like a city under siege unless the lord almighty had left us some survivors we would have become like sodom we would have been like gomorrah hear the word of the lord you rulers of sodom listen to the law of our god you people of gomorrah the multitude of your sacrifices what are they to me says the lord i have more than enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fattened animals i have no pleasure in the blood of bulls and lambs and goats when you come to appear before me who has asked this of you this trampling of my courts stop bringing meaningless offerings your incense is detestable to me new moons sabbaths and convocations i cannot bear your evil assemblies your new moon festivals and your appointed feasts my soul hates they have become a burden to me i am weary of bearing them when you spread out your hands in prayer i will hide my eyes from you even if you offer many prayers i will not listen your hands are full of blood wash and make yourselves clean take your evil deeds out of my sight stop doing wrong learn to do right seek justice encourage the oppressed defend the cause of the fatherless plead the case of the widow come now let us reason together says the lord though your sins are like scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they are red as crimson they shall be like wool if you are willing and obedient you will eat the best from the land but if you resist and rebel you will be devoured by the sword for the mouth of the lord has spoken see how the faithful city has become a harlot she once was full of justice righteousness used to dwell in her but now murderers your silver has become dross your choice wine is diluted with water your rulers are rebels companions of thieves they all love bribes and chase after gifts they do not defend the cause of the fatherless the widows case does not come before them therefore the lord the lord almighty the mighty one of israel declares ah i will get relief from my foes and avenge myself on my enemies i will turn my hand against you i will thoroughly purge away your dross and remove all your impurities i will restore your judges as in days of old your counselors as at the beginning afterward you will be called the city of righteousness the faithful city zion will be redeemed with justice her penitent ones with righteousness but rebels and sinners will both be broken and those who forsake the lord will perish you will be ashamed because of the sacred oaks in which you have delighted you will be disgraced because of the gardens that you have chosen you will be like an oak with fading leaves like a garden without water the mighty man will become tinder and his work a spark both will burn together with no one to quench the fire this is what isaiah son of amoz saw concerning judah and jerusalem in the last days the mountain of the lords temple will be established as chief among the mountains it will be raised above the hills and all nations will stream to it many peoples will come and say come let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob he will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths the law will go out from zion the word of the lord from jerusalem he will judge between the nations and will settle disputes for many peoples they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore come o house of jacob let us walk in the light of the lord you have abandoned your people the house of jacob they are full of superstitions from the east they practice divination like the philistines and clasp hands with pagans their land is full of silver and gold there is no end to their treasures their land is full of horses there is no end to their chariots their land is full of idols they bow down to the work of their hands to what their fingers have made so man will be brought low and mankind humbled do not forgive them go into the rocks hide in the ground from dread of the lord and the splendor of his majesty the eyes of the arrogant man will be humbled and the pride of men brought low the lord alone will be exalted in that day the lord almighty has a day in store for all the proud and lofty for all that is exalted and they will be humbled for all the cedars of lebanon tall and lofty and all the oaks of bashan for all the towering mountains and all the high hills for every lofty tower and every fortified wall for every trading ship and every stately vessel the arrogance of man will be brought low and the pride of men humbled the lord alone will be exalted in that day and the idols will totally disappear men will flee to caves in the rocks and to holes in the ground from dread of the lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth in that day men will throw away to the rodents and bats their idols of silver and idols of gold which they made to worship they will flee to caverns in the rocks and to the overhanging crags from dread of the lord and the splendor of his majesty when he rises to shake the earth stop trusting in man who has but a breath in his nostrils of what account is he see now the lord the lord almighty is about to take from jerusalem and judah both supply and support all supplies of food and all supplies of water the hero and warrior the judge and prophet the soothsayer and elder the captain of fifty and man of rank the counselor skilled craftsman and clever enchanter i will make boys their officials mere children will govern them people will oppress each other man against man neighbor against neighbor the young will rise up against the old the base against the honorable a man will seize one of his brothers at his fathers home and say you have a cloak you be our leader take charge of this heap of ruins but in that day he will cry out i have no remedy i have no food or clothing in my house do not make me the leader of the people jerusalem staggers judah is falling their words and deeds are against the lord defying his glorious presence the look on their faces testifies against them they parade their sin like sodom they do not hide it woe to them they have brought disaster upon themselves tell the righteous it will be well with them for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds woe to the wicked disaster is upon them they will be paid back for what their hands have done youths oppress my people women rule over them o my people your guides lead you astray they turn you from the path the lord takes his place in court he rises to judge the people the lord enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people it is you who have ruined my vineyard the plunder from the poor is in your houses what do you mean by crushing my people and grinding the faces of the poor declares the lord the lord almighty the lord says the women of zion are haughty walking along with outstretched necks flirting with their eyes tripping along with mincing steps with ornaments jingling on their ankles therefore the lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of zion the lord will make their scalps bald in that day the lord will snatch away their finery the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces the earrings and bracelets and veils the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes the perfume bottles and charms the signet rings and nose rings the fine robes and the capes and cloaks the purses and mirrors and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls instead of fragrance there will be a stench instead of a sash a rope instead of well dressed hair baldness instead of fine clothing sackcloth instead of beauty branding your men will fall by the sword your warriors in battle the gates of zion will lament and mourn destitute she will sit on the ground in that day seven women will take hold of one man and say we will eat our own food and provide our own clothes only let us be called by your name take away our disgrace in that day the branch of the lord will be beautiful and glorious and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors in israel those who are left in zion who remain in jerusalem will be called holy all who are recorded among the living in jerusalem the lord will wash away the filth of the women of zion he will cleanse the bloodstains from jerusalem by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of fire then the lord will create over all of mount zion and over those who assemble there a cloud of smoke by day and a glow of flaming fire by night over all the glory will be a canopy it will be a shelter and shade from the heat of the day and a refuge and hiding place from the storm and rain i will sing for the one i love a song about his vineyard my loved one had a vineyard on a fertile hillside he dug it up and cleared it of stones and planted it with the choicest vines he built a watchtower in it and cut out a winepress as well then he looked for a crop of good grapes but it yielded only bad fruit now you dwellers in jerusalem and men of judah judge between me and my vineyard what more could have been done for my vineyard than i have done for it when i looked for good grapes why did it yield only bad now i will tell you what i am going to do to my vineyard i will take away its hedge and it will be destroyed i will break down its wall and it will be trampled i will make it a wasteland neither pruned nor cultivated and briers and thorns will grow there i will command the clouds not to rain on it the vineyard of the lord almighty is the house of israel and the men of judah are the garden of his delight and he looked for justice but saw bloodshed for righteousness but heard cries of distress woe to you who add house to house and join field to field till no space is left and you live alone in the land the lord almighty has declared in my hearing surely the great houses will become desolate the fine mansions left without occupants a ten acre vineyard will produce only a bath of wine a homer of seed only an ephah of grain woe to those who rise early in the morning to run after their drinks who stay up late at night till they are inflamed with wine they have harps and lyres at their banquets tambourines and flutes and wine but they have no regard for the deeds of the lord no respect for the work of his hands therefore my people will go into exile for lack of understanding their men of rank will die of hunger and their masses will be parched with thirst therefore the grave enlarges its appetite and opens its mouth without limit into it will descend their nobles and masses with all their brawlers and revelers so man will be brought low and mankind humbled the eyes of the arrogant humbled but the lord almighty will be exalted by his justice and the holy god will show himself holy by his righteousness then sheep will graze as in their own pasture lambs will feed among the ruins of the rich woe to those who draw sin along with cords of deceit and wickedness as with cart ropes to those who say let god hurry let him hasten his work so we may see it let it approach let the plan of the holy one of israel come so we may know it woe to those who call evil good and good evil who put darkness for light and light for darkness who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter woe to those who are wise in their own eyes and clever in their own sight woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine and champions at mixing drinks who acquit the guilty for a bribe but deny justice to the innocent therefore as tongues of fire lick up straw and as dry grass sinks down in the flames so their roots will decay and their flowers blow away like dust for they have rejected the law of the lord almighty and spurned the word of the holy one of israel therefore the lords anger burns against his people his hand is raised and he strikes them down the mountains shake and the dead bodies are like refuse in the streets yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised he lifts up a banner for the distant nations he whistles for those at the ends of the earth here they come swiftly and speedily not one of them grows tired or stumbles not one slumbers or sleeps not a belt is loosened at the waist not a sandal thong is broken their arrows are sharp all their bows are strung their horses hoofs seem like flint their chariot wheels like a whirlwind their roar is like that of the lion they roar like young lions they growl as they seize their prey and carry it off with no one to rescue in that day they will roar over it like the roaring of the sea and if one looks at the land he will see darkness and distress even the light will be darkened by the clouds in the year that king uzziah died i saw the lord seated on a throne high and exalted and the train of his robe filled the temple above him were seraphs each with six wings with two wings they covered their faces with two they covered their feet and with two they were flying and they were calling to one another holy holy holy is the lord almighty the whole earth is full of his glory at the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke woe to me i cried i am ruined for i am a man of unclean lips and i live among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord almighty then one of the seraphs flew to me with a live coal in his hand which he had taken with tongs from the altar with it he touched my mouth and said see this has touched your lips your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for then i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i send and who will go for us and i said here am i send me he said go and tell this people be ever hearing but never understanding be ever seeing but never perceiving make the heart of this people calloused make their ears dull and close their eyes otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and be healed then i said for how long o lord and he answered until the cities lie ruined and without inhabitant until the houses are left deserted and the fields ruined and ravaged until the lord has sent everyone far away and the land is utterly forsaken and though a tenth remains in the land it will again be laid waste but as the terebinth and oak leave stumps when they are cut down so the holy seed will be the stump in the land when ahaz son of jotham the son of uzziah was king of judah king rezin of aram and pekah son of remaliah king of israel marched up to fight against jerusalem but they could not overpower it now the house of david was told aram has allied itself with ephraim so the hearts of ahaz and his people were shaken as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind then the lord said to isaiah go out you and your son shear jashub to meet ahaz at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool on the road to the washermans field say to him be careful keep calm and dont be afraid do not lose heart because of these two smoldering stubs of firewood because of the fierce anger of rezin and aram and of the son of remaliah aram ephraim and remaliahs son have plotted your ruin saying let us invade judah let us tear it apart and divide it among ourselves and make the son of tabeel king over it yet this is what the sovereign lord says it will not take place it will not happen for the head of aram is damascus and the head of damascus is only rezin within sixty five years ephraim will be too shattered to be a people the head of ephraim is samaria and the head of samaria is only remaliahs son if you do not stand firm in your faith you will not stand at all again the lord spoke to ahaz ask the lord your god for a sign whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights but ahaz said i will not ask i will not put the lord to the test then isaiah said hear now you house of david is it not enough to try the patience of men will you try the patience of my god also therefore the lord himself will give you a sign the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him immanuel he will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right but before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste the lord will bring on you and on your people and on the house of your father a time unlike any since ephraim broke away from judah he will bring the king of assyria in that day the lord will whistle for flies from the distant streams of egypt and for bees from the land of assyria they will all come and settle in the steep ravines and in the crevices in the rocks on all the thornbushes and at all the water holes in that day the lord will use a razor hired from beyond the river the king of assyria to shave your head and the hair of your legs and to take off your beards also in that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two goats and because of the abundance of the milk they give he will have curds to eat all who remain in the land will eat curds and honey in that day in every place where there were a thousand vines worth a thousand silver shekels there will be only briers and thorns men will go there with bow and arrow for the land will be covered with briers and thorns as for all the hills once cultivated by the hoe you will no longer go there for fear of the briers and thorns they will become places where cattle are turned loose and where sheep run the lord said to me take a large scroll and write on it with an ordinary pen maher shalal hash baz and i will call in uriah the priest and zechariah son of jeberekiah as reliable witnesses for me then i went to the prophetess and she conceived and gave birth to a son and the lord said to me name him maher shalal hash baz before the boy knows how to say my father or my mother the wealth of damascus and the plunder of samaria will be carried off by the king of assyria the lord spoke to me again because this people has rejected the gently flowing waters of shiloah and rejoices over rezin and the son of remaliah therefore the lord is about to bring against them the mighty floodwaters of the river the king of assyria with all his pomp it will overflow all its channels run over all its banks and sweep on into judah swirling over it passing through it and reaching up to the neck its outspread wings will cover the breadth of your land o immanuel raise the war cry you nations and be shattered listen all you distant lands prepare for battle and be shattered prepare for battle and be shattered devise your strategy but it will be thwarted propose your plan but it will not stand for god is with us the lord spoke to me with his strong hand upon me warning me not to follow the way of this people he said do not call conspiracy everything that these people call conspiracy do not fear what they fear and do not dread it the lord almighty is the one you are to regard as holy he is the one you are to fear he is the one you are to dread and he will be a sanctuary but for both houses of israel he will be a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall and for the people of jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare many of them will stumble they will fall and be broken they will be snared and captured bind up the testimony and seal up the law among my disciples i will wait for the lord who is hiding his face from the house of jacob i will put my trust in him here am i and the children the lord has given me we are signs and symbols in israel from the lord almighty who dwells on mount zion when men tell you to consult mediums and spiritists who whisper and mutter should not a people inquire of their god why consult the dead on behalf of the living to the law and to the testimony if they do not speak according to this word they have no light of dawn distressed and hungry they will roam through the land when they are famished they will become enraged and looking upward will curse their king and their god then they will look toward the earth and see only distress and darkness and fearful gloom and they will be thrust into utter darkness nevertheless there will be no more gloom for those who were in distress in the past he humbled the land of zebulun and the land of naphtali but in the future he will honor galilee of the gentiles by the way of the sea along the jordan the people walking in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned you have enlarged the nation and increased their joy they rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest as men rejoice when dividing the plunder for as in the day of midians defeat you have shattered the yoke that burdens them the bar across their shoulders the rod of their oppressor every warriors boot used in battle and every garment rolled in blood will be destined for burning will be fuel for the fire for to us a child is born to us a son is given and the government will be on his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor mighty god everlasting father prince of peace of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end he will reign on davids throne and over his kingdom establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever the zeal of the lord almighty will accomplish this the lord has sent a message against jacob it will fall on israel all the people will know it ephraim and the inhabitants of samaria who say with pride and arrogance of heart the bricks have fallen down but we will rebuild with dressed stone the fig trees have been felled but we will replace them with cedars but the lord has strengthened rezins foes against them and has spurred their enemies on arameans from the east and philistines from the west have devoured israel with open mouth yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised but the people have not returned to him who struck them nor have they sought the lord almighty so the lord will cut off from israel both head and tail both palm branch and reed in a single day the elders and prominent men are the head the prophets who teach lies are the tail those who guide this people mislead them and those who are guided are led astray therefore the lord will take no pleasure in the young men nor will he pity the fatherless and widows for everyone is ungodly and wicked every mouth speaks vileness yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised surely wickedness burns like a fire it consumes briers and thorns it sets the forest thickets ablaze so that it rolls upward in a column of smoke by the wrath of the lord almighty the land will be scorched and the people will be fuel for the fire no one will spare his brother on the right they will devour but still be hungry on the left they will eat but not be satisfied each will feed on the flesh of his own offspring manasseh will feed on ephraim and ephraim on manasseh together they will turn against judah yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised woe to those who make unjust laws to those who issue oppressive decrees to deprive the poor of their rights and withhold justice from the oppressed of my people making widows their prey and robbing the fatherless what will you do on the day of reckoning when disaster comes from afar to whom will you run for help where will you leave your riches nothing will remain but to cringe among the captives or fall among the slain yet for all this his anger is not turned away his hand is still upraised woe to the assyrian the rod of my anger in whose hand is the club of my wrath i send him against a godless nation i dispatch him against a people who anger me to seize loot and snatch plunder and to trample them down like mud in the streets but this is not what he intends this is not what he has in mind his purpose is to destroy to put an end to many nations are not my commanders all kings he says has not calno fared like carchemish is not hamath like arpad and samaria like damascus as my hand seized the kingdoms of the idols kingdoms whose images excelled those of jerusalem and samaria shall i not deal with jerusalem and her images as i dealt with samaria and her idols when the lord has finished all his work against mount zion and jerusalem he will say i will punish the king of assyria for the willful pride of his heart and the haughty look in his eyes for he says by the strength of my hand i have done this and by my wisdom because i have understanding i removed the boundaries of nations i plundered their treasures like a mighty one i subdued their kings as one reaches into a nest so my hand reached for the wealth of the nations as men gather abandoned eggs so i gathered all the countries not one flapped a wing or opened its mouth to chirp does the ax raise itself above him who swings it or the saw boast against him who uses it as if a rod were to wield him who lifts it up or a club brandish him who is not wood therefore the lord the lord almighty will send a wasting disease upon his sturdy warriors under his pomp a fire will be kindled like a blazing flame the light of israel will become a fire their holy one a flame in a single day it will burn and consume his thorns and his briers the splendor of his forests and fertile fields it will completely destroy as when a sick man wastes away and the remaining trees of his forests will be so few that a child could write them down in that day the remnant of israel the survivors of the house of jacob will no longer rely on him who struck them down but will truly rely on the lord the holy one of israel a remnant will return a remnant of jacob will return to the mighty god though your people o israel be like the sand by the sea only a remnant will return destruction has been decreed overwhelming and righteous the lord the lord almighty will carry out the destruction decreed upon the whole land therefore this is what the lord the lord almighty says o my people who live in zion do not be afraid of the assyrians who beat you with a rod and lift up a club against you as egypt did very soon my anger against you will end and my wrath will be directed to their destruction the lord almighty will lash them with a whip as when he struck down midian at the rock of oreb and he will raise his staff over the waters as he did in egypt in that day their burden will be lifted from your shoulders their yoke from your neck the yoke will be broken because you have grown so fat they enter aiath they pass through migron they store supplies at micmash they go over the pass and say we will camp overnight at geba ramah trembles gibeah of saul flees cry out o daughter of gallim listen o laishah poor anathoth madmenah is in flight the people of gebim take cover this day they will halt at nob they will shake their fist at the mount of the daughter of zion at the hill of jerusalem see the lord the lord almighty will lop off the boughs with great power the lofty trees will be felled the tall ones will be brought low he will cut down the forest thickets with an ax lebanon will fall before the mighty one a shoot will come up from the stump of jesse from his roots a branch will bear fruit the spirit of the lord will rest on him the spirit of wisdom and of understanding the spirit of counsel and of power the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the lord and he will delight in the fear of the lord he will not judge by what he sees with his eyes or decide by what he hears with his ears but with righteousness he will judge the needy with justice he will give decisions for the poor of the earth he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked righteousness will be his belt and faithfulness the sash around his waist the wolf will live with the lamb the leopard will lie down with the goat the calf and the lion and the yearling together and a little child will lead them the cow will feed with the bear their young will lie down together and the lion will eat straw like the ox the infant will play near the hole of the cobra and the young child put his hand into the vipers nest they will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the lord as the waters cover the sea in that day the root of jesse will stand as a banner for the peoples the nations will rally to him and his place of rest will be glorious in that day the lord will reach out his hand a second time to reclaim the remnant that is left of his people from assyria from lower egypt from upper egypt from cush from elam from babylonia from hamath and from the islands of the sea he will raise a banner for the nations and gather the exiles of israel he will assemble the scattered people of judah from the four quarters of the earth ephraims jealousy will vanish and judahs enemies will be cut off ephraim will not be jealous of judah nor judah hostile toward ephraim they will swoop down on the slopes of philistia to the west together they will plunder the people to the east they will lay hands on edom and moab and the ammonites will be subject to them the lord will dry up the gulf of the egyptian sea with a scorching wind he will sweep his hand over the euphrates river he will break it up into seven streams so that men can cross over in sandals there will be a highway for the remnant of his people that is left from assyria as there was for israel when they came up from egypt in that day you will say i will praise you o lord although you were angry with me your anger has turned away and you have comforted me surely god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid the lord the lord is my strength and my song he has become my salvation with joy you will draw water from the wells of salvation in that day you will say give thanks to the lord call on his name make known among the nations what he has done and proclaim that his name is exalted sing to the lord for he has done glorious things let this be known to all the world shout aloud and sing for joy people of zion for great is the holy one of israel among you an oracle concerning babylon that isaiah son of amoz saw raise a banner on a bare hilltop shout to them beckon to them to enter the gates of the nobles i have commanded my holy ones i have summoned my warriors to carry out my wrath those who rejoice in my triumph listen a noise on the mountains like that of a great multitude listen an uproar among the kingdoms like nations massing together the lord almighty is mustering an army for war they come from faraway lands from the ends of the heavens the lord and the weapons of his wrath to destroy the whole country wail for the day of the lord is near it will come like destruction from the almighty because of this all hands will go limp every mans heart will melt terror will seize them pain and anguish will grip them they will writhe like a woman in labor they will look aghast at each other their faces aflame see the day of the lord is coming a cruel day with wrath and fierce anger to make the land desolate and destroy the sinners within it the stars of heaven and their constellations will not show their light the rising sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light i will punish the world for its evil the wicked for their sins i will put an end to the arrogance of the haughty and will humble the pride of the ruthless i will make man scarcer than pure gold more rare than the gold of ophir therefore i will make the heavens tremble and the earth will shake from its place at the wrath of the lord almighty in the day of his burning anger like a hunted gazelle like sheep without a shepherd each will return to his own people each will flee to his native land whoever is captured will be thrust through all who are caught will fall by the sword their infants will be dashed to pieces before their eyes their houses will be looted and their wives ravished see i will stir up against them the medes who do not care for silver and have no delight in gold their bows will strike down the young men they will have no mercy on infants nor will they look with compassion on children babylon the jewel of kingdoms the glory of the babylonians pride will be overthrown by god like sodom and gomorrah she will never be inhabited or lived in through all generations no arab will pitch his tent there no shepherd will rest his flocks there but desert creatures will lie there jackals will fill her houses there the owls will dwell and there the wild goats will leap about hyenas will howl in her strongholds jackals in her luxurious palaces her time is at hand and her days will not be prolonged the lord will have compassion on jacob once again he will choose israel and will settle them in their own land aliens will join them and unite with the house of jacob nations will take them and bring them to their own place and the house of israel will possess the nations as menservants and maidservants in the lords land they will make captives of their captors and rule over their oppressors on the day the lord gives you relief from suffering and turmoil and cruel bondage you will take up this taunt against the king of babylon how the oppressor has come to an end how his fury has ended the lord has broken the rod of the wicked the scepter of the rulers which in anger struck down peoples with unceasing blows and in fury subdued nations with relentless aggression all the lands are at rest and at peace they break into singing even the pine trees and the cedars of lebanon exult over you and say now that you have been laid low no woodsman comes to cut us down the grave below is all astir to meet you at your coming it rouses the spirits of the departed to greet you all those who were leaders in the world it makes them rise from their thrones all those who were kings over the nations they will all respond they will say to you you also have become weak as we are you have become like us all your pomp has been brought down to the grave along with the noise of your harps maggots are spread out

stretched out and who can turn it back this oracle came in the year king ahaz died do not rejoice all you philistines that the rod that struck you is broken from the root of that snake will spring up

its temple to its high places to weep moab wails over nebo and medeba every head is shaved and every beard cut off in the streets they wear sackcloth on the roofs and in the public squares they all wail prostrate with weeping heshbon and elealeh cry out their voices are heard all the way to jahaz therefore the armed men of moab cry out and their hearts are faint my heart cries out over moab her fugitives flee as far as zoar as far as eglath shelishiyah they go up the way to luhith weeping as they go on the road to horonaim they lament their destruction the waters of nimrim are dried up and the grass is withered the vegetation is gone and nothing green is left so the wealth they have acquired and stored up they carry away over the ravine of the poplars their outcry echoes along the border of moab their wailing reaches as far as eglaim their lamentation as far as beer elim dimons waters are full of blood but i will bring still more upon dimon a lion upon the fugitives of moab and upon those who remain in the land send lambs as tribute to the ruler of the land from sela across the desert to the mount of the daughter of zion like fluttering birds pushed from the nest so are the women of moab at the fords of the arnon give us counsel render a decision make your shadow like night at high noon hide the fugitives do not betray the refugees let the moabite fugitives stay with you be their shelter from the destroyer the oppressor will come to an end and destruction will cease the aggressor will vanish from the land in love a throne will be established in faithfulness a man will sit on it one from the house of david one who in judging seeks justice and speeds the cause of righteousness we have heard of moabs pride her overweening pride and conceit her pride and her insolence but her boasts are empty therefore the moabites wail they wail together for moab lament and grieve for the men of kir hareseth the fields of heshbon wither the vines of sibmah also the rulers of the nations have trampled down the choicest vines which once reached jazer and spread toward the desert their shoots spread out and went as far as the sea so i weep as jazer weeps for the vines of sibmah o heshbon o elealeh i drench you with tears the shouts of joy over your ripened fruit and over your harvests have been stilled joy and gladness are taken away from the orchards no one sings or shouts in the vineyards no one treads out wine at the presses for i have put an end to the shouting my heart laments for moab like a harp my inmost being for kir hareseth when moab appears at her high place she only wears herself out when she goes to her shrine to pray it is to no avail this is the word the lord has already spoken concerning moab but now the lord says within three years as a servant bound by contract would count them moabs splendor and all her many people will be despised and her survivors will be very few and feeble an oracle concerning damascus see damascus will no longer be a city but will become a heap of ruins the cities of aroer will be deserted and left to flocks which will lie down with no one to make them afraid the fortified city will disappear from ephraim and royal power from damascus the remnant of aram will be like the glory of the israelites declares the lord almighty in that day the glory of jacob will fade the fat of his body will waste away it will be as when a reaper gathers the standing grain and harvests the grain with his arm as when a man gleans heads of grain in the valley of rephaim yet some gleanings will remain as when an olive tree is beaten leaving two or three olives on the topmost branches four or five on the fruitful boughs declares the lord the god of israel in that day men will look to their maker and turn their eyes to the holy one of israel they will not look to the altars the work of their hands and they will have no regard for the asherah poles and the incense altars their fingers have made in that day their strong cities which they left because of the israelites will be like places abandoned to thickets and undergrowth and all will be desolation you have forgotten god your savior you have not remembered the rock your fortress therefore though you set out the finest plants and plant imported vines though on the day you set them out you make them grow and on the morning when you plant them you bring them to bud yet the harvest will be as nothing in the day of disease and incurable pain oh the raging of many nations they rage like the raging sea oh the uproar of the peoples they roar like the roaring of great waters although the peoples roar like the roar of surging waters when he rebukes them they flee far away driven before the wind like chaff on the hills like tumbleweed before a gale in the evening sudden terror before the morning they are gone this is the portion of those who loot us the lot of those who plunder us woe to the land of whirring wings along the rivers of cush which sends envoys by sea in papyrus boats over the water go swift messengers to a people tall and smooth skinned to a people feared far and wide an aggressive nation of strange speech whose land is divided by rivers all you people of the world you who live on the earth when a banner is raised on the mountains you will see it and when a trumpet sounds you will hear it this is what the lord says to me i will remain quiet and will look on from my dwelling place like shimmering heat in the sunshine like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest for before the harvest when the blossom is gone and the flower becomes a ripening grape he will cut off the shoots with pruning knives and cut down and take away the spreading branches they will all be left to the mountain birds of prey and to the wild animals the birds will feed on them all summer the wild animals all winter at that time gifts will be brought to the lord almighty from a people tall and smooth skinned from a people feared far and wide an aggressive nation of strange speech whose land is divided by rivers the gifts will be brought to mount zion the place of the name of the lord almighty an oracle concerning egypt see the lord rides on

mediums and the spiritists i will hand the egyptians over to the power of a cruel master and a fierce king will rule over them declares the lord the lord almighty the waters of the river will dry up and the riverbed will be parched and dry the canals will stink the streams of egypt will dwindle and dry up the reeds and rushes will wither also the plants along the nile at the mouth of the river every sown field along the nile will become parched will blow away and be no more the fishermen will groan and lament all who cast hooks into the nile those who throw nets on the water will pine away those who work with combed flax will despair the weavers of fine linen will lose hope the workers in cloth will be dejected and all the wage earners will be sick at heart the officials of zoan are nothing but fools the wise counselors of pharaoh give senseless advice how can you say to pharaoh i am one of the wise men a disciple of the ancient kings where are your wise men now let them show you and make known what the lord almighty has planned against egypt the officials of zoan have become fools the leaders of memphis are deceived the cornerstones of her peoples have led egypt astray the lord has poured into them a spirit of dizziness they make egypt stagger in all that she does as a drunkard staggers around in his vomit there is nothing egypt can do head or tail palm branch or reed in that day the egyptians will be like women they will shudder with fear at the uplifted hand that the lord almighty raises against them and the land of judah will bring terror to the egyptians everyone to whom judah is mentioned will be terrified because of what the lord almighty is planning against them in that day five cities in egypt will speak the language of canaan and swear allegiance to the lord almighty one of them will be called the city of destruction in that day there will be an altar to the lord in the heart of egypt and a monument to the lord at its border it will be a sign and witness to the lord almighty in the land of egypt when they cry out to the lord because of their oppressors he will send them a savior and defender and he will rescue them so the lord will make himself known to the egyptians and in that day they will acknowledge the lord they will worship with sacrifices and grain offerings they will make vows to the lord and keep them the lord will strike egypt with a plague he will strike them and heal them they will turn to the lord and he will respond to their pleas and heal them in that day there will be a highway from egypt to assyria the assyrians will go to egypt and the egyptians to assyria the egyptians and assyrians will worship together in that day israel will be the third along with egypt and assyria a blessing on the earth the lord almighty will bless them saying blessed be egypt my people assyria my handiwork and israel my inheritance in the year that the supreme commander sent by sargon king of assyria came to ashdod and attacked and captured it at that time the lord spoke through isaiah son of amoz he said to him take off the sackcloth from your body and the sandals from your feet and he did so going around stripped and barefoot then the lord said just as my servant isaiah has gone stripped and barefoot for three years as a sign and portent against egypt and cush so the king of assyria will lead away stripped and barefoot the egyptian captives and cushite exiles young and old with buttocks bared to egypts shame those who trusted in cush and boasted in egypt will be afraid and put to shame in that day the people who live on this coast will say see what has happened to those we relied on those we fled to for help and deliverance from the king of assyria how then can we escape an oracle concerning the desert by the sea like whirlwinds sweeping through the southland an invader comes from the desert from a land of terror a dire vision has been shown to me the traitor betrays the looter takes loot

would ask then ask and come back yet again an oracle concerning arabia you caravans of dedanites who camp in the thickets of arabia bring water for the thirsty you who live in tema bring food for the fugitives they flee from the sword from the drawn sword from the bent bow and from the heat of battle this is what the lord says to me within one year as a servant bound by contract would count it all the pomp of kedar will come to an end the survivors of the bowmen the warriors of kedar will be few the lord the god of israel has spoken an oracle concerning the valley of vision what troubles you now that you have all gone up on the roofs o town full of commotion o city of tumult and revelry your slain were not killed by the sword nor did they die in battle all your leaders have fled together they have been captured without using the bow all you who were caught were taken prisoner together having fled while the enemy was still far away therefore i said turn away from me let me weep bitterly do not try to console me over the destruction of my people the lord the lord almighty has a day of tumult and trampling and terror in the valley of vision a day of battering down walls and of crying out to the mountains elam takes up the quiver with her charioteers and horses kir uncovers the shield your choicest valleys are full of chariots and horsemen are posted at the city gates the defenses of judah are stripped away and you looked in that day to the weapons in the palace of the forest you saw that the city of david had many breaches in its defenses you stored up water in the lower pool you counted the buildings in jerusalem and tore down houses to strengthen the wall you built a reservoir between the two walls for the water of the old pool but you did not look to the one who made it or have regard for the one who planned it long ago the lord the lord almighty called you on that day to weep and to wail to tear out your hair and put on sackcloth but see there is joy and revelry slaughtering of cattle and killing of sheep eating of meat and drinking of wine let us eat and drink you say for tomorrow we die the lord almighty has revealed this in my hearing till your dying day this sin will not be atoned for says the lord the lord almighty this is what the lord the lord almighty says go say to this steward to shebna who is in charge of the palace what are you doing here and who gave you permission to cut out a grave for yourself here hewing your grave on the height and chiseling your resting place in the rock beware the lord is about to take firm hold of you and hurl you away o you mighty man he will roll you up tightly like a ball and throw you into a large country there you will die and there your splendid chariots will remain you disgrace to your masters house i will depose you from your office and you will be ousted from your position in that day i will summon my servant eliakim son of hilkiah i will clothe him with your robe and fasten your sash around him and hand your authority over to him he will be a father to those who live in jerusalem and to the house of judah i will place on his shoulder the key to the house of david what he opens no one can shut and what he shuts no one can open i will drive him like a peg into a firm place he will be a seat of honor for the house of his father all the glory of his family will hang on him its offspring and offshoots all its lesser vessels from the bowls to all the jars in that day declares the lord almighty the peg driven into the firm place will give way it will be sheared off and will fall and the load hanging on it will be cut down the lord has spoken an oracle concerning tyre wail o ships of tarshish for tyre is destroyed and left without house or harbor from the land of cyprus word has come to them be silent you people of the island and you merchants of sidon whom the seafarers have enriched on the great waters came the grain of the shihor the harvest of the nile was the revenue of tyre and she became the marketplace of the nations be ashamed o sidon and you o fortress of the sea for the sea has spoken i have neither been in labor nor given birth i have neither reared sons nor brought up daughters when word comes to egypt they will be in anguish at the report from tyre cross over to tarshish wail you people of the island is this your city of revelry the old old city whose feet have taken her to settle in far off lands who planned this against tyre the bestower of crowns whose merchants are princes whose traders are renowned in the earth the lord almighty planned it to bring low the pride of all glory and to humble all who are renowned on the earth till your land as along the nile o daughter of tarshish for you no longer have a harbor the lord has stretched out his hand over the sea and made its kingdoms tremble he has given an order concerning phoenicia that her fortresses be destroyed he said no more of your reveling o virgin daughter of sidon now crushed up cross over to cyprus even there you will find no rest look at the land of the babylonians this people that is now of no account the assyrians have made it a place for desert creatures they raised up their siege towers they stripped its fortresses bare and turned it into a ruin wail you ships of tarshish your fortress is destroyed at that time tyre will be forgotten for seventy years the span of a kings life but at the end of these seventy years it will happen to tyre as in the song of the prostitute take up a harp walk through the city o prostitute forgotten play the harp well sing many a song so that you will be remembered at the end of seventy years the lord will deal with tyre she will return to her hire as a prostitute and will ply her trade with all the kingdoms on the face of the earth yet her profit and her earnings will be set apart for the lord they will not be stored up or hoarded her profits will go to those who live before the lord for abundant food and fine clothes see the lord is going to lay waste the earth and devastate it he will ruin its face and scatter its inhabitants it will be the same for priest as for people for master as for servant for mistress as for maid for seller as for buyer for borrower as for lender for debtor as for creditor the earth will be completely laid waste and totally plundered the lord has spoken this word the earth dries up and withers the world languishes and withers the exalted of the earth languish the earth is defiled by its people they have disobeyed the laws violated the statutes and broken the everlasting covenant therefore a curse consumes the earth its people must bear their guilt therefore earths inhabitants are burned up and very few are left the new wine dries up and the vine withers all the merrymakers groan the gaiety of the tambourines is stilled the noise of the revelers has stopped the joyful harp is silent no longer do they drink wine with a song the beer is bitter to its drinkers the ruined city lies desolate the entrance to every house is barred in the streets they cry out for wine all joy turns to gloom all gaiety is banished from the earth the city is left in ruins its gate is battered to pieces so will it be on the earth and among the nations as when an olive tree is beaten or as when gleanings are left after the grape harvest they raise their voices they shout for joy from the west they acclaim the lords majesty therefore in the east give glory to the lord exalt the name of the lord the god of israel in the islands of the sea from the ends of the earth we hear singing glory to the righteous one but i said i waste away i waste away woe to me the treacherous betray with treachery the treacherous betray terror and pit and snare await you o people of the earth whoever flees at the sound of terror will fall into a pit whoever climbs out of the pit will be caught in a snare the floodgates of the heavens are opened the foundations of the earth shake the earth is broken up the earth is split asunder the earth is thoroughly shaken the earth reels like a drunkard it sways like a hut in the wind so heavy upon it is the guilt of its rebellion that it falls never to rise again in that day the lord will punish the powers in the heavens above and the kings on the earth below they will be herded together like prisoners bound in a dungeon they will be shut up in prison and be punished after many days the moon will be abashed the sun ashamed for the lord almighty will reign on mount zion and in jerusalem and before its elders gloriously o lord you are my god i will exalt you and praise your name for in perfect faithfulness you have done marvelous things things planned long ago you have made the city a heap of rubble the fortified town a ruin the foreigners stronghold a city no more it will never be rebuilt therefore strong peoples will honor you cities of ruthless nations will revere you you have been a refuge for the poor a refuge for the needy in his distress a shelter from the storm and a shade from the heat for the breath of the ruthless is like a storm driving against a wall and like the heat of the desert you silence the uproar of foreigners as heat is reduced by the shadow of a cloud so the song of the ruthless is stilled on this mountain the lord almighty will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples a banquet of aged wine the best of meats and the finest of wines on this mountain he will destroy the shroud that enfolds all peoples the sheet that covers all nations he will swallow up death forever the sovereign lord will wipe away the tears from all faces he will remove the disgrace of his people from all the earth the lord has spoken in that day they will say surely this is our god we trusted in him and he saved us this is the lord we trusted in him let us rejoice and be glad in his salvation the hand of the lord will rest on this mountain but moab will be trampled under him as straw is trampled down in the manure they will spread out their hands in it as a swimmer spreads out his hands to swim god will bring down their pride despite the cleverness of their hands he will bring down your high fortified walls and lay them low he will bring them down to the ground to the very dust in that day this song will be sung in the land of judah we have a strong city god makes salvation its walls and ramparts open the gates that the righteous nation may enter the nation that keeps faith you will keep in perfect peace him whose mind is steadfast because he trusts in you trust in the lord forever for the lord the lord is the rock eternal he humbles those who dwell on high he lays the lofty city low he levels it to the ground and casts it down to the dust feet trample it down the feet of the oppressed the footsteps of the poor the path of the righteous is level o upright one you make the way of the righteous smooth yes lord walking in the way of your laws we wait for you your name and renown are the desire of our hearts my soul yearns for you in the night in the morning my spirit longs for you when your judgments come upon the earth the people of the world learn righteousness though grace is shown to the wicked they do not learn righteousness even in a land of uprightness they go on doing evil and regard not the majesty of the lord o lord your hand is lifted high but they do not see it let them see your zeal for your people and be put to shame let the fire reserved for your enemies consume them lord you establish peace for us all that we have accomplished you have done for us o lord our god other lords besides you have ruled over us but your name alone do we honor they are now dead they live no more those departed spirits do not rise you punished them and brought them to ruin you wiped out all memory of them you have enlarged the nation o lord you have enlarged the nation you have gained glory for yourself you have extended all the borders of the land lord they came to you in their distress when you disciplined them they could barely whisper a prayer as a woman with child and about to give birth writhes and cries out in her pain so were we in your presence o lord we were with child we writhed in pain but we gave birth to wind we have not brought salvation to the earth we have not given birth to people of the world but your dead will live their bodies will rise you who dwell in the dust wake up and shout for joy your dew is like the dew of the morning the earth will give birth to her dead go my people enter your rooms and shut the doors behind you hide yourselves for a little while until his wrath has passed by see the lord is coming out of his dwelling to punish the people of the earth for their sins the earth will disclose the blood shed upon her she will conceal her slain no longer in that day the lord will punish with his sword his fierce great and powerful sword leviathan the gliding serpent leviathan the coiling serpent he will slay the monster of the sea in that day sing about a fruitful vineyard i the lord watch over it i water it continually i guard it day and night so that no one may harm it i am not angry if only there were briers and thorns confronting me i would march against them in battle i would set them all on fire or else let them come to me for refuge let them make peace with me yes let them make peace with me in days to come jacob will take root israel will bud and blossom and fill all the world with fruit has the lord struck her as he struck down those who struck her has she been killed as those were killed who killed her by warfare and exile you contend with her with his fierce blast he drives her out as on a day the east wind blows by this then will jacobs guilt be atoned for and this will be the full fruitage of the removal of his sin when he makes all the altar stones to be like chalk stones crushed to pieces no asherah poles or incense altars will be left standing the fortified city stands desolate an abandoned settlement forsaken like the desert there the calves graze there they lie down they strip its branches bare when its twigs are dry they are broken off and women come and make fires with them for this is a people without understanding so their maker has no compassion on them and their creator shows them no favor in that day the lord will thresh from the flowing euphrates to the wadi of egypt and you o israelites will be gathered up one by one and in that day a great trumpet will sound those who were perishing in assyria and those who were exiled in egypt will come and worship the lord on the holy mountain in jerusalem woe to that wreath the pride of ephraims drunkards to the fading flower his glorious beauty set on the head of a fertile valley to that city the pride of those laid low by wine see the lord has one who is powerful and strong like a hailstorm and a destructive wind like a driving rain and a flooding downpour he will throw it forcefully to the ground that wreath the pride of ephraims drunkards will be trampled underfoot that fading flower his glorious beauty set on the head of a fertile valley will be like a fig ripe before harvest as soon as someone sees it and takes it in his hand he swallows it in that day the lord almighty will be a glorious crown a beautiful wreath for the remnant of his people he will be a spirit of justice to him who sits in judgment a source of strength to those who turn back the battle at the gate and these also stagger from wine and reel from beer priests and prophets stagger from beer and are befuddled with wine they reel from beer they stagger when seeing visions they stumble when rendering decisions all the tables are covered with vomit and there is not a spot without filth who is it he is trying to teach to whom is he explaining his message to children weaned from their milk to those just taken from the breast for it is do and do do and do rule on rule rule on rule a little here a little there very well then with foreign lips and strange tongues god will speak to this people to whom he said this is the resting place let the weary rest and this is the place of repose but they would not listen so then the word of the lord to them will become do and do do and do rule on rule rule on rule a little here a little there so that they will go and fall backward be injured and snared and captured therefore hear the word of the lord you scoffers who rule this people in jerusalem you boast we have entered into a covenant with death with the grave we have made an agreement when an overwhelming scourge sweeps by it cannot touch us for we have made a lie our refuge and falsehood our hiding place so this is what the sovereign lord says see i lay a stone in zion a tested stone a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation the one who trusts will never be dismayed i will make justice the measuring line and righteousness the plumb line hail will sweep away your refuge the lie and water will overflow your hiding place your covenant with death will be annulled your agreement with the grave will not stand when the overwhelming scourge sweeps by you will be beaten down by it as often as it comes it will carry you away morning after morning by day and by night it will sweep through the understanding of this message will bring sheer terror the bed is too short to stretch out on the blanket too narrow to wrap around you the lord will rise up as he did at mount perazim he will rouse himself as in the valley of gibeon to do his work his strange work and perform his task his alien task now stop your mocking or your chains will become heavier the lord the lord almighty has told me of the destruction decreed against the whole land listen and hear my voice pay attention and hear what i say when a farmer plows for planting does he plow continually does he keep on breaking up and harrowing the soil when he has leveled the surface does he not sow caraway and scatter cummin does he not plant wheat in its place barley in its plot and spelt in its field his god instructs him and teaches him the right way caraway is not threshed with a sledge nor is a cartwheel rolled over cummin caraway is beaten out with a rod and cummin with a stick grain must be ground to make bread so one does not go on threshing it forever though he drives the wheels of his threshing cart over it his horses do not grind it all this also comes from the lord almighty wonderful in counsel and magnificent in wisdom woe to you ariel ariel the city where david settled add year to year and let your cycle of festivals go on yet i will besiege ariel she will mourn and lament she will be to me like an altar hearth i will encamp against you all around i will encircle you with towers and set up my siege works against you brought low you will speak from the ground your speech will mumble out of the dust your voice will come ghostlike from the earth out of the dust your speech will whisper but your many enemies will become like fine dust the ruthless hordes like blown chaff suddenly in an instant the lord almighty will come with thunder and earthquake and great noise with windstorm and tempest and flames of a devouring fire then the hordes of all the nations that fight against ariel that attack her and her fortress and besiege her will be as it is with a dream with a vision in the night as when a hungry man dreams that he is eating but he awakens and his hunger remains as when a thirsty man dreams that he is drinking but he awakens faint with his thirst unquenched so will it be with the hordes of all the nations that fight against mount zion be stunned and amazed blind yourselves and be sightless be drunk but not from wine stagger but not from beer the lord has brought over you a deep sleep he has sealed your eyes the prophets he has covered your heads the seers for you this whole vision is nothing but words sealed in a scroll and if you give the scroll to someone who can read and say to him read this please he will answer i cant it is sealed or if you give the scroll to someone who cannot read and say read this please he will answer i dont know how to read the lord says these people come near to me with their mouth and honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me their worship of me is made up only of rules taught by men therefore once more i will astound these people with wonder upon wonder the wisdom of the wise will perish the intelligence of the intelligent will vanish woe to those who go to great depths to hide their plans from the lord who do their work in darkness and think who sees us who will know you turn things upside down as if the potter were thought to be like the clay shall what is formed say to him who formed it he did not make me can the pot say of the potter he knows nothing in a very short time will not lebanon be turned into a fertile field and the fertile field seem like a forest in that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see once more the humble will rejoice in the lord the needy will rejoice in the holy one of israel the ruthless will vanish the mockers will disappear and all who have an eye for evil will be cut down those who with a word make a man out to be guilty who ensnare the defender in court and with false testimony deprive the innocent of justice therefore this is what the lord who redeemed abraham says to the house of jacob no longer will jacob be ashamed no longer will their faces grow pale when they see among them their children the work of my hands they will keep my name holy they will acknowledge the holiness of the holy one of jacob and will stand in awe of the god of israel those who are wayward in spirit will gain understanding those who complain will accept instruction woe to the obstinate children declares the lord to those who carry out plans that are not mine forming an alliance but not by my spirit heaping sin upon sin who go down to egypt without consulting me who look for help to pharaohs protection to egypts shade for refuge but pharaohs protection will be to your shame egypts shade will bring you disgrace though they have officials in zoan and their envoys have arrived in hanes everyone will be put to shame because of a people useless to them who bring neither help nor advantage but only shame and disgrace an oracle concerning the animals of the negev through a land of hardship and distress of lions and lionesses of adders and darting snakes the envoys carry their riches on donkeys backs their treasures on the humps of camels to that unprofitable nation to egypt whose help is utterly useless therefore i call her rahab the do nothing go now write it on a tablet for them inscribe it on a scroll that for the days to come it may be an everlasting witness these are rebellious people deceitful children children unwilling to listen to the lords instruction they say to the seers see no more visions and to the prophets give us no more visions of what is right tell us pleasant things prophesy illusions leave this way get off this path and stop confronting us with the holy one of israel therefore this is what the holy one of israel says because you have rejected this message relied on oppression and depended on deceit this sin will become for you like a high wall cracked and bulging that collapses suddenly in an instant it will break in pieces like pottery shattered so mercilessly that among its pieces not a fragment will be found for taking coals from a hearth or scooping water out of a cistern this is what the sovereign lord the holy one of israel says in repentance and rest is your salvation in quietness and trust is your strength but you would have none of it you said no we will flee on horses therefore you will flee you said we will ride off on swift horses therefore your pursuers will be swift a thousand will flee at the threat of one at the threat of five you will all flee away till you are left like a flagstaff on a mountaintop like a banner on a hill yet the lord longs to be gracious to you he rises to show you compassion for the lord is a god of justice blessed are all who wait for him o people of zion who live in jerusalem you will weep no more how gracious he will be when you cry for help as soon as he hears he will answer you although the lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction your teachers will be hidden no more with your own eyes you will see them whether you turn to the right or to the left your ears will hear a voice behind you saying this is the way walk in it then you will defile your idols overlaid with silver and your images covered with gold you will throw them away like a menstrual cloth and say to them away with you he will also send you rain for the seed you sow in the ground and the food that comes from the land will be rich and plentiful in that day your cattle will graze in broad meadows the oxen and donkeys that work the soil will eat fodder and mash spread out with fork and shovel in the day of great slaughter when the towers fall streams of water will flow on every high mountain and every lofty hill the moon will shine like the sun and the sunlight will be seven times brighter like the light of seven full days when the lord binds up the bruises of his people and heals the wounds he inflicted see the name of the lord comes from afar with burning anger and dense clouds of smoke his lips are full of wrath and his tongue is a consuming fire his breath is like a rushing torrent rising up to the neck he shakes the nations in the sieve of destruction he places in the jaws of the peoples a bit that leads them astray and you will sing as on the night you celebrate a holy festival your hearts will rejoice as when people go up with flutes to the mountain of the lord to the rock of israel the lord will cause men to hear his majestic voice and will make them see his arm coming down with raging anger and consuming fire with cloudburst thunderstorm and hail the voice of the lord will shatter assyria with his scepter he will strike them down every stroke the lord lays on them with his punishing rod will be to the music of tambourines and harps as he fights them in battle with the blows of his arm topheth has long been prepared it has been made ready for the king its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood the breath of the lord like a stream of burning sulfur sets it ablaze woe to those who go down to egypt for help who rely on horses who trust in the multitude of their chariots and in the great strength of their horsemen but do not look to the holy one of israel or seek help from the lord yet he too is wise and can bring disaster he does not take back his words he will rise up against the house of the wicked against those who help evildoers but the egyptians are men and not god their horses are flesh and not spirit when the lord stretches out his hand he who helps will stumble he who is helped will fall both will perish together this is what the lord says to me as a lion growls a great lion over his prey and though a whole band of shepherds is called together against him he is not frightened by their shouts or disturbed by their clamor so the lord almighty will come down to do battle on mount zion and on its heights like birds hovering overhead the lord almighty will shield jerusalem he will shield it and deliver it he will pass over it and will rescue it return to him you have so greatly revolted against o israelites for in that day every one of you will reject the idols of silver and gold your sinful hands have made assyria will fall by a sword that is not of man a sword not of mortals will devour them they will flee before the sword and their young men will be put to forced labor their stronghold will fall because of terror at sight of the battle standard their commanders will panic declares the lord whose fire is in zion whose furnace is in jerusalem see a king will reign in righteousness and rulers will rule with justice each man will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land then the eyes of those who see will no longer be closed and the ears of those who hear will listen the mind of the rash will know and understand and the stammering tongue will be fluent and clear no longer will the fool be called noble nor the scoundrel be highly respected for the fool speaks folly his mind is busy with evil he practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the lord the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water the scoundrels methods are wicked he makes up evil schemes to destroy the poor with lies even when the plea of the needy is just but the noble man makes noble plans and by noble deeds he stands you women who are so complacent rise up and listen to me you daughters who feel secure hear what i have to say in little more than a year you who feel secure will tremble the grape harvest will fail and the harvest of fruit will not come tremble you complacent women shudder you daughters who feel secure strip off your clothes put sackcloth around your waists beat your breasts for the pleasant fields for the fruitful vines and for the land of my people a land overgrown with thorns and briers yes mourn for all houses of merriment and for this city of revelry the fortress will be abandoned the noisy city deserted citadel and watchtower will become a wasteland forever the delight of donkeys a pasture for flocks till the spirit is poured upon us from on high and the desert becomes a fertile field and the fertile field seems like a forest justice will dwell in the desert and righteousness live in the fertile field the fruit of righteousness will be peace the effect of righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever my people will live in peaceful dwelling places in secure homes in undisturbed places of rest though hail flattens the forest and the city is leveled completely how blessed you will be sowing your seed by every stream and letting your cattle and donkeys range free woe to you o destroyer you who have not been destroyed woe to you o traitor you who have not been betrayed when you stop destroying you will be destroyed when you stop betraying you will be betrayed o lord be gracious to us we long for you be our strength every morning our salvation in time of distress at the thunder of your voice the peoples flee when you rise up the nations scatter your plunder o nations is harvested as by young locusts like a swarm of locusts men pounce on it the lord is exalted for he dwells on high he will fill zion with justice and righteousness he will be the sure foundation for your times a rich store of salvation and wisdom and knowledge the fear of the lord is the key to this treasure look their brave men cry aloud in the streets the envoys of peace weep bitterly the highways are deserted no travelers are on the roads the treaty is broken its witnesses are despised no one is respected the land mourns and wastes away lebanon is ashamed and withers sharon is like the arabah and bashan and carmel drop their leaves now will i arise says the lord now will i be exalted now will i be lifted up you conceive chaff you give birth to straw your breath is a fire that consumes you the peoples will be burned as if to lime like cut thornbushes they will be set ablaze you who are far away hear what i have done you who are near acknowledge my power the sinners in zion are terrified trembling grips the godless who of us can dwell with the consuming fire who of us can dwell with everlasting burning he who walks righteously and speaks what is right who rejects gain from extortion and keeps his hand from accepting bribes who stops his ears against plots of murder and shuts his eyes against contemplating evil this is the man who will dwell on the heights whose refuge will be the mountain fortress his bread will be supplied and water will not fail him your eyes will see the king in his beauty and view a land that stretches afar in your thoughts you will ponder the former terror where is that chief officer where is the one who took the revenue where is the officer in charge of the towers you will see those arrogant people no more those people of an obscure speech with their strange incomprehensible tongue look upon zion the city of our festivals your eyes will see jerusalem a peaceful abode a tent that will not be moved its stakes will never be pulled up nor any of its ropes broken there the lord will be our mighty one it will be like a place of broad rivers and streams no galley with oars will ride them no mighty ship will sail them for the lord is our judge the lord is our lawgiver the lord is our king it is he who will save us your rigging hangs loose the mast is not held secure the sail is not spread then an abundance of spoils will be divided and even the lame will carry off plunder no one living in zion will say i am ill and the sins of those who dwell there will be forgiven come near you nations and listen pay attention you peoples let the earth hear and all that is in it the world and all that comes out of it the lord is angry with all nations his wrath is upon all their armies he will totally destroy them he will give them over to slaughter their slain will be thrown out their dead bodies will send up a stench the mountains will be soaked with their blood all the stars of the heavens will be dissolved and the sky rolled up like a scroll all the starry host will fall like withered leaves from the vine like shriveled figs from the fig tree my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens see it descends in judgment on edom the people i have totally destroyed the sword of the lord is bathed in blood it is covered with fat the blood of lambs and goats fat from the kidneys of rams for the lord has a sacrifice in bozrah and a great slaughter in edom and the wild oxen will fall with them the bull calves and the great bulls their land will be drenched with blood and the dust will be soaked with fat for the lord has a day of vengeance a year of retribution to uphold zions cause edoms streams will be turned into pitch her dust into burning sulfur her land will become blazing pitch it will not be quenched night and day its smoke will rise forever from generation to generation it will lie desolate no one will ever pass through it again the desert owl and screech owl will possess it the great owl and the raven will nest there god will stretch out over edom the measuring line of chaos and the plumb line of desolation her nobles will have nothing there to be called a kingdom all her princes will vanish away thorns will overrun her citadels nettles and brambles her strongholds she will become a haunt for jackals a home for owls desert creatures will meet with hyenas and wild goats will bleat to each other there the night creatures will also repose and find for themselves places of rest the owl will nest there and lay eggs she will hatch them and care for her young under the shadow of her wings there also the falcons will gather each with its mate look in the scroll of the lord and read none of these will be missing not one will lack her mate for it is his mouth that has given the order and his spirit will gather them together he allots their portions his hand distributes them by measure they will possess it forever and dwell there from generation to generation the desert and the parched land will be glad the wilderness will rejoice and blossom like the crocus it will burst into bloom it will rejoice greatly and shout for joy the glory of lebanon will be given to it the splendor of carmel and sharon they will see the glory of the lord the splendor of our god strengthen the feeble hands steady the knees that give way say to those with fearful hearts be strong do not fear your god will come he will come with vengeance with divine retribution he will come to save you then will the eyes of the blind be opened and the ears of the deaf unstopped then will the lame leap like a deer and the mute tongue shout for joy water will gush forth in the wilderness and streams in the desert the burning sand will become a pool the thirsty ground bubbling springs in the haunts where jackals once lay grass and reeds and papyrus will grow and a highway will be there it will be called the way of holiness the unclean will not journey on it it will be for those who walk in that way wicked fools will not go about on it no lion will be there nor will any ferocious beast get up on it they will not be found there but only the redeemed will walk there and the ransomed of the lord will return they will enter zion with singing everlasting joy will crown their heads gladness and joy will overtake them and sorrow and sighing will flee away in the fourteenth year of king hezekiahs reign sennacherib king of assyria attacked all the fortified cities of judah and captured them then the king of assyria sent his field commander with a large army from lachish to king hezekiah at jerusalem when the commander stopped at the aqueduct of the upper pool on the road to the washermans field eliakim son of hilkiah the palace administrator shebna the secretary and joah son of asaph the recorder went out to him the field commander said to them tell hezekiah this is what the great king the king of assyria says on what are you basing this confidence of yours you say you have strategy and military strength but you speak only empty words on whom are you depending that you rebel against me look now you are depending on egypt that splintered reed of a staff which pierces a mans hand and wounds him if he leans on it such is pharaoh king of egypt to all who depend on him and if you say to me we are depending on the lord our god isnt he the one whose high places and altars hezekiah removed saying to judah and jerusalem you must worship before this altar come now make a bargain with my master the king of assyria i will give you two thousand horses if you can put riders on them how then can you repulse one officer of the least of my masters officials even though you are depending on egypt for chariots and horsemen furthermore have i come to attack and destroy this land without the lord the lord himself told me to march against this country and destroy it then eliakim shebna and joah said to the field commander please speak to your servants in aramaic since we understand it dont speak to us in hebrew in the hearing of the people on the wall but the commander replied was it only to your master and you that my master sent me to say these things and not to the men sitting on the wall who like you will have to eat their own filth and drink their own urine then the commander stood and called out in hebrew hear the words of the great king the king of assyria this is what the king says do not let hezekiah deceive you he cannot deliver you do not let hezekiah persuade you to trust in the lord when he says the lord will surely deliver us this city will not be given into the hand of the king of assyria do not listen to hezekiah this is what the king of assyria says make peace with me and come out to me then every one of you will eat from his own vine and fig tree and drink water from his own cistern until i come and take you to a land like your own a land of grain and new wine a land of bread and vineyards do not let hezekiah mislead you when he says the lord will deliver us has the god of any nation ever delivered his land from the hand of the king of assyria where are the gods of hamath and arpad where are the gods of sepharvaim have they rescued samaria from my hand who of all the gods of these countries has been able to save his land from me how then can the lord deliver jerusalem from my hand but the people remained silent and said nothing in reply because the king had commanded do not answer him then eliakim son of hilkiah the palace administrator shebna the secretary and joah son of asaph the recorder went to hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what the field commander had said when king hezekiah heard this he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and went into the temple of the lord he sent eliakim the palace administrator shebna the secretary and the leading priests all wearing sackcloth to the prophet isaiah son of amoz they told him this is what hezekiah says this day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them it may be that the lord your god will hear the words of the field commander whom his master the king of assyria has sent to ridicule the living god and that he will rebuke him for the words the lord your god has heard therefore pray for the remnant that still survives when king hezekiahs officials came to isaiah isaiah said to them tell your master this is what the lord says do not be afraid of what you have heard those words with which the underlings of the king of assyria have blasphemed me listen i am going to put a spirit in him so that when he hears a certain report he will return to his own country and there i will have him cut down with the sword when the field commander heard that the king of assyria had left lachish he withdrew and found the king fighting against libnah now sennacherib received a report that tirhakah the cushite king of egypt was marching out to fight against him when he heard it he sent messengers to hezekiah with this word say to hezekiah king of judah do not let the god you depend on deceive you when he says jerusalem will not be handed over to the king of assyria surely you have heard what the kings of assyria have done to all the countries destroying them completely and will you be delivered did the gods of the nations that were destroyed by my forefathers deliver them the gods of gozan haran rezeph and the people of eden who were in tel assar where is the king of hamath the king of arpad the king of the city of sepharvaim or of hena or ivvah hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it then he went up to the temple of the lord and spread it out before the lord and hezekiah prayed to the lord o lord almighty god of israel enthroned between the cherubim you alone are god over all the kingdoms of the earth you have made heaven and earth give ear o lord and hear open your eyes o lord and see listen to all the words sennacherib has sent to insult the living god it is true o lord that the assyrian kings have laid waste all these peoples and their lands they have thrown their gods into the fire and destroyed them for they were not gods but only wood and stone fashioned by human hands now o lord our god deliver us from his hand so that all kingdoms on earth may know that you alone o lord are god then isaiah son of amoz sent a message to hezekiah this is what the lord the god of israel says because you have prayed to me concerning sennacherib king of assyria this is the word the lord has spoken against him the virgin daughter of zion despises and mocks you the daughter of jerusalem tosses her head as you flee who is it you have insulted and blasphemed against whom have you raised your voice and lifted your eyes in pride against the holy one of israel by your messengers you have heaped insults on the lord and you have said with my many chariots i have ascended the heights of the mountains the utmost heights of lebanon i have cut down its tallest cedars the choicest of its pines i have reached its remotest heights the finest of its forests i have dug wells in foreign lands and drunk the water there with the soles of my feet i have dried up all the streams of egypt have you not heard long ago i ordained it in days of old i planned it now i have brought it to pass that you have turned fortified cities into piles of stone their people drained of power are dismayed and put to shame they are like plants in the field like tender green shoots like grass sprouting on the roof scorched before it grows up but i know where you stay and when you come and go and how you rage against me because you rage against me and because your insolence has reached my ears i will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth and i will make you return by the way you came this will be the sign for you o hezekiah this year you will eat what grows by itself and the second year what springs from that but in the third year sow and reap plant vineyards and eat their fruit once more a remnant of the house of judah will take root below and bear fruit above for out of jerusalem will come a remnant and out of mount zion a band of survivors the zeal of the lord almighty will accomplish this therefore this is what the lord says concerning the king of assyria he will not enter this city or shoot an arrow here he will not come before it with shield or build a siege ramp against it by the way that he came he will return he will not enter this city declares the lord i will defend this city and save it for my sake and for the sake of david my servant then the angel of the lord went out and put to death a hundred and eighty five thousand men in the assyrian camp when the people got up the next morning there were all the dead bodies so sennacherib king of assyria broke camp and withdrew he returned to nineveh and stayed there one day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god nisroch his sons adrammelech and sharezer cut him down with the sword and they escaped to the land of ararat and esarhaddon his son succeeded him as king in those days hezekiah became ill and was at the point of death the prophet isaiah son of amoz went to him and said this is what the lord says put your house in order because you are going to die you will not recover hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the lord remember o lord how i have walked before you faithfully and with wholehearted devotion and have done what is good in your eyes and hezekiah wept bitterly then the word of the lord came to isaiah go and tell hezekiah this is what the lord the god of your father david says i have heard your prayer and seen your tears i will add fifteen years to your life and i will deliver you and this city from the hand of the king of assyria i will defend this city this is the lords sign to you that the lord will do what he has promised i will make the shadow cast by the sun go back the ten steps it has gone down on the stairway of ahaz so the sunlight went back the ten steps it had gone down a writing of hezekiah king of judah after his illness and recovery i said in the prime of my life must i go through the gates of death and be robbed of the rest of my years i said i will not again see the lord the lord in the land of the living no longer will i look on mankind or be with those who now dwell in this world like a shepherds tent my house has been pulled down and taken from me like a weaver i have rolled up my life and he has cut me off from the loom day and night you made an end of me i waited patiently till dawn but like a lion he broke all my bones day and night you made an end of me i cried like a swift or thrush i moaned like a mourning dove my eyes grew weak as i looked to the heavens i am troubled o lord come to my aid but what can i say he has spoken to me and he himself has done this i will walk humbly all my years because of this anguish of my soul lord by such things men live and my spirit finds life in them too you restored me to health and let me live surely it was for my benefit that i suffered such anguish in your love you kept me from the pit of destruction you have put all my sins behind your back for the grave cannot praise you death cannot sing your praise those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your faithfulness the living the living they praise you as i am doing today fathers tell their children about your faithfulness the lord will save me and we will sing with stringed instruments all the days of our lives in the temple of the lord isaiah had said prepare a poultice of figs and apply it to the boil and he will recover hezekiah had asked what will be the sign that i will go up to the temple of the lord at that time merodach baladan son of baladan king of babylon sent hezekiah letters and a gift because he had heard of his illness and recovery hezekiah received the envoys gladly and showed them what was in his storehouses the silver the gold the spices the fine oil his entire armory and everything found among his treasures there was nothing in his palace or in all his kingdom that hezekiah did not show them then isaiah the prophet went to king hezekiah and asked what did those men say and where did they come fromfrom a distant land hezekiah replied they came to me from babylon the prophet asked what did they see in your palacethey saw everything in my palace hezekiah said there is nothing among my treasures that i did not show them then isaiah said to hezekiah hear the word of the lord almighty the time will surely come when everything in your palace and all that your fathers have stored up until this day will be carried off to babylon nothing will be left says the lord and some of your descendants your own flesh and blood who will be born to you will be taken away and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of babylon the word of the lord you have spoken is good hezekiah replied for he thought there will be peace and security in my lifetime comfort comfort my people says your god speak tenderly to jerusalem and proclaim to her that her hard service has been completed that her sin has been paid for that she has received from the lords hand double for all her sins a voice of one calling in the desert prepare the way for the lord make straight in the wilderness a highway for our god every valley shall be raised up every mountain and hill made low the rough ground shall become level the rugged places a plain and the glory of the lord will be revealed and all mankind together will see it for the mouth of the lord has spoken a voice says cry out and i said what shall i cryall men are like grass and all their glory is like the flowers of the field the grass withers and the flowers fall because the breath of the lord blows on them surely the people are grass the grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of our god stands forever you who bring good tidings to zion go up on a high mountain you who bring good tidings to jerusalem lift up your voice with a shout lift it up do not be afraid say to the towns of judah here is your god see the sovereign lord comes with power and his arm rules for him see his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him he tends his flock like a shepherd he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart he gently leads those that have young who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand or with the breadth of his hand marked off the heavens who has held the dust of the earth in a basket or weighed the mountains on the scales and the hills in a balance who has understood the mind of the lord or instructed him as his counselor whom did the lord consult to enlighten him and who taught him the right way who was it that taught him knowledge or showed him the path of understanding surely the nations are like a drop in a bucket they are regarded as dust on the scales he weighs the islands as though they were fine dust lebanon is not sufficient for altar fires nor its animals enough for burnt offerings before him all the nations are as nothing they are regarded by him as worthless and less than nothing to whom then will you compare god what image will you compare him to as for an idol a craftsman casts it and a goldsmith overlays it with gold and fashions silver chains for it a man too poor to present such an offering selects wood that will not rot he looks for a skilled craftsman to set up an idol that will not topple do you not know have you not heard has it not been told you from the beginning have you not understood since the earth was founded he sits enthroned above the circle of the earth and its people are like grasshoppers he stretches out the heavens like a canopy and spreads them out like a tent to live in he brings princes to naught and reduces the rulers of this world to nothing no sooner are they planted no sooner are they sown no sooner do they take root in the ground than he blows on them and they wither and a whirlwind sweeps them away like chaff to whom will you compare me or who is my equal says the holy one lift your eyes and look to the heavens who created all these he who brings out the starry host one by one and calls them each by name because of his great power and mighty strength not one of them is missing why do you say o jacob and complain o israel my way is hidden from the lord my cause is disregarded by my god do you not know have you not heard the lord is the everlasting god the creator of the ends of the earth he will not grow tired or weary and his understanding no one can fathom he gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak even youths grow tired and weary and young men stumble and fall but those who hope in the lord will renew their strength they will soar on wings like eagles they will run and not grow weary they will walk and not be faint be silent before me you islands let the nations renew their strength let them come forward and speak let us meet together at the place of judgment who has stirred up one from the east calling him in righteousness to his service he hands nations over to him and subdues kings before him he turns them to dust with his sword to windblown chaff with his bow he pursues them and moves on unscathed by a path his feet have not traveled before who has done this and carried it through calling forth the generations from the beginning i the lord with the first of them and with the last i am he the islands have seen it and fear the ends of the earth tremble they approach and come forward each helps the other and says to his brother be strong the craftsman encourages the goldsmith and he who smooths with the hammer spurs on him who strikes the anvil he says of the welding it is good he nails down the idol so it will not topple but you o israel my servant jacob whom i have chosen you descendants of abraham my friend i took you from the ends of the earth from its farthest corners i called you i said you are my servant i have chosen you and have not rejected you so do not fear for i am with you do not be dismayed for i am your god i will strengthen you and help you i will uphold you with my righteous right hand all who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced those who oppose you will be as nothing and perish though you search for your enemies you will not find them those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all for i am the lord your god who takes hold of your right hand and says to you do not fear i will help you do not be afraid o worm jacob o little israel for i myself will help you declares the lord your redeemer the holy one of israel see i will make you into a threshing sledge new and sharp with many teeth you will thresh the mountains and crush them and reduce the hills to chaff you will winnow them the wind will pick them up and a gale will blow them away but you will rejoice in the lord and glory in the holy one of israel the poor and needy search for water but there is none their tongues are parched with thirst but i the lord will answer them i the god of israel will not forsake them i will make rivers flow on barren heights and springs within the valleys i will turn the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into springs i will put in the desert the cedar and the acacia the myrtle and the olive i will set pines in the wasteland the fir and the cypress together so that people may see and know may consider and understand that the hand of the lord has done this that the holy one of israel has created it present your case says the lord set forth your arguments says jacobs king bring in your idols to tell us what is going to happen tell us what the former things were so that we may consider them and know their final outcome or declare to us the things to come tell us what the future holds so we may know that you are gods do something whether good or bad so that we will be dismayed and filled with fear but you are less than nothing and your works are utterly worthless he who chooses you is detestable i have stirred up one from the north and he comes one from the rising sun who calls on my name he treads on rulers as if they were mortar as if he were a potter treading the clay who told of this from the beginning so we could know or beforehand so we could say he was right no one told of this no one foretold it no one heard any words from you i was the first to tell zion look here they are i gave to jerusalem a messenger of good tidings i look but there is no one no one among them to give counsel no one to give answer when i ask them see they are all false their deeds amount to nothing their images are but wind and confusion here is my servant whom i uphold my chosen one in whom i delight i will put my spirit on him and he will bring justice to the nations he will not shout or cry out or raise his voice in the streets a bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out in faithfulness he will bring forth justice he will not falter or be discouraged till he establishes justice on earth in his law the islands will put their hope this is what god the lord says he who created the heavens and stretched them out who spread out the earth and all that comes out of it who gives breath to its people and life to those who walk on it i the lord have called you in righteousness i will take hold of your hand i will keep you and will make you to be a covenant for the people and a light for the gentiles to open eyes that are blind to free captives from prison and to release from the dungeon those who sit in darkness i am the lord that is my name i will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols see the former things have taken place and new things i declare before they spring into being i announce them to you sing to the lord a new song his praise from the ends of the earth you who go down to the sea and all that is in it you islands and all who live in them let the desert and its towns raise their voices let the settlements where kedar lives rejoice let the people of sela sing for joy let them shout from the mountaintops let them give glory to the lord and proclaim his praise in the islands the lord will march out like a mighty man like a warrior he will stir up his zeal with a shout he will raise the battle cry and will triumph over his enemies for a long time i have kept silent i have been quiet and held myself back but now like a woman in childbirth i cry out i gasp and pant i will lay waste the mountains and hills and dry up all their vegetation i will turn rivers into islands and dry up the pools i will lead the blind by ways they have not known along unfamiliar paths i will guide them i will turn the darkness into light before them and make the rough places smooth these are the things i will do i will not forsake them but those who trust in idols who say to images you are our gods will be turned back in utter shame hear you deaf look you blind and see who is blind but my servant and deaf like the messenger i send who is blind like the one committed to me blind like the servant of the lord you have seen many things but have paid no attention your ears are open but you hear nothing it pleased the lord for the sake of his righteousness to make his law great and glorious but this is a people plundered and looted all of them trapped in pits or hidden away in prisons they have become plunder with no one to rescue them they have been made loot with no one to say send them back which of you will listen to this or pay close attention in time to come who handed jacob over to become loot and israel to the plunderers was it not the lord against whom we have sinned for they would not follow his ways they did not obey his law so he poured out on them his burning anger the violence of war it enveloped them in flames yet they did not understand it consumed them but they did not take it to heart but now this is what the lord says he who created you o jacob he who formed you o israel fear not for i have redeemed you i

idol which can profit him nothing he and his kind will be put to shame craftsmen are nothing but men let them all come together and take their stand they will be brought down to terror and infamy the blacksmith takes a tool and works with it in the coals he shapes an idol with hammers he forges it with the might of his arm he gets hungry and loses his strength he drinks no water and grows faint the carpenter measures with a line and makes an outline with a marker he roughs it out with chisels and marks it with compasses he shapes it in the form of man of man in all his glory that it may dwell in a shrine he cut down cedars or perhaps took a cypress or oak he let it grow among the trees of the forest or planted a pine and the rain made it grow it is mans fuel for burning some of it he takes and warms himself he kindles a fire and bakes bread but he also fashions a god and worships it he makes an idol and bows down to it half of the wood he burns in the fire over it he prepares his meal he roasts his meat and eats his fill he also warms himself and says ah i am warm i see the fire from the rest he makes a god his idol he bows down to it and worships he prays to it and says save me you are my god they know nothing they understand nothing their eyes are plastered over so they cannot see and their minds closed so they cannot understand no one stops to think no one has the knowledge or understanding to say half of it i used for fuel i even baked bread over its coals i roasted meat and i ate shall i make a detestable thing from what is left shall i bow down to a block of

be inhabited of the towns of judah they shall be built and of their ruins i will restore them who says to the watery deep be dry and i will dry up your streams who says of cyrus he is my shepherd and

the lord for the wicked listen to me you islands hear this you distant nations before i was born the lord called me from my birth he has made mention of my name he made my mouth like a sharpened sword in the shadow of his hand he hid me he made me into a polished arrow and concealed me in his quiver he said to me you are my servant israel in whom i will display my splendor but i said i have labored to no purpose i have spent my strength in vain and for nothing yet what is due me is in the lords hand and my reward is with my god and now the lord says he who formed me in the womb to be his servant to bring jacob back to him and gather israel to himself for i am honored in the eyes of the lord and my god has been my strength he says it is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore the tribes of jacob and bring back those of israel i have kept i will also make you a light for the gentiles that you may bring my salvation to the ends of the earth this is what the lord says the redeemer and holy one of israel to him who was despised and abhorred by the nation to the servant of rulers kings will see you and rise up princes will see and bow down because of the lord who is faithful the holy one of israel who has chosen you this is what the lord says in the time of my favor i will answer you and in the day of salvation i will help you i will keep you and will make you to

bereaved and barren i was exiled and rejected who brought these up i was left all alone but these where have they come from this is what the sovereign lord says see i will beckon to the gentiles i

strength to rescue you by a mere rebuke i dry up the sea i turn rivers into a desert their fish rot for lack of water and die of thirst i clothe the sky with darkness and make sackcloth its covering the sovereign lord has given me an instructed tongue to know the word that sustains the weary he wakens me morning by morning wakens my ear to listen like one being taught the sovereign lord has opened my ears and i have not been rebellious i have not drawn back i offered my back to those who beat me my cheeks to those who pulled out my beard i did not hide my face from mocking and spitting because the sovereign lord helps me i will not be disgraced therefore have i set my face like flint and i know i will not be put to shame he who vindicates me is near who then will bring charges against me let us face each other who is my accuser let him confront me it is the sovereign lord who helps me who is he that will condemn me they will all wear out like a garment the moths will eat them up who among you fears the lord and obeys the word of his servant let him who walks in the dark who has no light trust in the name of the lord and rely on his god but now all you who light fires and provide yourselves with flaming torches go walk in the light of your fires and of the torches you have set ablaze this is what you shall receive from my hand you will lie down in torment listen to me you who pursue righteousness and who seek the lord look to the rock from which you were cut and to the quarry from which you were hewn look to abraham your father and to sarah who gave you birth

righteousness will never fail hear me you who know what is right you people who have my law in your hearts do not fear the reproach of men or be terrified by their insults for the moth will eat them up like a garment the worm will devour them like wool but my righteousness will last forever my salvation through all generations awake awake clothe yourself with strength o arm of the lord awake as in days gone by as in generations of old was it not you who cut rahab to pieces who pierced that monster through was it not you who dried up the sea the waters of the great deep who made a road in the depths of the sea so that the redeemed might cross over the ransomed of the lord will return they will enter zion with singing everlasting joy will crown their heads gladness and joy will overtake them and sorrow and sighing will flee away i even i am he who comforts you who are you that you fear mortal men the sons of men who are but grass that you forget the lord your maker who stretched out the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth that you live in constant terror every day because of the wrath of the oppressor who is bent on destruction for where is the wrath of the oppressor the cowering prisoners will soon be set free they will not die in their dungeon nor will they lack bread for i am the lord your god who churns up the sea so that its waves roar the lord almighty is his name i have put my words in your mouth and covered you with the shadow of my hand i who set the heavens in place who laid the foundations of the earth and who say to zion you are my people awake awake rise up o jerusalem you who have drunk from the hand of the lord the cup of his wrath you who have drained to its dregs the goblet that makes men stagger of all the sons she bore there was none to guide her of all the sons she reared there was none to take her by the hand these double calamities have come upon you who can comfort you ruin and destruction famine and sword who can console you your sons have fainted they lie at the head of every street like antelope caught in a net they are filled with the wrath of the lord and the rebuke of your god therefore hear this you afflicted one made drunk but not with wine this is what your sovereign lord says your god who defends his people see i have taken out of your hand the cup that made you stagger from that cup the goblet of my wrath you will never drink again i will put it into the hands of your tormentors who said to you fall prostrate that we may walk over you and you made your back like the ground like a street to be walked over awake awake o zion clothe yourself with strength put on your garments of splendor o jerusalem the holy city the uncircumcised and defiled will not enter you again shake off your dust rise up sit enthroned o jerusalem free yourself from the chains on your neck o captive daughter of zion for this is what the lord says you were sold for nothing and without money you will be redeemed for this is what the sovereign lord says at first my people went down to egypt to live lately assyria has oppressed them and now what do i have here declares the lord for my people have been taken away for nothing and those who rule them mock declares the lord and all day long my name is constantly blasphemed therefore my people will know my name therefore in that day they will know that it is i who foretold it yes it is i how beautiful on the mountains are the feet of those who bring good news who proclaim peace who bring good tidings who proclaim salvation who say to zion your god reigns listen your watchmen lift up their voices together they shout for joy when the lord returns to zion they will see it with their own eyes burst into songs of joy together you ruins of jerusalem for the lord has comforted his people he has redeemed jerusalem the lord will lay bare his holy arm in the sight of all the nations and all the ends of the earth will see the salvation of our god depart depart go out from there touch no unclean thing come out from it and be pure you who carry the vessels of the lord but you will not leave in haste or go in flight for the lord will go before you the god of israel will be your rear guard see my servant will act wisely he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted just as there were many who were appalled at him his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man and his form marred beyond human likeness so will he sprinkle many nations and kings will shut their mouths because of him for what they were not told they will see and what they have not heard they will understand who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed he grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of dry ground he had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him nothing in his appearance that we should desire him he was despised and rejected by men a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering like one from whom men hide their faces he was despised and we esteemed him not surely he took up our infirmities and carried our sorrows yet we considered him stricken by god smitten by him and afflicted but he was pierced for our transgressions he was crushed for our iniquities the punishment that brought us peace was upon him and by his wounds we are healed we all like sheep have gone astray each of us has turned to his own way and the lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all he was oppressed and afflicted yet he did not open his mouth he was led like a lamb to the slaughter and as a sheep before her shearers is silent so he did not open his mouth by oppression and judgment he was taken away and who can speak of his descendants for he was cut off from the land of the living for the transgression of my people he was stricken he was assigned a grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death though he had done no violence nor was any deceit in his mouth yet it was the lords will to crush him and cause him to suffer and though the lord makes his life a guilt offering he will see his offspring and prolong his days and the will of the lord will prosper in his hand after the suffering of his soul he will see the light of life and be satisfied by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many and he will bear their iniquities therefore i will give him a portion among the great and he will divide the spoils with the strong because he poured out his life unto death and was numbered with the transgressors for he bore the sin of many and made intercession for the transgressors sing o barren woman you who never bore a child burst into song shout for joy you who were never in labor because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband says the lord enlarge the place of your tent stretch your tent curtains wide do not hold back lengthen your cords strengthen your stakes for you will spread out to the right and to the left your descendants will dispossess nations and settle in their desolate cities do not be afraid you will not suffer shame do not fear disgrace you will not be humiliated you will forget the shame of your youth and remember no more the reproach of your widowhood for your maker is your husband the lord almighty is his name the holy one of israel is your redeemer he is called the god of all the earth the lord will call you back as if you were a wife deserted and distressed in spirit a wife who married young only to be rejected says your god for a brief moment i abandoned you but with deep compassion i will bring you back in a surge of anger i hid my face from you for a moment but with everlasting kindness i will have compassion on you says the lord your redeemer to me this is like the days of noah when i swore that the waters of noah would never again cover the earth so now i have sworn not to be angry with you never to rebuke you again though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my covenant of peace be removed says the lord who has compassion on you o afflicted city lashed by storms and not comforted i will build you with stones of turquoise your foundations with sapphires i will make your battlements of rubies your gates of sparkling jewels and all your walls of precious stones all your sons will be taught by the lord and great will be your childrens peace in righteousness you will be established tyranny will be far from you you will have nothing to fear terror will be far removed it will not come near you if anyone does attack you it will not be my doing whoever attacks you will surrender to you see it is i who created the blacksmith who fans the coals into flame and forges a weapon fit for its work and it is i who have created the destroyer to work havoc no weapon forged against you will prevail and you will refute every tongue that accuses you this is the heritage of the servants of the lord and this is their vindication from me declares the lord come all you who are thirsty come to the waters and you who have no money come buy and eat come buy wine and milk without money and without cost why spend money on what is not bread and your labor on what does not satisfy listen listen to me and eat what is good and your soul will delight in the richest of fare give ear and come to me hear me that your soul may live i will make an everlasting covenant with you my faithful love promised to david see i have made him a witness to the peoples a leader and commander of the peoples surely you will summon nations you know not and nations that do not know you will hasten to you because of the lord your god the holy one of israel for he has endowed you with splendor seek the lord while he may be found call on him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and the evil man his thoughts let him turn to the lord and he will have mercy on him and to our god for he will freely pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways declares the lord as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts as the rain and the snow come down from heaven and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish so that it yields seed for the sower and bread for the eater so is my word that goes out from my mouth it will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it you will go out in joy and be led forth in peace the mountains and hills will burst into song before you and all the trees of the field will clap their hands instead of the thornbush will grow the pine tree and instead of briers the myrtle will grow this will be for the lords renown for an everlasting sign which will not be destroyed this is what the lord says maintain justice and do what is right for my salvation is close at hand and my righteousness will soon be revealed blessed is the man who does this the man who holds it fast who keeps the sabbath without desecrating it and keeps his hand from doing any evil let no foreigner who has bound himself to the lord say the lord will surely exclude me from his people and let not any eunuch complain i am only a dry tree for this is what the lord says to the eunuchs who keep my sabbaths who choose what pleases me and hold fast to my covenant to them i will give within my temple and its walls a memorial and a name better than sons and daughters i will give them an everlasting name that will not be cut off and foreigners who bind themselves to the lord to serve him to love the name of the lord and to worship him all who keep the sabbath without desecrating it and who hold fast to my covenant these i will bring to my holy mountain and give them joy in my house of prayer their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on my altar for my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations the sovereign lord declares he who gathers the exiles of israel i will gather still others to them besides those already gathered come all you beasts of the field come and devour all you beasts of the forest israels watchmen are blind they all lack knowledge they are all mute dogs they cannot bark they lie around and dream they love to sleep they are dogs with mighty appetites they never have enough they are shepherds who lack understanding they all turn to their own way each seeks his own gain come each one cries let me get wine let us drink our fill of beer and tomorrow will be like today or even far better the righteous perish and no one ponders it in his heart devout men are taken away and no one understands that the righteous are taken away to be spared from evil those who walk uprightly enter into peace they find rest as they lie in death but you come here you sons of a sorceress you offspring of adulterers and prostitutes whom are you mocking at whom do you sneer and stick out your tongue are you not a brood of rebels the offspring of liars you burn with lust among the oaks and under every spreading tree you sacrifice your children in the ravines and under the overhanging crags the idols among the smooth stones of the ravines are your portion they they are your lot yes to them you have poured out drink offerings and offered grain offerings in the light of these things should i relent you have made your bed on a high and lofty hill there you went up to offer your sacrifices behind your doors and your doorposts you have put your pagan symbols forsaking me you uncovered your bed you climbed into it and opened it wide you made a pact with those whose beds you love and you looked on their nakedness you went to molech with olive oil and increased your perfumes you sent your ambassadors far away you descended to the grave itself you were wearied by all your ways but you would not say it is hopeless you found renewal of your strength and so you did not faint whom have you so dreaded and feared that you have been false to me and have neither remembered me nor pondered this in your hearts is it not because i have long been silent that you do not fear me i will expose your righteousness and your works and they will not benefit you when you cry out for help let your collection of idols save you the wind will carry all of them off a mere breath will blow them away but the man who makes me his refuge will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain and it will be said build up build up prepare the road remove the obstacles out of the way of my people for this is what the high and lofty one says he who lives forever whose name is holy i live in a high and holy place but also with him who is contrite and lowly in spirit to revive the spirit of the lowly and to revive the heart of the contrite i will not accuse forever nor will i always be angry for then the spirit of man would grow faint before me the breath of man that i have created i was enraged by his sinful greed i punished him and hid my face in anger yet he kept on in his willful ways i have seen his ways but i will heal him i will guide him and restore comfort to him creating praise on the lips of the mourners in israel peace peace to those far and near says the lord and i will heal them but the wicked are like the tossing sea which cannot rest whose waves cast up mire and mud there is no peace says my god for the wicked shout it aloud do not hold back raise your voice like a trumpet declare to my people their rebellion and to the house of jacob their sins for day after day they seek me out they seem eager to know my ways as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its god they ask me for just decisions and seem eager for god to come near them why have we fasted they say and you have not seen it why have we humbled ourselves and you have not noticedyet on the day of your fasting you do as you please and exploit all your workers your fasting ends in quarreling and strife and in striking each other with wicked fists you cannot fast as you do today and expect your voice to be heard on high is this the kind of fast i have chosen only a day for a man to humble himself is it only for bowing ones head like a reed and for lying on sackcloth and ashes is that what you call a fast a day acceptable to the lord is not this the kind of fasting i have chosen to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke to set the oppressed free and break every yoke is it not to share your food with the hungry and to provide the poor wanderer with shelter when you see the naked to clothe him and not to turn away from your own flesh and blood then your light will break forth like the dawn and your healing will quickly appear then your righteousness will go before you and the glory of the lord will be your rear guard then you will call and the lord will answer you will cry for help and he will say here am i if you do away with the yoke of oppression with the pointing finger and malicious talk and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noonday the lord will guide you always he will satisfy your needs in a sun scorched land and will strengthen your frame you will be like a well watered garden like a spring whose waters never fail your people will rebuild the ancient ruins and will raise up the age old foundations you will be called repairer of broken walls restorer of streets with dwellings if you keep your feet from breaking the sabbath and from doing as you please on my holy day if you call the sabbath a delight and the lords holy day honorable and if you honor it by not going your own way and not doing as you please or speaking idle words then you will find your joy in the lord and i will cause you to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance of your father jacob the mouth of the lord has spoken surely the arm of the lord is not too short to save nor his ear too dull to hear but your iniquities have separated you from your god your sins have hidden his face from you so that he will not hear for your hands are stained with blood your fingers with guilt your lips have spoken lies and your tongue mutters wicked things no one calls for justice no one pleads his case with integrity they rely on empty arguments and speak lies they conceive trouble and give birth to evil they hatch the eggs of vipers and spin a spiders web whoever eats their eggs will die and when one is broken an adder is hatched their cobwebs are useless for clothing they cannot cover themselves with what they make their deeds are evil deeds and acts of violence are in their hands their feet rush into sin they are swift to shed innocent blood their thoughts are evil thoughts ruin and destruction mark their ways the way of peace they do not know there is no justice in their paths they have turned them into crooked roads no one who walks in them will know peace so justice is far from us and righteousness does not reach us we look for light but all is darkness for brightness but we walk in deep shadows like the blind we grope along the wall feeling our way like men without eyes at midday we stumble as if it were twilight among the strong we are like the dead we all growl like bears we moan mournfully like doves we look for justice but find none for deliverance but it is far away for our offenses are many in your sight and our sins testify against us our offenses are ever with us and we acknowledge our iniquities rebellion and treachery against the lord turning our backs on our god fomenting oppression and revolt uttering lies our hearts have conceived so justice is driven back and righteousness stands at a distance truth has stumbled in the streets honesty cannot enter truth is nowhere to be found and whoever shuns evil becomes a prey the lord looked and was displeased that there was no justice he saw that there was no one he was appalled that there was no one to intervene so his own arm worked salvation for him and his own righteousness sustained him he put on righteousness as his breastplate and the helmet of salvation on his head he put on the garments of vengeance and wrapped himself in zeal as in a cloak according to what they have done so will he repay wrath to his enemies and retribution to his foes he will repay the islands their due from the west men will fear the name of the lord and from the rising of the sun they will revere his glory for he will come like a pent up flood that the breath of the lord drives along the redeemer will come to zion to those in jacob who repent of their sins declares the lord as for me this is my covenant with them says the lord my spirit who is on you and my words that i have put in your mouth will not depart from your mouth or from the mouths of your children or from the mouths of their descendants from this time on and forever says the lord arise shine for your light has come and the glory of the lord rises upon you see darkness covers the earth and thick darkness is over the peoples but the lord rises upon you and his glory appears over you nations will come to your light and kings to the brightness of your dawn lift up your eyes and look about you all assemble and come to you your sons come from afar and your daughters are carried on the arm then you will look and be radiant your heart will throb and swell with joy the wealth on the seas will be brought to you to you the riches of the nations will come herds of camels will cover your land young camels of midian and ephah and all from sheba will come bearing gold and incense and proclaiming the praise of the lord all kedars flocks will be gathered to you the rams of nebaioth will serve you they will be accepted as offerings on my altar and i will adorn my glorious temple who are these that fly along like clouds like doves to their nests surely the islands look to me in the lead are the ships of tarshish bringing your sons from afar with their silver and gold to the honor of the lord your god the holy one of israel for he has endowed you with splendor foreigners will rebuild your walls and their kings will serve you though in anger i struck you in favor i will show you compassion your gates will always stand open they will never be shut day or night so that men may bring you the wealth of the nations their kings led in triumphal procession for the nation or kingdom that will not serve you will perish it will be utterly ruined the glory of lebanon will come to you the pine the fir and the cypress together to adorn the place of my sanctuary and i will glorify the place of my feet the sons of your oppressors will come bowing before you all who despise you will bow down at your feet and will call you the city of the lord zion of the holy one of israel although you have been forsaken and hated with no one traveling through i will make you the everlasting pride and the joy of all generations you will drink the milk of nations and be nursed at royal breasts then you will know that i the lord am your savior your redeemer the mighty one of jacob instead of bronze i will bring you gold and silver in place of iron instead of wood i will bring you bronze and iron in place of stones i will make peace your governor and righteousness your ruler no longer will violence be heard in your land nor ruin or destruction within your borders but you will call your walls salvation and your gates praise the sun will no more be your light by day nor will the brightness of the moon shine on you for the lord will be your everlasting light and your god will be your glory your sun will never set again and your moon will wane no more the lord will be your everlasting light and your days of sorrow will end then will all your people be righteous and they will possess the land forever they are the shoot i have planted the work of my hands for the display of my splendor the least of you will become a thousand the smallest a mighty nation i am the lord in its time i will do this swiftly the spirit of the sovereign lord is on me because the lord has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners to proclaim the year of the lords favor and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all who mourn and provide for those who grieve in zion to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes the oil of gladness instead of mourning and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair they will be called oaks of righteousness a planting of the lord for the display of his splendor they will rebuild the ancient ruins and restore the places long devastated they will renew the ruined cities that have been devastated for generations aliens will shepherd your flocks foreigners will work your fields and vineyards and you will be called priests of the lord you will be named ministers of our god you will feed on the wealth of nations and in their riches you will boast instead of their shame my people will receive a double portion and instead of disgrace they will rejoice in their inheritance and so they will inherit a double portion in their land and everlasting joy will be theirs for i the lord love justice i hate robbery and iniquity in my faithfulness i will reward them and make an everlasting covenant with them their descendants will be known among the nations and their offspring among the peoples all who see them will acknowledge that they are a people the lord has blessed i delight greatly in the lord my soul rejoices in my god for he has clothed me with garments of salvation and arrayed me in a robe of righteousness as a bridegroom adorns his head like a priest and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels for as the soil makes the sprout come up and a garden causes seeds to grow so the sovereign lord will make righteousness and praise spring up before all nations for zions sake i will not keep silent for jerusalems sake i will not remain quiet till her righteousness shines out like the dawn her salvation like a blazing torch the nations will see your righteousness and all kings your glory you will be called by a new name that the mouth of the lord will bestow you will be a crown of splendor in the lords hand a royal diadem in the hand of your god no longer will they call you deserted or name your land desolate but you will be called hephzibah and your land beulah for the lord will take delight in you and your land will be married as a young man marries a maiden so will your sons marry you as a bridegroom rejoices over his bride so will your god rejoice over you i have posted watchmen on your walls o jerusalem they will never be silent day or night you who call on the lord give yourselves no rest and give him no rest till he establishes jerusalem and makes her the praise of the earth the lord has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm never again will i give your grain as food for your enemies and never again will foreigners drink the new wine for which you have toiled but those who harvest it will eat it and praise the lord and those who gather the grapes will drink it in the courts of my sanctuary pass through pass through the gates prepare the way for the people build up build up the highway remove the stones raise a banner for the nations the lord has made proclamation to the ends of the earth say to the daughter of zion see your savior comes see his reward is with him and his recompense accompanies him they will be called the holy people the redeemed of the lord and you will be called sought after the city no longer deserted who is this coming from edom from bozrah with his garments stained crimson who is this robed in splendor striding forward in the greatness of his strength it is i speaking in righteousness mighty to save why are your garments red like those of one treading the winepress i have trodden the winepress alone from the nations no one was with me i trampled them in my anger and trod them down in my wrath their blood spattered my garments and i stained all my clothing for the day of vengeance was in my heart and the year of my redemption has come i looked but there was no one to help i was appalled that no one gave support so my own arm worked salvation for me and my own wrath sustained me i trampled the nations in my anger in my wrath i made them drunk and poured their blood on the ground i will tell of the kindnesses of the lord the deeds for which he is to be praised according to all the lord has done for us yes the many good things he has done for the house of israel according to his compassion and many kindnesses he said surely they are my people sons who will not be false to me and so he became their savior in all their distress he too was distressed and the angel of his presence saved them in his love and mercy he redeemed them he lifted them up and carried them all the days of old yet they rebelled and grieved his holy spirit so he turned and became their enemy and he himself fought against them then his people recalled the days of old the days of moses and his people where is he who brought them through the sea with the shepherd of his flock where is he who set his holy spirit among them who sent his glorious arm of power to be at moses right hand who divided the waters before them to gain for himself everlasting renown who led them through the depths like a horse in open country they did not stumble like cattle that go down to the plain they were given rest by the spirit of the lord this is how you guided your people to make for yourself a glorious name look down from heaven and see from your lofty throne holy and glorious where are your zeal and your might your tenderness and compassion are withheld from us but you are our father though abraham does not know us or israel acknowledge us you o lord are our father our redeemer from of old is your name why o lord do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts so we do not revere you return for the sake of your servants the tribes that are your inheritance for a little while your people possessed your holy place but now our enemies have trampled down your sanctuary we are yours from of old but you have not ruled over them they have not been called by your name oh that you would rend the heavens and come down that the mountains would tremble before you as when fire sets twigs ablaze and causes water to boil come down to make your name known to your enemies and cause the nations to quake before you for when you did awesome things that we did not expect you came down and the mountains trembled before you since ancient times no one has heard no ear has perceived no eye has seen any god besides you who acts on behalf of those who wait for him you come to the help of those who gladly do right who remember your ways but when we continued to sin against them you were angry how then can we be saved all of us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags we all shrivel up like a leaf and like the wind our sins sweep us away no one calls on your name or strives to lay hold of you for you have hidden your face from us and made us waste away because of our sins yet o lord you are our father we are the clay you are the potter we are all the work of your hand do not be angry beyond measure o lord do not remember our sins forever oh look upon us we pray for we are all your people your sacred cities have become a desert even zion is a desert jerusalem a desolation our holy and glorious temple where our fathers praised you has been burned with fire and all that we treasured lies in ruins after all this o lord will you hold yourself back will you keep silent and punish us beyond measure i revealed myself to those who did not ask for me i was found by those who did not seek me to a nation that did not call on my name i said here am i here am i all day long i have held out my hands to an obstinate people who walk in ways not good pursuing their own imaginations a people who continually provoke me to my very face offering sacrifices in gardens and burning incense on altars of brick who sit among the graves and spend their nights keeping secret vigil who eat the flesh of pigs and whose pots hold broth of unclean meat who say keep away dont come near me for i am too sacred for you such people are smoke in my nostrils a fire that keeps burning all day see it stands written before me i will not keep silent but will pay back in full i will pay it back into their laps both your sins and the sins of your fathers says the lord because they burned sacrifices on the mountains and defied me on the hills i will measure into their laps the full payment for their former deeds this is what the lord says as when juice is still found in a cluster of grapes and men say dont destroy it there is yet some good in it so will i do in behalf of my servants i will not destroy them all i will bring forth descendants from jacob and from judah those who will possess my mountains my chosen people will inherit them and there will my servants live sharon will become a pasture for flocks and the valley of achor a resting place for herds for my people who seek me but as for you who forsake the lord and forget my holy mountain who spread a table for fortune and fill bowls of mixed wine for destiny i will destine you for the sword and you will all bend down for the slaughter for i called but you did not answer i spoke but you did not listen you did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me therefore this is what the sovereign lord says my servants will eat but you will go hungry my servants will drink but you will go thirsty my servants will rejoice but you will be put to shame my servants will sing out of the joy of their hearts but you will cry out from anguish of heart and wail in brokenness of spirit you will leave your name to my chosen ones as a curse the sovereign lord will put you to death but to his servants he will give another name whoever invokes a blessing in the land will do so by the god of truth he who takes an oath in the land will swear by the god of truth for the past troubles will be forgotten and hidden from my eyes behold i will create new heavens and a new earth the former things will not be remembered nor will they come to mind but be glad and rejoice forever in what i will create for i will create jerusalem to be a delight and its people a joy i will rejoice over jerusalem and take delight in my people the sound of weeping and of crying will be heard in it no more never again will there be in it an infant who lives but a few days or an old man who does not live out his years he who dies at a hundred will be thought a mere youth he who fails to reach a hundred will be considered accursed they will build houses and dwell in them they will plant vineyards and eat their fruit no longer will they build houses and others live in them or plant and others eat for as the days of a tree so will be the days of my people my chosen ones will long enjoy the works of their hands they will not toil in vain or bear children doomed to misfortune for they will be a people blessed by the lord they and their descendants with them before they call i will answer while they are still speaking i will hear the wolf and the lamb will feed together and the lion will eat straw like the ox but dust will be the serpents food they will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain says the lord this is what the lord says heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house you will build for me where will my resting place be has not my hand made all these things and so they came into being declares the lord this is the one i esteem he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word but whoever sacrifices a bull is like one who kills a man and whoever offers a lamb like one who breaks a dogs neck whoever makes a grain offering is like one who presents pigs blood and whoever burns memorial incense like one who worships an idol they have chosen their own ways and their souls delight in their abominations so i also will choose harsh treatment for them and will bring upon them what they dread for when i called no one answered when i spoke no one listened they did evil in my sight and chose what displeases me hear the word of the lord you who tremble at his word your brothers who hate you and exclude you because of my name have said let the lord be glorified that we may see your joy yet they will be put to shame hear that uproar from the city hear that noise from the temple it is the sound of the lord repaying his enemies all they deserve before she goes into labor she gives birth before the pains come upon her she delivers a son who has ever heard of such a thing who has ever seen such things can a country be born in a day or a nation be brought forth in a moment yet no sooner is zion in labor than she gives birth to her children do i bring to the moment of birth and not give delivery says the lord do i close up the womb when i bring to delivery says your god rejoice with jerusalem and be glad for her all you who love her rejoice greatly with her all you who mourn over her for you will nurse and be satisfied at her comforting breasts you will drink deeply and delight in her overflowing abundance for this is what the lord says i will extend peace to her like a river and the wealth of nations like a flooding stream you will nurse and be carried on her arm and dandled on her knees as a mother comforts her child so will i comfort you and you will be comforted over jerusalem when you see this your heart will rejoice and you will flourish like grass the hand of the lord will be made known to his servants but his fury will be shown to his foes see the lord is coming with fire and his chariots are like a whirlwind he will bring down his anger with fury and his rebuke with flames of fire for with fire and with his sword the lord will execute judgment upon all men and many will be those slain by the lord those who consecrate and purify themselves to go into the gardens following the one in the midst of those who eat the flesh of pigs and rats and other abominable things they will meet their end together declares the lord and i because of their actions and their imaginations am about to come and gather all nations and tongues and they will come and see my glory i will set a sign among them and i will send some of those who survive to the nations to tarshish to the libyans and lydians famous as archers to tubal and greece and to the distant islands that have not heard of my fame or seen my glory they will proclaim my glory among the nations and they will bring all your brothers from all the nations to my holy mountain in jerusalem as an offering to the lord on horses in chariots and wagons and on mules and camels says the lord they will bring them as the israelites bring their grain offerings to the temple of the lord in ceremonially clean vessels and i will select some of them also to be priests and levites says the lord as the new heavens and the new earth that i make will endure before me declares the lord so will your name and descendants endure from one new moon to another and from one sabbath to another all mankind will come and bow down before me says the lord and they will go out and look upon the dead bodies of those who rebelled against me their worm will not die nor will their fire be quenched and they will be loathsome to all mankind  the words of jeremiah son of hilkiah one of the priests at anathoth in the territory of benjamin the word of the lord came to him in the thirteenth year of the reign of josiah son of amon king of judah and through the reign of jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah down to the fifth month of the eleventh year of zedekiah son of josiah king of judah when the people of jerusalem went into exile the word of the lord came to me saying before i formed you in the womb i knew you before you were born i set you apart i appointed you as a prophet to the nations ah sovereign lord i said i do not know how to speak i am only a child but the lord said to me do not say i am only a child you must go to everyone i send you to and say whatever i command you do not be afraid of them for i am with you and will rescue you declares the lord then the lord reached out his hand and touched my mouth and said to me now i have put my words in your mouth see today i appoint you over nations and kingdoms to uproot and tear down to destroy and overthrow to build and to plant the word of the lord came to me what do you see jeremiahi see the branch of an almond tree i replied the lord said to me you have seen correctly for i am watching to see that my word is fulfilled the word of the lord came to me again what do you seei see a boiling pot tilting away from the north i answered the lord said to me from the north disaster will be poured out on all who live in the land i am about to summon all the peoples of the northern kingdoms declares the lord their kings will come and set up their thrones in the entrance of the gates of jerusalem they will come against all her surrounding walls and against all the towns of judah i will pronounce my judgments on my people because of their wickedness in forsaking me in burning incense to other gods and in worshiping what their hands have made get yourself ready stand up and say to them whatever i command you do not be terrified by them or i will terrify you before them today i have made you a fortified city an iron pillar and a bronze wall to stand against the whole land against the kings of judah its officials its priests and the people of the land they will fight against you but will not overcome you for i am with you and will rescue you declares the lord the word of the lord came to me go and proclaim in the hearing of jerusalem i remember the devotion of your youth how as a bride you loved me and followed me through the desert through a land not sown israel was holy to the lord the firstfruits of his harvest all who devoured her were held guilty and disaster overtook them declares the lord hear the word of the lord o house of jacob all you clans of the house of israel this is what the lord says what fault did your fathers find in me that they strayed so far from me they followed worthless idols and became worthless themselves they did not ask where is the lord who brought us up out of egypt and led us through the barren wilderness through a land of deserts and rifts a land of drought and darkness a land where no one travels and no one lives i brought you into a fertile land to eat its fruit and rich produce but you came and defiled my land and made my inheritance detestable the priests did not ask where is the lord those who deal with the law did not know me the leaders rebelled against me the prophets prophesied by baal following worthless idols therefore i bring charges against you again declares the lord and i will bring charges against your childrens children cross over to the coasts of kittim and look send to kedar and observe closely see if there has ever been anything like this has a nation ever changed its gods yet they are not gods at all but my people have exchanged their glory for worthless idols be appalled at this o heavens and shudder with great horror declares the lord my people have committed two sins they have forsaken me the spring of living water and have dug their own cisterns broken cisterns that cannot hold water is israel a servant a slave by birth why then has he become plunder lions have roared they have growled at him they have laid waste his land his towns are burned and deserted also the men of memphis and tahpanhes have shaved the crown of your head have you not brought this on yourselves by forsaking the lord your god when he led you in the way now why go to egypt to drink water from the shihor and why go to assyria to drink water from the river your wickedness will punish you your backsliding will rebuke you consider then and realize how evil and bitter it is for you when you forsake the lord your god and have no awe of me declares the lord the lord almighty long ago you broke off your yoke and tore off your bonds you said i will not serve you indeed on every high hill and under every spreading tree you lay down as a prostitute i had planted you like a choice vine of sound and reliable stock how then did you turn against me into a corrupt wild vine although you wash yourself with soda and use an abundance of soap the stain of your guilt is still before me declares the sovereign lord how can you say i am not defiled i have not run after the baals see how you behaved in the valley consider what you have done you are a swift she camel running here and there a wild donkey accustomed to the desert sniffing the wind in her craving in her heat who can restrain her any males that pursue her need not tire themselves at mating time they will find her do not run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry but you said its no use i love foreign gods and i must go after them as a thief is disgraced when he is caught so the house of israel is disgraced they their kings and their officials their priests and their prophets they say to wood you are my father and to stone you gave me birth they have turned their backs to me and not their faces yet when they are in trouble they say come and save us where then are the gods you made for yourselves let them come if they can save you when you are in trouble for you have as many gods as you have towns o judah why do you bring charges against me you have all rebelled against me declares the lord in vain i punished your people they did not respond to correction your sword has devoured your prophets like a ravening lion you of this generation consider the word of the lord have i been a desert to israel or a land of great darkness why do my people say we are free to roam we will come to you no more does a maiden forget her jewelry a bride her wedding ornaments yet my people have forgotten me days without number how skilled you are at pursuing love even the worst of women can learn from your ways on your clothes men find the lifeblood of the innocent poor though you did not catch them breaking in yet in spite of all this you say i am innocent he is not angry with me but i will pass judgment on you because you say i have not sinned why do you go about so much changing your ways you will be disappointed by egypt as you were by assyria you will also leave that place with your hands on your head for the lord has rejected those you trust you will not be helped by them if a man divorces his wife and she leaves him and marries another man should he return to her again would not the land be completely defiled but you have lived as a prostitute with many lovers would you now return to me declares the lord look up to the barren heights and see is there any place where you have not been ravished by the roadside you sat waiting for lovers sat like a nomad in the desert you have defiled the land with your prostitution and wickedness therefore the showers have been withheld and no spring rains have fallen yet you have the brazen look of a prostitute you refuse to blush with shame have you not just called to me my father my friend from my youth will you always be angry will your wrath continue forever this is how you talk but you do all the evil you can during the reign of king josiah the lord said to me have you seen what faithless israel has done she has gone up on every high hill and under every spreading tree and has committed adultery there i thought that after she had done all this she would return to me but she did not and her unfaithful sister judah saw it i gave faithless israel her certificate of divorce and sent her away because of all her adulteries yet i saw that her unfaithful sister judah had no fear she also went out and committed adultery because israels immorality mattered so little to her she defiled the land and committed adultery with stone and wood in spite of all this her unfaithful sister judah did not return to me with all her heart but only in pretense declares the lord the lord said to me faithless israel is more righteous than unfaithful judah go proclaim this message toward the north return faithless israel declares the lord i will frown on you no longer for i am merciful declares the lord i will not be angry forever only acknowledge your guilt you have rebelled against the lord your god you have scattered your favors to foreign gods under every spreading tree and have not obeyed me declares the lord return faithless people declares the lord for i am your husband i will choose you one from a town and two from a clan and bring you to zion then i will give you shepherds after my own heart who will lead you with knowledge and understanding in those days when your numbers have increased greatly in the land declares the lord men will no longer say the ark of the covenant of the lord it will never enter their minds or be remembered it will not be missed nor will another one be made at that time they will call jerusalem the throne of the lord and all nations will gather in jerusalem to honor the name of the lord no longer will they follow the stubbornness of their evil hearts in those days the house of judah will join the house of israel and together they will come from a northern land to the land i gave your forefathers as an inheritance i myself said how gladly would i treat you like sons and give you a desirable land the most beautiful inheritance of any nation i thought you would call me father and not turn away from following me but like a woman unfaithful to her husband so you have been unfaithful to me o house of israel declares the lord a cry is heard on the barren heights the weeping and pleading of the people of israel because they have perverted their ways and have forgotten the lord their god return faithless people i will cure you of backslidingyes we will come to you for you are the lord our god surely the idolatrous commotion on the hills and mountains is a deception surely in the lord our god is the salvation of israel from our youth shameful gods have consumed the fruits of our fathers labor their flocks and herds their sons and daughters let us lie down in our shame and let our disgrace cover us we have sinned against the lord our god both we and our fathers from our youth till this day we have not obeyed the lord our god if you will return o israel return to me declares the lord if you put your detestable idols out of my sight and no longer go astray and if in a truthful just and righteous way you swear as surely as the lord lives then the nations will be blessed by him and in him they will glory this is what the lord says to the men of judah and to jerusalem break up your unplowed ground and do not sow among thorns circumcise yourselves to the lord circumcise your hearts you men of judah and people of jerusalem or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done burn with no one to quench it announce in judah and proclaim in jerusalem and say sound the trumpet throughout the land cry aloud and say gather together let us flee to the fortified cities raise the signal to go to zion flee for safety without delay for i am bringing disaster from the north even terrible destruction a lion has come out of his lair a destroyer of nations has set out he has left his place to lay waste your land your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant so put on sackcloth lament and wail for the fierce anger of the lord has not turned away from us in that day declares the lord the king and the officials will lose heart the priests will be horrified and the prophets will be appalled then i said ah sovereign lord how completely you have deceived this people and jerusalem by saying you will have peace when the sword is at our throats at that time this people and jerusalem will be told a scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert blows toward my people but not to winnow or cleanse a wind too strong for that comes from me now i pronounce my judgments against them look he advances like the clouds his chariots come like a whirlwind his horses are swifter than eagles woe to us we are ruined o jerusalem wash the evil from your heart and be saved how long will you harbor wicked thoughts a voice is announcing from dan proclaiming disaster from the hills of ephraim tell this to the nations proclaim it to jerusalem a besieging army is coming from a distant land raising a war cry against the cities of judah they surround her like men guarding a field because she has rebelled against me declares the lord your own conduct and actions have brought this upon you this is your punishment how bitter it is how it pierces to the heart oh my anguish my anguish i writhe in pain oh the agony of my heart my heart pounds within me i cannot keep silent for i have heard the sound of the trumpet i have heard the battle cry disaster follows disaster the whole land lies in ruins in an instant my tents are destroyed my shelter in a moment how long must i see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet my people are fools they do not know me they are senseless children they have no understanding they are skilled in doing evil they know not how to do good i looked at the earth and it was formless and empty and at the heavens and their light was gone i looked at the mountains and they were quaking all the hills were swaying i looked and there were no people every bird in the sky had flown away i looked and the fruitful land was a desert all its towns lay in ruins before the lord before his fierce anger this is what the lord says the whole land will be ruined though i will not destroy it completely therefore the earth will mourn and the heavens above grow dark because i have spoken and will not relent i have decided and will not turn back at the sound of horsemen and archers every town takes to flight some go into the thickets some climb up among the rocks all the towns are deserted no one lives in them what are you doing o devastated one why dress yourself in scarlet and put on jewels of gold why shade your eyes with paint you adorn yourself in vain your lovers despise you they seek your life i hear a cry as of a woman in labor a groan as of one bearing her first child the cry of the daughter of zion gasping for breath stretching out her hands and saying alas i am fainting my life is given over to murderers go up and down the streets of jerusalem look around and consider search through her squares if you can find but one person who deals honestly and seeks the truth i will forgive this city although they say as surely as the lord lives still they are swearing falsely o lord do not your eyes look for truth you struck them but they felt no pain you crushed them but they refused correction they made their faces harder than stone and refused to repent i thought these are only the poor they are foolish for they do not know the way of the lord the requirements of their god so i will go to the leaders and speak to them surely they know the way of the lord the requirements of their god but with one accord they too had broken off the yoke and torn off the bonds therefore a lion from the forest will attack them a wolf from the desert will ravage them a leopard will lie in wait near their towns to tear to pieces any who venture out for their rebellion is great and their backslidings many why should i forgive you your children have forsaken me and sworn by gods that are not gods i supplied all their needs yet they committed adultery and thronged to the houses of prostitutes they are well fed lusty stallions each neighing for another mans wife should i not punish them for this declares the lord should i not avenge myself on such a nation as this go through her vineyards and ravage them but do not destroy them completely strip off her branches for these people do not belong to the lord the house of israel and the house of judah have been utterly unfaithful to me declares the lord they have lied about the lord they said he will do nothing no harm will come to us we will never see sword or famine the prophets are but wind and the word is not in them so let what they say be done to them therefore this is what the lord god almighty says because the people have spoken these words i will make my words in your mouth a fire and these people the wood it consumes o house of israel declares the lord i am bringing a distant nation against you an ancient and enduring nation a people whose language you do not know whose speech you do not understand their quivers are like an open grave all of them are mighty warriors they will devour your harvests and food devour your sons and daughters they will devour your flocks and herds devour your vines and fig trees with the sword they will destroy the fortified cities in which you trust yet even in those days declares the lord i will not destroy you completely and when the people ask why has the lord our god done all this to us you will tell them as you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your own land so now you will serve foreigners in a land not your own announce this to the house of jacob and proclaim it in judah hear this you foolish and senseless people who have eyes but do not see who have ears but do not hear should you not fear me declares the lord should you not tremble in my presence i made the sand a boundary for the sea an everlasting barrier it cannot cross the waves may roll but they cannot prevail they may roar but they cannot cross it but these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts they have turned aside and gone away they do not say to themselves let us fear the lord our god who gives autumn and spring rains in season who assures us of the regular weeks of harvest your wrongdoings have kept these away your sins have deprived you of good among my people are wicked men who lie in wait like men who snare birds and like those who set traps to catch men like cages full of birds their houses are full of deceit they have become rich and powerful and have grown fat and sleek their evil deeds have no limit they do not plead the case of the fatherless to win it they do not defend the rights of the poor should i not punish them for this declares the lord should i not avenge myself on such a nation as this a horrible and shocking thing has happened in the land the prophets prophesy lies the priests rule by their own authority and my people love it this way but what will you do in the end flee for safety people of benjamin flee from jerusalem sound the trumpet in tekoa raise the signal over beth hakkerem for disaster looms out of the north even terrible destruction i will destroy the daughter of zion so beautiful and delicate shepherds with their flocks will come against her they will pitch their tents around her each tending his own portion prepare for battle against her arise let us attack at noon but alas the daylight is fading and the shadows of evening grow long so arise let us attack at night and destroy her fortresses this is what the lord almighty says cut down the trees and build siege ramps against jerusalem this city must be punished it is filled with oppression as a well pours out its water so she pours out her wickedness violence and destruction resound in her her sickness and wounds are ever before me take warning o jerusalem or i will turn away from you and make your land desolate so no one can live in it this is what the lord almighty says let them glean the remnant of israel as thoroughly as a vine pass your hand over the branches again like one gathering grapes to whom can i speak and give warning who will listen to me their ears are closed so they cannot hear the word of the lord is offensive to them they find no pleasure in it but i am full of the wrath of the lord and i cannot hold it in pour it out on the children in the street and on the young men gathered together both husband and wife will be caught in it and the old those weighed down with years their houses will be turned over to others together with their fields and their wives when i stretch out my hand against those who live in the land declares the lord from the least to the greatest all are greedy for gain prophets and priests alike all practice deceit they dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious peace peace they say when there is no peace are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct no they have no shame at all they do not even know how to blush so they will fall among the fallen they will be brought down when i punish them says the lord this is what the lord says stand at the crossroads and look ask for the ancient paths ask where the good way is and walk in it and you will find rest for your souls but you said we will not walk in it i appointed watchmen over you and said listen to the sound of the trumpet but you said we will not listen therefore hear o nations observe o witnesses what will happen to them hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words and have rejected my law what do i care about incense from sheba or sweet calamus from a distant land your burnt offerings are not acceptable your sacrifices do not please me therefore this is what the lord says i will put obstacles before this people fathers and sons alike will stumble over them neighbors and friends will perish this is what the lord says look an army is coming from the land of the north a great nation is being stirred up from the ends of the earth they are armed with bow and spear they are cruel and show no mercy they sound like the roaring sea as they ride on their horses they come like men in battle formation to attack you o daughter of zion we have heard reports about them and our hands hang limp anguish has gripped us pain like that of a woman in labor do not go out to the fields or walk on the roads for the enemy has a sword and there is terror on every side o my people put on sackcloth and roll in ashes mourn with bitter wailing as for an only son for suddenly the destroyer will come upon us i have made you a tester of metals and my people the ore that you may observe and test their ways they are all hardened rebels going about to slander they are bronze and iron they all act corruptly the bellows blow fiercely to burn away the lead with fire but the refining goes on in vain the wicked are not purged out they are called rejected silver because the lord has rejected them this is the word that came to jeremiah from the lord stand at the gate of the lords house and there proclaim this message hear the word of the lord all you people of judah who come through these gates to worship the lord this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says reform your ways and your actions and i will let you live in this place do not trust in deceptive words and say this is the temple of the lord the temple of the lord the temple of the lord if you really change your ways and your actions and deal with each other justly if you do not oppress the alien the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place and if you do not follow other gods to your own harm then i will let you live in this place in the land i gave your forefathers for ever and ever but look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless will you steal and murder commit adultery and perjury burn incense to baal and follow other gods you have not known and then come and stand before me in this house which bears my name and say we are safe safe to do all these detestable things has this house which bears my name become a den of robbers to you but i have been watching declares the lord go now to the place in shiloh where i first made a dwelling for my name and see what i did to it because of the wickedness of my people israel while you were doing all these things declares the lord i spoke to you again and again but you did not listen i called you but you did not answer therefore what i did to shiloh i will now do to the house that bears my name the temple you trust in the place i gave to you and your fathers i will thrust you from my presence just as i did all your brothers the people of ephraim so do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them do not plead with me for i will not listen to you do you not see what they are doing in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem the children gather wood the fathers light the fire and the women knead the dough and make cakes of bread for the queen of heaven they pour out drink offerings to other gods to provoke me to anger but am i the one they are provoking declares the lord are they not rather harming themselves to their own shame therefore this is what the sovereign lord says my anger and my wrath will be poured out on this place on man and beast on the trees of the field and on the fruit of the ground and it will burn and not be quenched this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says go ahead add your burnt offerings to your other sacrifices and eat the meat yourselves for when i brought your forefathers out of egypt and spoke to them i did not just give them commands about burnt offerings and sacrifices but i gave them this command obey me and i will be your god and you will be my people walk in all the ways i command you that it may go well with you but they did not listen or pay attention instead they followed the stubborn inclinations of their evil hearts they went backward and not forward from the time your forefathers left egypt until now day after day again and again i sent you my servants the prophets but they did not listen to me or pay attention they were stiff necked and did more evil than their forefathers when you tell them all this they will not listen to you when you call to them they will not answer therefore say to them this is the nation that has not obeyed the lord its god or responded to correction truth has perished it has vanished from their lips cut off your hair and throw it away take up a lament on the barren heights for the lord has rejected and abandoned this generation that is under his wrath the people of judah have done evil in my eyes declares the lord they have set up their detestable idols in the house that bears my name and have defiled it they have built the high places of topheth in the valley of ben hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire something i did not command nor did it enter my mind so beware the days are coming declares the lord when people will no longer call it topheth or the valley of ben hinnom but the valley of slaughter for they will bury the dead in topheth until there is no more room then the carcasses of this people will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth and there will be no one to frighten them away i will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in the towns of judah and the streets of jerusalem for the land will become desolate at that time declares the lord the bones of the kings and officials of judah the bones of the priests and prophets and the bones of the people of jerusalem will be removed from their graves they will be exposed to the sun and the moon and all the stars of the heavens which they have loved and served and which they have followed and consulted and worshiped they will not be gathered up or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground wherever i banish them all the survivors of this evil nation will prefer death to life declares the lord almighty say to them this is what the lord says when men fall down do they not get up when a man turns away does he not return why then have these people turned away why does jerusalem always turn away they cling to deceit they refuse to return i have listened attentively but they do not say what is right no one repents of his wickedness saying what have i done each pursues his own course like a horse charging into battle even the stork in the sky knows her appointed seasons and the dove the swift and the thrush observe the time of their migration but my people do not know the requirements of the lord how can you say we are wise for we have the law of the lord when actually the lying pen of the scribes has handled it falsely the wise will be put to shame they will be dismayed and trapped since they have rejected the word of the lord what kind of wisdom do they have therefore i will give their wives to other men and their fields to new owners from the least to the greatest all are greedy for gain prophets and priests alike all practice deceit they dress the wound of my people as though it were not serious peace peace they say when there is no peace are they ashamed of their loathsome conduct no they have no shame at all they do not even know how to blush so they will fall among the fallen they will be brought down when they are punished says the lord i will take away their harvest declares the lord there will be no grapes on the vine there will be no figs on the tree and their leaves will wither what i have given them will be taken from them why are we sitting here gather together let us flee to the fortified cities and perish there for the lord our god has doomed us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink because we have sinned against him we hoped for peace but no good has come for a time of healing but there was only terror the snorting of the enemys horses is heard from dan at the neighing of their stallions the whole land trembles they have come to devour the land and everything in it the city and all who live there see i will send venomous snakes among you vipers that cannot be charmed and they will bite you declares the lord o my comforter in sorrow my heart is faint within me listen to the cry of my people from a land far away is the lord not in zion is her king no longer therewhy have they provoked me to anger with their images with their worthless foreign idols the harvest is past the summer has ended and we are not saved since my people are crushed i am crushed i mourn and horror grips me is there no balm in gilead is there no physician there why then is there no healing for the wound of my people oh that my head were a spring of water and my eyes a fountain of tears i would weep day and night for the slain of my people oh that i had in the desert a lodging place for travelers so that i might leave my people and go away from them for they are all adulterers a crowd of unfaithful people they make ready their tongue like a bow to shoot lies it is not by truth that they triumph in the land they go from one sin to another they do not acknowledge me declares the lord beware of your friends do not trust your brothers for every brother is a deceiver and every friend a slanderer friend deceives friend and no one speaks the truth they have taught their tongues to lie they weary themselves with sinning you live in the midst of deception in their deceit they refuse to acknowledge me declares the lord therefore this is what the lord almighty says see i will refine and test them for what else can i do because of the sin of my people their tongue is a deadly arrow it speaks with deceit with his mouth each speaks cordially to his neighbor but in his heart he sets a trap for him should i not punish them for this declares the lord should i not avenge myself on such a nation as this i will weep and wail for the mountains and take up a lament concerning the desert pastures they are desolate and untraveled and the lowing of cattle is not heard the birds of the air have fled and the animals are gone i will make jerusalem a heap of ruins a haunt of jackals and i will lay waste the towns of judah so no one can live there what man is wise enough to understand this who has been instructed by the lord and can explain it why has the land been ruined and laid waste like a desert that no one can cross the lord said it is because they have forsaken my law which i set before them they have not obeyed me or followed my law instead they have followed the stubbornness of their hearts they have followed the baals as their fathers taught them therefore this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says see i will make this people eat bitter food and drink poisoned water i will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their fathers have known and i will pursue them with the sword until i have destroyed them this is what the lord almighty says consider now call for the wailing women to come send for the most skillful of them let them come quickly and wail over us till our eyes overflow with tears and water streams from our eyelids the sound of wailing is heard from zion how ruined we are how great is our shame we must leave our land because our houses are in ruins now o women hear the word of the lord open your ears to the words of his mouth teach your daughters how to wail teach one another a lament death has climbed in through our windows and has entered our fortresses it has cut off the children from the streets and the young men from the public squares say this is what the lord declares the dead bodies of men will lie like refuse on the open field like cut grain behind the reaper with no one to gather them this is what the lord says let not the wise man boast of his wisdom or the strong man boast of his strength or the rich man boast of his riches but let him who boasts boast about this that he understands and knows me that i am the lord who exercises kindness justice and righteousness on earth for in these i delight declares the lord the days are coming declares the lord when i will punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh egypt judah edom ammon moab and all who live in the desert in distant places for all these nations are really uncircumcised and even the whole house of israel is uncircumcised in heart hear what the lord says to you o house of israel this is what the lord says do not learn the ways of the nations or be terrified by signs in the sky though the nations are terrified by them for the customs of the peoples are worthless they cut a tree out of the forest and a craftsman shapes it with his chisel they adorn it with silver and gold they fasten it with hammer and nails so it will not totter like a scarecrow in a melon patch their idols cannot speak they must be carried because they cannot walk do not fear them they can do no harm nor can they do any good no one is like you o lord you are great and your name is mighty in power who should not revere you o king of the nations this is your due among all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms there is no one like you they are all senseless and foolish they are taught by worthless wooden idols hammered silver is brought from tarshish and gold from uphaz what the craftsman and goldsmith have made is then dressed in blue and purple all made by skilled workers but the lord is the true god he is the living god the eternal king when he is angry the earth trembles the nations cannot endure his wrath tell them this these gods who did not make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from under the heavens but god made the earth by his power he founded the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding when he thunders the waters in the heavens roar he makes clouds rise from the ends of the earth he sends lightning with the rain and brings out the wind from his storehouses everyone is senseless and without knowledge every goldsmith is shamed by his idols his images are a fraud they have no breath in them they are worthless the objects of mockery when their judgment comes they will perish he who is the portion of jacob is not like these for he is the maker of all things including israel the tribe of his inheritance the lord almighty is his name gather up your belongings to leave the land you who live under siege for this is what the lord says at this time i will hurl out those who live in this land i will bring distress on them so that they may be captured woe to me because of my injury my wound is incurable yet i said to myself this is my sickness and i must endure it my tent is destroyed all its ropes are snapped my sons are gone from me and are no more no one is left now to pitch my tent or to set up my shelter the shepherds are senseless and do not inquire of the lord so they do not prosper and all their flock is scattered listen the report is coming a great commotion from the land of the north it will make the towns of judah desolate a haunt of jackals i know o lord that a mans life is not his own it is not for man to direct his steps correct me lord but only with justice not in your anger lest you reduce me to nothing pour out your wrath on the nations that do not acknowledge you on the peoples who do not call on your name for they have devoured jacob they have devoured him completely and destroyed his homeland this is the word that came to jeremiah from the lord listen to the terms of this covenant and tell them to the people of judah and to those who live in jerusalem tell them that this is what the lord the god of israel says cursed is the man who does not obey the terms of this covenant the terms i commanded your forefathers when i brought them out of egypt out of the iron smelting furnace i said obey me and do everything i command you and you will be my people and i will be your god then i will fulfill the oath i swore to your forefathers to give them a land flowing with milk and honey the land you possess today i answered amen lord the lord said to me proclaim all these words in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem listen to the terms of this covenant and follow them from the time i brought your forefathers up from egypt until today i warned them again and again saying obey me but they did not listen or pay attention instead they followed the stubbornness of their evil hearts so i brought on them all the curses of the covenant i had commanded them to follow but that they did not keep then the lord said to me there is a conspiracy among the people of judah and those who live in jerusalem they have returned to the sins of their forefathers who refused to listen to my words they have followed other gods to serve them both the house of israel and the house of judah have broken the covenant i made with their forefathers therefore this is what the lord says i will bring on them a disaster they cannot escape although they cry out to me i will not listen to them the towns of judah and the people of jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense but they will not help them at all when disaster strikes you have as many gods as you have towns o judah and the altars you have set up to burn incense to that shameful god baal are as many as the streets of jerusalem do not pray for this people nor offer any plea or petition for them because i will not listen when they call to me in the time of their distress what is my beloved doing in my temple as she works out her evil schemes with many can consecrated meat avert your punishment when you engage in your wickedness then you rejoice the lord called you a thriving olive tree with fruit beautiful in form but with the roar of a mighty storm he will set it on fire and its branches will be broken the lord almighty who planted you has decreed disaster for you because the house of israel and the house of judah have done evil and provoked me to anger by burning incense to baal because the lord revealed their plot to me i knew it for at that time he showed me what they were doing i had been like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter i did not realize that they had plotted against me saying let us destroy the tree and its fruit let us cut him off from the land of the living that his name be remembered no more but o lord almighty you who judge righteously and test the heart and mind let me see your vengeance upon them for to you i have committed my cause therefore this is what the lord says about the men of anathoth who are seeking your life and saying do not prophesy in the name of the lord or you will die by our hands therefore this is what the lord almighty says i will punish them their young men will die by the sword their sons and daughters by famine not even a remnant will be left to them because i will bring disaster on the men of anathoth in the year of their punishment you are always righteous o lord when i bring a case before you yet i would speak with you about your justice why does the way of the wicked prosper why do all the faithless live at ease you have planted them and they have taken root they grow and bear fruit you are always on their lips but far from their hearts yet you know me o lord you see me and test my thoughts about you drag them off like sheep to be butchered set them apart for the day of slaughter how long will the land lie parched and the grass in every field be withered because those who live in it are wicked the animals and birds have perished moreover the people are saying he will not see what happens to us if you have raced with men on foot and they have worn you out how can you compete with horses if you stumble in safe country how will you manage in the thickets by the jordan your brothers your own family even they have betrayed you they have raised a loud cry against you do not trust them though they speak well of you i will forsake my house abandon my inheritance i will give the one i love into the hands of her enemies my inheritance has become to me like a lion in the forest she roars at me therefore i hate her has not my inheritance become to me like a speckled bird of prey that other birds of prey surround and attack go and gather all the wild beasts bring them to devour many shepherds will ruin my vineyard and trample down my field they will turn my pleasant field into a desolate wasteland it will be made a wasteland parched and desolate before me the whole land will be laid waste because there is no one who cares over all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will swarm for the sword of the lord will devour from one end of the land to the other no one will be safe they will sow wheat but reap thorns they will wear themselves out but gain nothing so bear the shame of your harvest because of the lords fierce anger this is what the lord says as for all my wicked neighbors who seize the inheritance i gave my people israel i will uproot them from their lands and i will uproot the house of judah from among them but after i uproot them i will again have compassion and will bring each of them back to his own inheritance and his own country and if they learn well the ways of my people and swear by my name saying as surely as the lord lives even as they once taught my people to swear by baal then they will be established among my people but if any nation does not listen i will completely uproot and destroy it declares the lord this is what the lord said to me go and buy a linen belt and put it around your waist but do not let it touch water so i bought a belt as the lord directed and put it around my waist then the word of the lord came to me a second time take the belt you bought and are wearing around your waist and go now to perath and hide it there in a crevice in the rocks so i went and hid it at perath as the lord told me many days later the lord said to me go now to perath and get the belt i told you to hide there so i went to perath and dug up the belt and took it from the place where i had hidden it but now it was ruined and completely useless then the word of the lord came to me this is what the lord says in the same way i will ruin the pride of judah and the great pride of jerusalem these wicked people who refuse to listen to my words who follow the stubbornness of their hearts and go after other gods to serve and worship them will be like this belt completely useless for as a belt is bound around a mans waist so i bound the whole house of israel and the whole house of judah to me declares the lord to be my people for my renown and praise and honor but they have not listened say to them this is what the lord the god of israel says every wineskin should be filled with wine and if they say to you dont we know that every wineskin should be filled with wine then tell them this is what the lord says i am going to fill with drunkenness all who live in this land including the kings who sit on davids throne the priests the prophets and all those living in jerusalem i will smash them one against the other fathers and sons alike declares the lord i will allow no pity or mercy or compassion to keep me from destroying them hear and pay attention do not be arrogant for the lord has spoken give glory to the lord your god before he brings the darkness before your feet stumble on the darkening hills you hope for light but he will turn it to thick darkness and change it to deep gloom but if you do not listen i will weep in secret because of your pride my eyes will weep bitterly overflowing with tears because the lords flock will be taken captive say to the king and to the queen mother come down from your thrones for your glorious crowns will fall from your heads the cities in the negev will be shut up and there will be no one to open them all judah will be carried into exile carried completely away lift up your eyes and see those who are coming from the north where is the flock that was entrusted to you the sheep of which you boasted what will you say when the lord sets over you those you cultivated as your special allies will not pain grip you like that of a woman in labor and if you ask yourself why has this happened to me it is because of your many sins that your skirts have been torn off and your body mistreated can the ethiopian change his skin or the leopard its spots neither can you do good who are accustomed to doing evil i will scatter you like chaff driven by the desert wind this is your lot the portion i have decreed for you declares the lord because you have forgotten me and trusted in false gods i will pull up your skirts over your face that your shame may be seen your adulteries and lustful neighings your shameless prostitution i have seen your detestable acts on the hills and in the fields woe to you o jerusalem how long will you be unclean this is the word of the lord to jeremiah concerning the drought judah mourns her cities languish they wail for the land and a cry goes up from jerusalem the nobles send their servants for water they go to the cisterns but find no water they return with their jars unfilled dismayed and despairing they cover their heads the ground is cracked because there is no rain in the land the farmers are dismayed and cover their heads even the doe in the field deserts her newborn fawn because there is no grass wild donkeys stand on the barren heights and pant like jackals their eyesight fails for lack of pasture although our sins testify against us o lord do something for the sake of your name for our backsliding is great we have sinned against you o hope of israel its savior in times of distress why are you like a stranger in the land like a traveler who stays only a night why are you like a man taken by surprise like a warrior powerless to save you are among us o lord and we bear your name do not forsake us this is what the lord says about this people they greatly love to wander they do not restrain their feet so the lord does not accept them he will now remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins then the lord said to me do not pray for the well being of this people although they fast i will not listen to their cry though they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings i will not accept them instead i will destroy them with the sword famine and plague but i said ah sovereign lord the prophets keep telling them you will not see the sword or suffer famine indeed i will give you lasting peace in this place then the lord said to me the prophets are prophesying lies in my name i have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them they are prophesying to you false visions divinations idolatries and the delusions of their own minds therefore this is what the lord says about the prophets who are prophesying in my name i did not send them yet they are saying no sword or famine will touch this land those same prophets will perish by sword and famine and the people they are prophesying to will be thrown out into the streets of jerusalem because of the famine and sword there will be no one to bury them or their wives their sons or their daughters i will pour out on them the calamity they deserve speak this word to them let my eyes overflow with tears night and day without ceasing for my virgin daughter my people has suffered a grievous wound a crushing blow if i go into the country i see those slain by the sword if i go into the city i see the ravages of famine both prophet and priest have gone to a land they know not have you rejected judah completely do you despise zion why have you afflicted us so that we cannot be healed we hoped for peace but no good has come for a time of healing but there is only terror o lord we acknowledge our wickedness and the guilt of our fathers we have indeed sinned against you for the sake of your name do not despise us do not dishonor your glorious throne remember your covenant with us and do not break it do any of the worthless idols of the nations bring rain do the skies themselves send down showers no it is you o lord our god therefore our hope is in you for you are the one who does all this then the lord said to me even if moses and samuel were to stand before me my heart would not go out to this people send them away from my presence let them go and if they ask you where shall we go tell them this is what the lord says those destined for death to death those for the sword to the sword those for starvation to starvation those for captivity to captivity i will send four kinds of destroyers against them declares the lord the sword to kill and the dogs to drag away and the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth to devour and destroy i will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what manasseh son of hezekiah king of judah did in jerusalem who will have pity on you o jerusalem who will mourn for you who will stop to ask how you are you have rejected me declares the lord you keep on backsliding so i will lay hands on you and destroy you i can no longer show compassion i will winnow them with a winnowing fork at the city gates of the land i will bring bereavement and destruction on my people for they have not changed their ways i will make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea at midday i will bring a destroyer against the mothers of their young men suddenly i will bring down on them anguish and terror the mother of seven will grow faint and breathe her last her sun will set while it is still day she will be disgraced and humiliated i will put the survivors to the sword before their enemies declares the lord alas my mother that you gave me birth a man with whom the whole land strives and contends i have neither lent nor borrowed yet everyone curses me the lord said surely i will deliver you for a good purpose surely i will make your enemies plead with you in times of disaster and times of distress can a man break iron iron from the north or bronze your wealth and your treasures i will give as plunder without charge because of all your sins throughout your country i will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know for my anger will kindle a fire that will burn against you you understand o lord remember me and care for me avenge me on my persecutors you are long suffering do not take me away think of how i suffer reproach for your sake when your words came i ate them they were my joy and my hearts delight for i bear your name o lord god almighty i never sat in the company of revelers never made merry with them i sat alone because your hand was on me and you had filled me with indignation why is my pain unending and my wound grievous and incurable will you be to me like a deceptive brook like a spring that fails therefore this is what the lord says if you repent i will restore you that you may serve me if you utter worthy not worthless words you will be my spokesman let this people turn to you but you must not turn to them i will make you a wall to this people a fortified wall of bronze they will fight against you but will not overcome you for i am with you to rescue and save you declares the lord i will save you from the hands of the wicked and redeem you from the grasp of the cruel then the word of the lord came to me you must not marry and have sons or daughters in this place for this is what the lord says about the sons and daughters born in this land and about the women who are their mothers and the men who are their fathers they will die of deadly diseases they will not be mourned or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground they will perish by sword and famine and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth for this is what the lord says do not enter a house where there is a funeral meal do not go to mourn or show sympathy because i have withdrawn my blessing my love and my pity from this people declares the lord both high and low will die in this land they will not be buried or mourned and no one will cut himself or shave his head for them no one will offer food to comfort those who mourn for the dead not even for a father or a mother nor will anyone give them a drink to console them and do not enter a house where there is feasting and sit down to eat and drink for this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says before your eyes and in your days i will bring an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the voices of bride and bridegroom in this place when you tell these people all this and they ask you why has the lord decreed such a great disaster against us what wrong have we done what sin have we committed against the lord our god then say to them it is because your fathers forsook me declares the lord and followed other gods and served and worshiped them they forsook me and did not keep my law but you have behaved more wickedly than your fathers see how each of you is following the stubbornness of his evil heart instead of obeying me so i will throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your fathers have known and there you will serve other gods day and night for i will show you no favor however the days are coming declares the lord when men will no longer say as surely as the lord lives who brought the israelites up out of egypt but they will say as surely as the lord lives who brought the israelites up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them for i will restore them to the land i gave their forefathers but now i will send for many fishermen declares the lord and they will catch them after that i will send for many hunters and they will hunt them down on every mountain and hill and from the crevices of the rocks my eyes are on all their ways they are not hidden from me nor is their sin concealed from my eyes i will repay them double for their wickedness and their sin because they have defiled my land with the lifeless forms of their vile images and have filled my inheritance with their detestable idols o lord my strength and my fortress my refuge in time of distress to you the nations will come from the ends of the earth and say our fathers possessed nothing but false gods worthless idols that did them no good do men make their own gods yes but they are not gods therefore i will teach them this time i will teach them my power and might then they will know that my name is the lord judahs sin is engraved with an iron tool inscribed with a flint point on the tablets of their hearts and on the horns of their altars even their children remember their altars and asherah poles beside the spreading trees and on the high hills my mountain in the land and your wealth and all your treasures i will give away as plunder together with your high places because of sin throughout your country through your own fault you will lose the inheritance i gave you i will enslave you to your enemies in a land you do not know for you have kindled my anger and it will burn forever this is what the lord says cursed is the one who trusts in man who depends on flesh for his strength and whose heart turns away from the lord he will be like a bush in the wastelands he will not see prosperity when it comes he will dwell in the parched places of the desert in a salt land where no one lives but blessed is the man who trusts in the lord whose confidence is in him he will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream it does not fear when heat comes its leaves are always green it has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure who can understand it i the lord search the heart and examine the mind to reward a man according to his conduct according to what his deeds deserve like a partridge that hatches eggs it did not lay is the man who gains riches by unjust means when his life is half gone they will desert him and in the end he will prove to be a fool a glorious throne exalted from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary o lord the hope of israel all who forsake you will be put to shame those who turn away from you will be written in the dust because they have forsaken the lord the spring of living water heal me o lord and i will be healed save me and i will be saved for you are the one i praise they keep saying to me where is the word of the lord let it now be fulfilled i have not run away from being your shepherd you know i have not desired the day of despair what passes my lips is open before you do not be a terror to me you are my refuge in the day of disaster let my persecutors be put to shame but keep me from shame let them be terrified but keep me from terror bring on them the day of disaster destroy them with double destruction this is what the lord said to me go and stand at the gate of the people through which the kings of judah go in and out stand also at all the other gates of jerusalem say to them hear the word of the lord o kings of judah and all people of judah and everyone living in jerusalem who come through these gates this is what the lord says be careful not to carry a load on the sabbath day or bring it through the gates of jerusalem do not bring a load out of your houses or do any work on the sabbath but keep the sabbath day holy as i commanded your forefathers yet they did not listen or pay attention they were stiff necked and would not listen or respond to discipline but if you are careful to obey me declares the lord and bring no load through the gates of this city on the sabbath but keep the sabbath day holy by not doing any work on it then kings who sit on davids throne will come through the gates of this city with their officials they and their officials will come riding in chariots and on horses accompanied by the men of judah and those living in jerusalem and this city will be inhabited forever people will come from the towns of judah and the villages around jerusalem from the territory of benjamin and the western foothills from the hill country and the negev bringing burnt offerings and sacrifices grain offerings incense and thank offerings to the house of the lord but if you do not obey me to keep the sabbath day holy by not carrying any load as you come through the gates of jerusalem on the sabbath day then i will kindle an unquenchable fire in the gates of jerusalem that will consume her fortresses this is the word that came to jeremiah from the lord go down to the potters house and there i will give you my message so i went down to the potters house and i saw him working at the wheel but the pot he was shaping from the clay was marred in his hands so the potter formed it into another pot shaping it as seemed best to him then the word of the lord came to me o house of israel can i not do with you as this potter does declares the lord like clay in the hand of the potter so are you in my hand o house of israel if at any time i announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted torn down and destroyed and if that nation i warned repents of its evil then i will relent and not inflict on it the disaster i had planned and if at another time i announce that a nation or kingdom is to be built up and planted and if it does evil in my sight and does not obey me then i will reconsider the good i had intended to do for it now therefore say to the people of judah and those living in jerusalem this is what the lord says look i am preparing a disaster for you and devising a plan against you so turn from your evil ways each one of you and reform your ways and your actions but they will reply its no use we will continue with our own plans each of us will follow the stubbornness of his evil heart therefore this is what the lord says inquire among the nations who has ever heard anything like this a most horrible thing has been done by virgin israel does the snow of lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes do its cool waters from distant sources ever cease to flow yet my people have forgotten me they burn incense to worthless idols which made them stumble in their ways and in the ancient paths they made them walk in bypaths and on roads not built up their land will be laid waste an object of lasting scorn all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads like a wind from the east i will scatter them before their enemies i will show them my back and not my face in the day of their disaster they said come lets make plans against jeremiah for the teaching of the law by the priest will not be lost nor will counsel from the wise nor the word from the prophets so come lets attack him with our tongues and pay no attention to anything he says listen to me o lord hear what my accusers are saying should good be repaid with evil yet they have dug a pit for me remember that i stood before you and spoke in their behalf to turn your wrath away from them so give their children over to famine hand them over to the power of the sword let their wives be made childless and widows let their men be put to death their young men slain by the sword in battle let a cry be heard from their houses when you suddenly bring invaders against them for they have dug a pit to capture me and have hidden snares for my feet but you know o lord all their plots to kill me do not forgive their crimes or blot out their sins from your sight let them be overthrown before you deal with them in the time of your anger this is what the lord says go and buy a clay jar from a potter take along some of the elders of the people and of the priests and go out to the valley of ben hinnom near the entrance of the potsherd gate there proclaim the words i tell you and say hear the word of the lord o kings of judah and people of jerusalem this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says listen i am going to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of everyone who hears of it tingle for they have forsaken me and made this a place of foreign gods they have burned sacrifices in it to gods that neither they nor their fathers nor the kings of judah ever knew and they have filled this place with the blood of the innocent they have built the high places of baal to burn their sons in the fire as offerings to baal something i did not command or mention nor did it enter my mind so beware the days are coming declares the lord when people will no longer call this place topheth or the valley of ben hinnom but the valley of slaughter in this place i will ruin the plans of judah and jerusalem i will make them fall by the sword before their enemies at the hands of those who seek their lives and i will give their carcasses as food to the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth i will devastate this city and make it an object of scorn all who pass by will be appalled and will scoff because of all its wounds i will make them eat the flesh of their sons and daughters and they will eat one anothers flesh during the stress of the siege imposed on them by the enemies who seek their lives then break the jar while those who go with you are watching and say to them this is what the lord almighty says i will smash this nation and this city just as this potters jar is smashed and cannot be repaired they will bury the dead in topheth until there is no more room this is what i will do to this place and to those who live here declares the lord i will make this city like topheth the houses in jerusalem and those of the kings of judah will be defiled like this place topheth all the houses where they burned incense on the roofs to all the starry hosts and poured out drink offerings to other gods jeremiah then returned from topheth where the lord had sent him to prophesy and stood in the court of the lords temple and said to all the people this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says listen i am going to bring on this city and the villages around it every disaster i pronounced against them because they were stiff necked and would not listen to my words when the priest pashhur son of immer the chief officer in the temple of the lord heard jeremiah prophesying these things he had jeremiah the prophet beaten and put in the stocks at the upper gate of benjamin at the lords temple the next day when pashhur released him from the stocks jeremiah said to him the lords name for you is not pashhur but magor missabib for this is what the lord says i will make you a terror to yourself and to all your friends with your own eyes you will see them fall by the sword of their enemies i will hand all judah over to the king of babylon who will carry them away to babylon or put them to the sword i will hand over to their enemies all the wealth of this city all its products all its valuables and all the treasures of the kings of judah they will take it away as plunder and carry it off to babylon and you pashhur and all who live in your house will go into exile to babylon there you will die and be buried you and all your friends to whom you have prophesied lies o lord you deceived me and i was deceived you overpowered me and prevailed i am ridiculed all day long everyone mocks me whenever i speak i cry out proclaiming violence and destruction so the word of the lord has brought me insult and reproach all day long but if i say i will not mention him or speak any more in his name his word is in my heart like a fire a fire shut up in my bones i am weary of holding it in indeed i cannot i hear many whispering terror on every side report him lets report him all my friends are waiting for me to slip saying perhaps he will be deceived then we will prevail over him and take our revenge on him but the lord is with me like a mighty warrior so my persecutors will stumble and not prevail they will fail and be thoroughly disgraced their dishonor will never be forgotten o lord almighty you who examine the righteous and probe the heart and mind let me see your vengeance upon them for to you i have committed my cause sing to the lord give praise to the lord he rescues the life of the needy from the hands of the wicked cursed be the day i was born may the day my mother bore me not be blessed cursed be the man who brought my father the news who made him very glad saying a child is born to you a son may that man be like the towns the lord overthrew without pity may he hear wailing in the morning a battle cry at noon for he did not kill me in the womb with my mother as my grave her womb enlarged forever why did i ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow and to end my days in shame the word came to jeremiah from the lord when king zedekiah sent to him pashhur son of malkijah and the priest zephaniah son of maaseiah they said inquire now of the lord for us because nebuchadnezzar king of babylon is attacking us perhaps the lord will perform wonders for us as in times past so that he will withdraw from us but jeremiah answered them tell zedekiah this is what the lord the god of israel says i am about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands which you are using to fight the king of babylon and the babylonians who are outside the wall besieging you and i will gather them inside this city i myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and a mighty arm in anger and fury and great wrath i will strike down those who live in this city both men and animals and they will die of a terrible plague after that declares the lord i will hand over zedekiah king of judah his officials and the people in this city who survive the plague sword and famine to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and to their enemies who seek their lives he will put them to the sword he will show them no mercy or pity or compassion furthermore tell the people this is what the lord says see i am setting before you the way of life and the way of death whoever stays in this city will die by the sword famine or plague but whoever goes out and surrenders to the babylonians who are besieging you will live he will escape with his life i have determined to do this city harm and not good declares the lord it will be given into the hands of the king of babylon and he will destroy it with fire moreover say to the royal house of judah hear the word of the lord o house of david this is what the lord says administer justice every morning rescue from the hand of his oppressor the one who has been robbed or my wrath will break out and burn like fire because of the evil you have done burn with no one to quench it i am against you jerusalem you who live above this valley on the rocky plateau declares the lord you who say who can come against us who can enter our refuge i will punish you as your deeds deserve declares the lord i will kindle a fire in your forests that will consume everything around you this is what the lord says go down to the palace of the king of judah and proclaim this message there hear the word of the lord o king of judah you who sit on davids throne you your officials and your people who come through these gates this is what the lord says do what is just and right rescue from the hand of his oppressor the one who has been robbed do no wrong or violence to the alien the fatherless or the widow and do not shed innocent blood in this place for if you are careful to carry out these commands then kings who sit on davids throne will come through the gates of this palace riding in chariots and on horses accompanied by their officials and their people but if you do not obey these commands declares the lord i swear by myself that this palace will become a ruin for this is what the lord says about the palace of the king of judah though you are like gilead to me like the summit of lebanon i will surely make you like a desert like towns not inhabited i will send destroyers against you each man with his weapons and they will cut up your fine cedar beams and throw them into the fire people from many nations will pass by this city and will ask one another why has the lord done such a thing to this great city and the answer will be because they have forsaken the covenant of the lord their god and have worshiped and served other gods do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss rather weep bitterly for him who is exiled because he will never return nor see his native land again for this is what the lord says about shallum son of josiah who succeeded his father as king of judah but has gone from this place he will never return he will die in the place where they have led him captive he will not see this land again woe to him who builds his palace by unrighteousness his upper rooms by injustice making his countrymen work for nothing not paying them for their labor he says i will build myself a great palace with spacious upper rooms so he makes large windows in it panels it with cedar and decorates it in red does it make you a king to have more and more cedar did not your father have food and drink he did what was right and just so all went well with him he defended the cause of the poor and needy and so all went well is that not what it means to know me declares the lord but your eyes and your heart are set only on dishonest gain on shedding innocent blood and on oppression and extortion therefore this is what the lord says about jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah they will not mourn for him alas my brother alas my sister they will not mourn for him alas my master alas his splendor he will have the burial of a donkey dragged away and thrown outside the gates of jerusalem go up to lebanon and cry out let your voice be heard in bashan cry out from abarim for all your allies are crushed i warned you when you felt secure but you said i will not listen this has been your way from your youth you have not obeyed me the wind will drive all your shepherds away and your allies will go into exile then you will be ashamed and disgraced because of all your wickedness you who live in lebanon who are nestled in cedar buildings how you will groan when pangs come upon you pain like that of a woman in labor as surely as i live declares the lord even if you jehoiachin son of jehoiakim king of judah were a signet ring on my right hand i would still pull you off i will hand you over to those who seek your life those you fear to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and to the babylonians i will hurl you and the mother who gave you birth into another country where neither of you was born and there you both will die you will never come back to the land you long to return to is this man jehoiachin a despised broken pot an object no one wants why will he and his children be hurled out cast into a land they do not know o land land land hear the word of the lord this is what the lord says record this man as if childless a man who will not prosper in his lifetime for none of his offspring will prosper none will sit on the throne of david or rule anymore in judah woe to the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture declares the lord therefore this is what the lord the god of israel says to the shepherds who tend my people because you have scattered my flock and driven them away and have not bestowed care on them i will bestow punishment on you for the evil you have done declares the lord i myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where i have driven them and will bring them back to their pasture where they will be fruitful and increase in number i will place shepherds over them who will tend them and they will no longer be afraid or terrified nor will any be missing declares the lord the days are coming declares the lord when i will raise up to david a righteous branch a king who will reign wisely and do what is just and right in the land in his days judah will be saved and israel will live in safety this is the name by which he will be called the lord our righteousness so then the days are coming declares the lord when people will no longer say as surely as the lord lives who brought the israelites up out of egypt but they will say as surely as the lord lives who brought the descendants of israel up out of the land of the north and out of all the countries where he had banished them then they will live in their own land concerning the prophets my heart is broken within me all my bones tremble i am like a drunken man like a man overcome by wine because of the lord and his holy words the land is full of adulterers because of the curse the land lies parched and the pastures in the desert are withered the prophets follow an evil course and use their power unjustly both prophet and priest are godless even in my temple i find their wickedness declares the lord therefore their path will become slippery they will be banished to darkness and there they will fall i will bring disaster on them in the year they are punished declares the lord among the prophets of samaria i saw this repulsive thing they prophesied by baal and led my people israel astray and among the prophets of jerusalem i have seen something horrible they commit adultery and live a lie they strengthen the hands of evildoers so that no one turns from his wickedness they are all like sodom to me the people of jerusalem are like gomorrah therefore this is what the lord almighty says concerning the prophets i will make them eat bitter food and drink poisoned water because from the prophets of jerusalem ungodliness has spread throughout the land this is what the lord almighty says do not listen to what the prophets are prophesying to you they fill you with false hopes they speak visions from their own minds not from the mouth of the lord they keep saying to those who despise me the lord says you will have peace and to all who follow the stubbornness of their hearts they say no harm will come to you but which of them has stood in the council of the lord to see or to hear his word who has listened and heard his word see the storm of the lord will burst out in wrath a whirlwind swirling down on the heads of the wicked the anger of the lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart in days to come you will understand it clearly i did not send these prophets yet they have run with their message i did not speak to them yet they have prophesied but if they had stood in my council they would have proclaimed my words to my people and would have turned them from their evil ways and from their evil deeds am i only a god nearby declares the lord and not a god far away can anyone hide in secret places so that i cannot see him declares the lord do not i fill heaven and earth declares the lord i have heard what the prophets say who prophesy lies in my name they say i had a dream i had a dream how long will this continue in the hearts of these lying prophets who prophesy the delusions of their own minds they think the dreams they tell one another will make my people forget my name just as their fathers forgot my name through baal worship let the prophet who has a dream tell his dream but let the one who has my word speak it faithfully for what has straw to do with grain declares the lord is not my word like fire declares the lord and like a hammer that breaks a rock in pieces therefore declares the lord i am against the prophets who steal from one another words supposedly from me yes declares the lord i am against the prophets who wag their own tongues and yet declare the lord declares indeed i am against those who prophesy false dreams declares the lord they tell them and lead my people astray with their reckless lies yet i did not send or appoint them they do not benefit these people in the least declares the lord when these people or a prophet or a priest ask you what is the oracle of the lord say to them what oracle i will forsake you declares the lord if a prophet or a priest or anyone else claims this is the oracle of the lord i will punish that man and his household this is what each of you keeps on saying to his friend or relative what is the lords answer or what has the lord spoken but you must not mention the oracle of the lord again because every mans own word becomes his oracle and so you distort the words of the living god the lord almighty our god this is what you keep saying to a prophet what is the lords answer to you or what has the lord spoken although you claim this is the oracle of the lord this is what the lord says you used the words this is the oracle of the lord even though i told you that you must not claim this is the oracle of the lord therefore i will surely forget you and cast you out of my presence along with the city i gave to you and your fathers i will bring upon you everlasting disgrace everlasting shame that will not be forgotten after jehoiachin son of jehoiakim king of judah and the officials the craftsmen and the artisans of judah were carried into exile from jerusalem to babylon by nebuchadnezzar king of babylon the lord showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the temple of the lord one basket had very good figs like those that ripen early the other basket had very poor figs so bad they could not be eaten then the lord asked me what do you see jeremiahfigs i answered the good ones are very good but the poor ones are so bad they cannot be eaten then the word of the lord came to me this is what the lord the god of israel says like these good figs i regard as good the exiles from judah whom i sent away from this place to the land of the babylonians my eyes will watch over them for their good and i will bring them back to this land i will build them up and not tear them down i will plant them and not uproot them i will give them a heart to know me that i am the lord they will be my people and i will be their god for they will return to me with all their heart but like the poor figs which are so bad they cannot be eaten says the lord so will i deal with zedekiah king of judah his officials and the survivors from jerusalem whether they remain in this land or live in egypt i will make them abhorrent and an offense to all the kingdoms of the earth a reproach and a byword an object of ridicule and cursing wherever i banish them i will send the sword famine and plague against them until they are destroyed from the land i gave to them and their fathers the word came to jeremiah concerning all the people of judah in the fourth year of jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah which was the first year of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon so jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of judah and to all those living in jerusalem for twenty three years from the thirteenth year of josiah son of amon king of judah until this very day the word of the lord has come to me and i have spoken to you again and again but you have not listened and though the lord has sent all his servants the prophets to you again and again you have not listened or paid any attention they said turn now each of you from your evil ways and your evil practices and you can stay in the land the lord gave to you and your fathers for ever and ever do not follow other gods to serve and worship them do not provoke me to anger with what your hands have made then i will not harm you but you did not listen to me declares the lord and you have provoked me with what your hands have made and you have brought harm to yourselves therefore the lord almighty says this because you have not listened to my words i will summon all the peoples of the north and my servant nebuchadnezzar king of babylon declares the lord and i will bring them against this land and its inhabitants and against all the surrounding nations i will completely destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn and an everlasting ruin i will banish from them the sounds of joy and gladness the voices of bride and bridegroom the sound of millstones and the light of the lamp this whole country will become a desolate wasteland and these nations will serve the king of babylon seventy years but when the seventy years are fulfilled i will punish the king of babylon and his nation the land of the babylonians for their guilt declares the lord and will make it desolate forever i will bring upon that land all the things i have spoken against it all that are written in this book and prophesied by jeremiah against all the nations they themselves will be enslaved by many nations and great kings i will repay them according to their deeds and the work of their hands this is what the lord the god of israel said to me take from my hand this cup filled with the wine of my wrath and make all the nations to whom i send you drink it when they drink it they will stagger and go mad because of the sword i will send among them so i took the cup from the lords hand and made all the nations to whom he sent me drink it jerusalem and the towns of judah its kings and officials to make them a ruin and an object of horror and scorn and cursing as they are today pharaoh king of egypt his attendants his officials and all his people and all the foreign people there all the kings of uz all the kings of the philistines those of ashkelon gaza ekron and the people left at ashdod edom moab and ammon all the kings of tyre and sidon the kings of the coastlands across the sea dedan tema buz and all who are in distant places all the kings of arabia and all the kings of the foreign people who live in the desert all the kings of zimri elam and media and all the kings of the north near and far one after the other all the kingdoms on the face of the earth and after all of them the king of sheshach will drink it too then tell them this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says drink get drunk and vomit and fall to rise no more because of the sword i will send among you but if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink tell them this is what the lord almighty says you must drink it see i am beginning to bring disaster on the city that bears my name and will you indeed go unpunished you will not go unpunished for i am calling down a sword upon all who live on the earth declares the lord almighty now prophesy all these words against them and say to them the lord will roar from on high he will thunder from his holy dwelling and roar mightily against his land he will shout like those who tread the grapes shout against all who live on the earth the tumult will resound to the ends of the earth for the lord will bring charges against the nations he will bring judgment on all mankind and put the wicked to the sword declares the lord this is what the lord almighty says look disaster is spreading from nation to nation a mighty storm is rising from the ends of the earth at that time those slain by the lord will be everywhere from one end of the earth to the other they will not be mourned or gathered up or buried but will be like refuse lying on the ground weep and wail you shepherds roll in the dust you leaders of the flock for your time to be slaughtered has come you will fall and be shattered like fine pottery the shepherds will have nowhere to flee the leaders of the flock no place to escape hear the cry of the shepherds the wailing of the leaders of the flock for the lord is destroying their pasture the peaceful meadows will be laid waste because of the fierce anger of the lord like a lion he will leave his lair and their land will become desolate because of the sword of the oppressor and because of the lords fierce anger early in the reign of jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah this word came from the lord this is what the lord says stand in the courtyard of the lords house and speak to all the people of the towns of judah who come to worship in the house of the lord tell them everything i command you do not omit a word perhaps they will listen and each will turn from his evil way then i will relent and not bring on them the disaster i was planning because of the evil they have done say to them this is what the lord says if you do not listen to me and follow my law which i have set before you and if you do not listen to the words of my servants the prophets whom i have sent to you again and again though you have not listened then i will make this house like shiloh and this city an object of cursing among all the nations of the earth the priests the prophets and all the people heard jeremiah speak these words in the house of the lord but as soon as jeremiah finished telling all the people everything the lord had commanded him to say the priests the prophets and all the people seized him and said you must die why do you prophesy in the lords name that this house will be like shiloh and this city will be desolate and deserted and all the people crowded around jeremiah in the house of the lord when the officials of judah heard about these things they went up from the royal palace to the house of the lord and took their places at the entrance of the new gate of the lords house then the priests and the prophets said to the officials and all the people this man should be sentenced to death because he has prophesied against this city you have heard it with your own ears then jeremiah said to all the officials and all the people the lord sent me to prophesy against this house and this city all the things you have heard now reform your ways and your actions and obey the lord your god then the lord will relent and not bring the disaster he has pronounced against you as for me i am in your hands do with me whatever you think is good and right be assured however that if you put me to death you will bring the guilt of innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and on those who live in it for in truth the lord has sent me to you to speak all these words in your hearing then the officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets this man should not be sentenced to death he has spoken to us in the name of the lord our god some of the elders of the land stepped forward and said to the entire assembly of people micah of moresheth prophesied in the days of hezekiah king of judah he told all the people of judah this is what the lord almighty says zion will be plowed like a field jerusalem will become a heap of rubble the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets did hezekiah king of judah or anyone else in judah put him to death did not hezekiah fear the lord and seek his favor and did not the lord relent so that he did not bring the disaster he pronounced against them we are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves now uriah son of shemaiah from kiriath jearim was another man who prophesied in the name of the lord he prophesied the same things against this city and this land as jeremiah did when king jehoiakim and all his officers and officials heard his words the king sought to put him to death but uriah heard of it and fled in fear to egypt king jehoiakim however sent elnathan son of acbor to egypt along with some other men they brought uriah out of egypt and took him to king jehoiakim who had him struck down with a sword and his body thrown into the burial place of the common people furthermore ahikam son of shaphan supported jeremiah and so he was not handed over to the people to be put to death early in the reign of zedekiah son of josiah king of judah this word came to jeremiah from the lord this is what the lord said to me make a yoke out of straps and crossbars and put it on your neck then send word to the kings of edom moab ammon tyre and sidon through the envoys who have come to jerusalem to zedekiah king of judah give them a message for their masters and say this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says tell this to your masters with my great power and outstretched arm i made the earth and its people and the animals that are on it and i give it to anyone i please now i will hand all your countries over to my servant nebuchadnezzar king of babylon i will make even the wild animals subject to him all nations will serve him and his son and his grandson until the time for his land comes then many nations and great kings will subjugate him if however any nation or kingdom will not serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon or bow its neck under his yoke i will punish that nation with the sword famine and plague declares the lord until i destroy it by his hand so do not listen to your prophets your diviners your interpreters of dreams your mediums or your sorcerers who tell you you will not serve the king of babylon they prophesy lies to you that will only serve to remove you far from your lands i will banish you and you will perish but if any nation will bow its neck under the yoke of the king of babylon and serve him i will let that nation remain in its own land to till it and to live there declares the lord i gave the same message to zedekiah king of judah i said bow your neck under the yoke of the king of babylon serve him and his people and you will live why will you and your people die by the sword famine and plague with which the lord has threatened any nation that will not serve the king of babylon do not listen to the words of the prophets who say to you you will not serve the king of babylon for they are prophesying lies to you i have not sent them declares the lord they are prophesying lies in my name therefore i will banish you and you will perish both you and the prophets who prophesy to you then i said to the priests and all these people this is what the lord says do not listen to the prophets who say very soon now the articles from the lords house will be brought back from babylon they are prophesying lies to you do not listen to them serve the king of babylon and you will live why should this city become a ruin if they are prophets and have the word of the lord let them plead with the lord almighty that the furnishings remaining in the house of the lord and in the palace of the king of judah and in jerusalem not be taken to babylon for this is what the lord almighty says about the pillars the sea the movable stands and the other furnishings that are left in this city which nebuchadnezzar king of babylon did not take away when he carried jehoiachin son of jehoiakim king of judah into exile from jerusalem to babylon along with all the nobles of judah and jerusalem yes this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says about the things that are left in the house of the lord and in the palace of the king of judah and in jerusalem they will be taken to babylon and there they will remain until the day i come for them declares the lord then i will bring them back and restore them to this place in the fifth month of that same year the fourth year early in the reign of zedekiah king of judah the prophet hananiah son of azzur who was from gibeon said to me in the house of the lord in the presence of the priests and all the people this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i will break the yoke of the king of babylon within two years i will bring back to this place all the articles of the lords house that nebuchadnezzar king of babylon removed from here and took to babylon i will also bring back to this place jehoiachin son of jehoiakim king of judah and all the other exiles from judah who went to babylon declares the lord for i will break the yoke of the king of babylon then the prophet jeremiah replied to the prophet hananiah before the priests and all the people who were standing in the house of the lord he said amen may the lord do so may the lord fulfill the words you have prophesied by bringing the articles of the lords house and all the exiles back to this place from babylon nevertheless listen to what i have to say in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people from early times the prophets who preceded you and me have prophesied war disaster and plague against many countries and great kingdoms but the prophet who prophesies peace will be recognized as one truly sent by the lord only if his prediction comes true then the prophet hananiah took the yoke off the neck of the prophet jeremiah and broke it and he said before all the people this is what the lord says in the same way will i break the yoke of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon off the neck of all the nations within two years at this the prophet jeremiah went on his way shortly after the prophet hananiah had broken the yoke off the neck of the prophet jeremiah the word of the lord came to jeremiah go and tell hananiah this is what the lord says you have broken a wooden yoke but in its place you will get a yoke of iron this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i will put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to make them serve nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and they will serve him i will even give him control over the wild animals then the prophet jeremiah said to hananiah the prophet listen hananiah the lord has not sent you yet you have persuaded this nation to trust in lies therefore this is what the lord says i am about to remove you from the face of the earth this very year you are going to die because you have preached rebellion against the lord in the seventh month of that same year hananiah the prophet died this is the text of the letter that the prophet jeremiah sent from jerusalem to the surviving elders among the exiles and to the priests the prophets and all the other people nebuchadnezzar had carried into exile from jerusalem to babylon this was after king jehoiachin and the queen mother the court officials and the leaders of judah and jerusalem the craftsmen and the artisans had gone into exile from jerusalem he entrusted the letter to elasah son of shaphan and to gemariah son of hilkiah whom zedekiah king of judah sent to king nebuchadnezzar in babylon it said this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says to all those i carried into exile from jerusalem to babylon build houses and settle down plant gardens and eat what they produce marry and have sons and daughters find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage so that they too may have sons and daughters increase in number there do not decrease also seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which i have carried you into exile pray to the lord for it because if it prospers you too will prosper yes this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says do not let the prophets and diviners among you deceive you do not listen to the dreams you encourage them to have they are prophesying lies to you in my name i have not sent them declares the lord this is what the lord says when seventy years are completed for babylon i will come to you and fulfill my gracious promise to bring you back to this place for i know the plans i have for you declares the lord plans to prosper you and not to harm you plans to give you hope and a future then you will call upon me and come and pray to me and i will listen to you you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart i will be found by you declares the lord and will bring you back from captivity i will gather you from all the nations and places where i have banished you declares the lord and will bring you back to the place from which i carried you into exile you may say the lord has raised up prophets for us in babylon but this is what the lord says about the king who sits on davids throne and all the people who remain in this city your countrymen who did not go with you into exile yes this is what the lord almighty says i will send the sword famine and plague against them and i will make them like poor figs that are so bad they cannot be eaten i will pursue them with the sword famine and plague and will make them abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth and an object of cursing and horror of scorn and reproach among all the nations where i drive them for they have not listened to my words declares the lord words that i sent to them again and again by my servants the prophets and you exiles have not listened either declares the lord therefore hear the word of the lord all you exiles whom i have sent away from jerusalem to babylon this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says about ahab son of kolaiah and zedekiah son of maaseiah who are prophesying lies to you in my name i will hand them over to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and he will put them to death before your very eyes because of them all the exiles from judah who are in babylon will use this curse the lord treat you like zedekiah and ahab whom the king of babylon burned in the fire for they have done outrageous things in israel they have committed adultery with their neighbors wives and in my name have spoken lies which i did not tell them to do i know it and am a witness to it declares the lord tell shemaiah the nehelamite this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says you sent letters in your own name to all the people in jerusalem to zephaniah son of maaseiah the priest and to all the other priests you said to zephaniah the lord has appointed you priest in place of jehoiada to be in charge of the house of the lord you should put any madman who acts like a prophet into the stocks and neck irons so why have you not reprimanded jeremiah from anathoth who poses as a prophet among you he has sent this message to us in babylon it will be a long time therefore build houses and settle down plant gardens and eat what they produce zephaniah the priest however read the letter to jeremiah the prophet then the word of the lord came to jeremiah send this message to all the exiles this is what the lord says about shemaiah the nehelamite because shemaiah has prophesied to you even though i did not send him and has led you to believe a lie this is what the lord says i will surely punish shemaiah the nehelamite and his descendants he will have no one left among this people nor will he see the good things i will do for my people declares the lord because he has preached rebellion against me this is the word that came to jeremiah from the lord this is what the lord the god of israel says write in a book all the words i have spoken to you the days are coming declares the lord when i will bring my people israel and judah back from captivity and restore them to the land i gave their forefathers to possess says the lord these are the words the lord spoke concerning israel and judah this is what the lord says cries of fear are heard terror not peace ask and see can a man bear children then why do i see every strong man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor every face turned deathly pale how awful that day will be none will be like it it will be a time of trouble for jacob but he will be saved out of it in that day declares the lord almighty i will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds no longer will foreigners enslave them instead they will serve the lord their god and david their king whom i will raise up for them so do not fear o jacob my servant do not be dismayed o israel declares the lord i will surely save you out of a distant place your descendants from the land of their exile jacob will again have peace and security and no one will make him afraid i am with you and will save you declares the lord though i completely destroy all the nations among which i scatter you i will not completely destroy you i will discipline you but only with justice i will not let you go entirely unpunished this is what the lord says your wound is incurable your injury beyond healing there is no one to plead your cause no remedy for your sore no healing for you all your allies have forgotten you they care nothing for you i have struck you as an enemy would and punished you as would the cruel because your guilt is so great and your sins so many why do you cry out over your wound your pain that has no cure because of your great guilt and many sins i have done these things to you but all who devour you will be devoured all your enemies will go into exile those who plunder you will be plundered all who make spoil of you i will despoil but i will restore you to health and heal your wounds declares the lord because you are called an outcast zion for whom no one cares this is what the lord says i will restore the fortunes of jacobs tents and have compassion on his dwellings the city will be rebuilt on her ruins and the palace will stand in its proper place from them will come songs of thanksgiving and the sound of rejoicing i will add to their numbers and they will not be decreased i will bring them honor and they will not be disdained their children will be as in days of old and their community will be established before me i will punish all who oppress them their leader will be one of their own their ruler will arise from among them i will bring him near and he will come close to me for who is he who will devote himself to be close to me declares the lord so you will be my people and i will be your god see the storm of the lord will burst out in wrath a driving wind swirling down on the heads of the wicked the fierce anger of the lord will not turn back until he fully accomplishes the purposes of his heart in days to come you will understand this at that time declares the lord i will be the god of all the clans of israel and they will be my people this is what the lord says the people who survive the sword will find favor in the desert i will come to give rest to israel the lord appeared to us in the past saying i have loved you with an everlasting love i have drawn you with loving kindness i will build you up again and you will be rebuilt o virgin israel again you will take up your tambourines and go out to dance with the joyful

them from the land of the north and gather them from the ends of the earth among them will be the blind and the lame expectant mothers and women in labor a great throng will return they will come with weeping they will pray as i bring them back i will lead them beside streams of water on a level path where they will not stumble because i am israels father and ephraim is my firstborn son hear the word of the lord o nations proclaim it in distant coastlands he who scattered israel will gather them and will watch over his flock like a shepherd for the lord will ransom jacob and redeem them from the hand of those stronger than they they will come and shout for joy on the heights of zion they will rejoice in the bounty of the lord the grain the new wine and the oil the young of the flocks and herds they will be like a well watered garden and they will sorrow no more then maidens will dance and be glad young men and old as well i will turn their mourning into gladness i will give them comfort and joy instead of sorrow i will satisfy the priests with abundance and my people will be filled with my bounty declares the lord this is what the lord says a voice is heard in ramah mourning and great weeping rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because her children are no more this is what the lord says restrain your voice from weeping and your eyes from tears for your work will be rewarded declares the lord they will return from the land of the enemy so there is hope for your future declares the lord your children will return to their own land i have surely heard ephraims moaning you disciplined me like an unruly calf and i have been disciplined restore me and i will return because you are the lord my god after i strayed i repented after i came to understand i beat my breast i was ashamed and humiliated because i bore the disgrace of my youth is not ephraim my dear son the child in whom i delight though i often speak against him i still remember him therefore my heart yearns for him i have great compassion for him declares the lord set up road signs put up guideposts take note of the highway the road that you take return o virgin israel return to your towns how long will you wander o unfaithful daughter the lord will create a new thing on earth a woman will surround a man this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says when i bring them back from captivity the people in the land of judah and in its towns will once again use these words the lord bless you o righteous dwelling o sacred mountain people will live together in judah and all its towns farmers and those who move about with their flocks i will refresh the weary and satisfy the faint at this i awoke and looked around my sleep had been pleasant to me the days are coming declares the lord when i will plant the house of israel and the house of judah with the offspring of men and of animals just as i watched over them to uproot and tear down and to overthrow destroy and bring disaster so i will watch over them to build and to plant declares the lord in those days people will no longer say the fathers have eaten sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge instead everyone will die for his own sin whoever eats sour grapes his own teeth will be set on edge the time is coming declares the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah it will not be like the covenant i made with their forefathers when i took them by the hand to lead them out of egypt because they broke my covenant though i was a husband to them declares the lord this is the covenant i will make with the house of israel after that time declares the lord i will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts i will be their god and they will be my people no longer will a man teach his neighbor or a man his brother saying know the lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest declares the lord for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more this is what the lord says he who appoints the sun to shine by day who decrees the moon and stars to shine by night who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar the lord almighty is his name only if these decrees vanish from my sight declares the lord will the descendants of israel ever cease to be a nation before me this is what the lord says only if the heavens above can be measured and the foundations of the earth below be searched out will i reject all the descendants of israel because of all they have done declares the lord the days are coming declares the lord when this city will be rebuilt for me from the tower of hananel to the corner gate the measuring line will stretch from there straight to the hill of gareb and then turn to goah the whole valley where dead bodies and ashes are thrown and all the terraces out to the kidron valley on the east as far as the corner of the horse gate will be holy to the lord the city will never again be uprooted or demolished this is the word that came to jeremiah from the lord in the tenth year of zedekiah king of judah which was the eighteenth year of nebuchadnezzar the army of the king of babylon was then besieging jerusalem and jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace of judah now zedekiah king of judah had imprisoned him there saying why do you prophesy as you do you say this is what the lord says i am about to hand this city over to the king of babylon and he will capture it zedekiah king of judah will not escape out of the hands of the babylonians but will certainly be handed over to the king of babylon and will speak with him face to face and see him with his own eyes he will take zedekiah to babylon where he will remain until i deal with him declares the lord if you fight against the babylonians you will not succeed jeremiah said the word of the lord came to me hanamel son of shallum your uncle is going to come to you and say buy my field at anathoth because as nearest relative it is your right and duty to buy it then just as the lord had said my cousin hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard and said buy my field at anathoth in the territory of benjamin since it is your right to redeem it and possess it buy it for yourselfi knew that this was the word of the lord so i bought the field at anathoth from my cousin hanamel and weighed out for him seventeen shekels of silver i signed and sealed the deed had it witnessed and weighed out the silver on the scales i took the deed of purchase the sealed copy containing the terms and conditions as well as the unsealed copy and i gave this deed to baruch son of neriah the son of mahseiah in the presence of my cousin hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed and of all the jews sitting in the courtyard of the guard in their presence i gave baruch these instructions this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says take these documents both the sealed and unsealed copies of the deed of purchase and put them in a clay jar so they will last a long time for this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says houses fields and vineyards will again be bought in this land after i had given the deed of purchase to baruch son of neriah i prayed to the lord ah sovereign lord you have made the heavens and the earth by your great power and outstretched arm nothing is too hard for you you show love to thousands but bring the punishment for the fathers sins into the laps of their children after them o great and powerful god whose name is the lord almighty great are your purposes and mighty are your deeds your eyes are open to all the ways of men you reward everyone according to his conduct and as his deeds deserve you performed miraculous signs and wonders in egypt and have continued them to this day both in israel and among all mankind and have gained the renown that is still yours you brought your people israel out of egypt with signs and wonders by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror you gave them this land you had sworn to give their forefathers a land flowing with milk and honey they came in and took possession of it but they did not obey you or follow your law they did not do what you commanded them to do so you brought all this disaster upon them see how the siege ramps are built up to take the city because of the sword famine and plague the city will be handed over to the babylonians who are attacking it what you said has happened as you now see and though the city will be handed over to the babylonians you o sovereign lord say to me buy the field with silver and have the transaction witnessed then the word of the lord came to jeremiah i am the lord the god of all mankind is anything too hard for me therefore this is what the lord says i am about to hand this city over to the babylonians and to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon who will capture it the babylonians who are attacking this city will come in and set it on fire they will burn it down along with the houses where the people provoked me to anger by burning incense on the roofs to baal and by pouring out drink offerings to other gods the people of israel and judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth indeed the people of israel have done nothing but provoke me with what their hands have made declares the lord from the day it was built until now this city has so aroused my anger and wrath that i must remove it from my sight the people of israel and judah have provoked me by all the evil they have done they their kings and officials their priests and prophets the men of judah and the people of jerusalem they turned their backs to me and not their faces though i taught them again and again they would not listen or respond to discipline they set up their abominable idols in the house that bears my name and defiled it they built high places for baal in the valley of ben hinnom to sacrifice their sons and daughters to molech though i never commanded nor did it enter my mind that they should do such a detestable thing and so make judah sin you are saying about this city by the sword famine and plague it will be handed over to the king of babylon but this is what the lord the god of israel says i will surely gather them from all the lands where i banish them in my furious anger and great wrath i will bring them back to this place and let them live in safety they will be my people and i will be their god i will give them singleness of heart and action so that they will always fear me for their own good and the good of their children after them i will make an everlasting covenant with them i will never stop doing good to them and i will inspire them to fear me so that they will never turn away from me i will rejoice in doing them good and will assuredly plant them in this land with all my heart and soul this is what the lord says as i have brought all this great calamity on this people so i will give them all the prosperity i have promised them once more fields will be bought in this land of which you say it is a desolate waste without men or animals for it has been handed over to the babylonians fields will be bought for silver and deeds will be signed sealed and witnessed in the territory of benjamin in the villages around jerusalem in the towns of judah and in the towns of the hill country of the western foothills and of the negev because i will restore their fortunes declares the lord while jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard the word of the lord came to him a second time this is what the lord says he who made the earth the lord who formed it and established it the lord is his name call to me and i will answer you and tell you great and unsearchable things you do not know for this is what the lord the god of israel says about the houses in this city and the royal palaces of judah that have been torn down to be used against the siege ramps and the sword in the fight with the babylonians they will be filled with the dead bodies of the men i will slay in my anger and wrath i will hide my face from this city because of all its wickedness nevertheless i will bring health and healing to it i will heal my people and will let them enjoy abundant peace and security i will bring judah and israel back from captivity and will rebuild them as they were before i will cleanse them from all the sin they have committed against me and will forgive all their sins of rebellion against me then this city will bring me renown joy praise and honor before all nations on earth that hear of all the good things i do for it and they will be in awe and will tremble at the abundant prosperity and peace i provide for it this is what the lord says you say about this place it is a desolate waste without men or animals yet in the towns of judah and the streets of jerusalem that are deserted inhabited by neither men nor animals there will be heard once more the sounds of joy and gladness the voices of bride and bridegroom and the voices of those who bring thank offerings to the house of the lord saying give thanks to the lord almighty for the lord is good his love endures forever for i will restore the fortunes of the land as they were before says the lord this is what the lord almighty says in this place desolate and without men or animals in all its towns there will again be pastures for shepherds to rest their flocks in the towns of the hill country of the western foothills and of the negev in the territory of benjamin in the villages around jerusalem and in the towns of judah flocks will again pass under the hand of the one who counts them says the lord the days are coming declares the lord when i will fulfill the gracious promise i made to the house of israel and to the house of judah in those days and at that time i will make a righteous branch sprout from davids line he will do what is just and right in the land in those days judah will be saved and jerusalem will live in safety this is the name by which it will be called the lord our righteousness for this is what the lord says david will never fail to have a man to sit on the throne of the house of israel nor will the priests who are levites ever fail to have a man to stand before me continually to offer burnt offerings to burn grain offerings and to present sacrifices the word of the lord came to jeremiah this is what the lord says if you can break my covenant with the day and my covenant with the night so that day and night no longer come at their appointed time then my covenant with david my servant and my covenant with the levites who are priests ministering before me can be broken and david will no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne i will make the descendants of david my servant and the levites who minister before me as countless as the stars of the sky and as measureless as the sand on the seashore the word of the lord came to jeremiah have you not noticed that these people are saying the lord has rejected the two kingdoms he chose so they despise my people and no longer regard them as a nation this is what the lord says if i have not established my covenant with day and night and the fixed laws of heaven and earth then i will reject the descendants of jacob and david my servant and will not choose one of his sons to rule over the descendants of abraham isaac and jacob for i will restore their fortunes and have compassion on them while nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and all his army and all the kingdoms and peoples in the empire he ruled were fighting against jerusalem and all its surrounding towns this word came to jeremiah from the lord this is what the lord the god of israel says go to zedekiah king of judah and tell him this is what the lord says i am about to hand this city over to the king of babylon and he will burn it down you will not escape from his grasp but will surely be captured and handed over to him you will see the king of babylon with your own eyes and he will speak with you face to face and you will go to babylon yet hear the promise of the lord o zedekiah king of judah this is what the lord says concerning you you will not die by the sword you will die peacefully as people made a funeral fire in honor of your fathers the former kings who preceded you so they will make a fire in your honor and lament alas o master i myself make this promise declares the lord then jeremiah the prophet told all this to zedekiah king of judah in jerusalem while the army of the king of babylon was fighting against jerusalem and the other cities of judah that were still holding out lachish and azekah these were the only fortified cities left in judah the word came to jeremiah from the lord after king zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in jerusalem to proclaim freedom for the slaves everyone was to free his hebrew slaves both male and female no one was to hold a fellow jew in bondage so all the officials and people who entered into this covenant agreed that they would free their male and female slaves and no longer hold them in bondage they agreed and set them free but afterward they changed their minds and took back the slaves they had freed and enslaved them again then the word of the lord came to jeremiah this is what the lord the god of israel says i made a covenant with your forefathers when i brought them out of egypt out of the land of slavery i said every seventh year each of you must free any fellow hebrew who has sold himself to you after he has served you six years you must let him go free your fathers however did not listen to me or pay attention to me recently you repented and did what is right in my sight each of you proclaimed freedom to his countrymen you even made a covenant before me in the house that bears my name but now you have turned around and profaned my name each of you has taken back the male and female slaves you had set free to go where they wished you have forced them to become your slaves again therefore this is what the lord says you have not obeyed me you have not proclaimed freedom for your fellow countrymen so i now proclaim freedom for you declares the lord freedom to fall by the sword plague and famine i will make you abhorrent to all the kingdoms of the earth the men who have violated my covenant and have not fulfilled the terms of the covenant they made before me i will treat like the calf they cut in two and then walked between its pieces the leaders of judah and jerusalem the court officials the priests and all the people of the land who walked between the pieces of the calf i will hand over to their enemies who seek their lives their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the air and the beasts of the earth i will hand zedekiah king of judah and his officials over to their enemies who seek their lives to the army of the king of babylon which has withdrawn from you i am going to give the order declares the lord and i will bring them back to this city they will fight against it take it and burn it down and i will lay waste the towns of judah so no one can live there this is the word that came to jeremiah from the lord during the reign of jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah go to the recabite family and invite them to come to one of the side rooms of the house of the lord and give them wine to drink so i went to get jaazaniah son of jeremiah the son of habazziniah and his brothers and all his sons the whole family of the recabites i brought them into the house of the lord into the room of the sons of hanan son of igdaliah the man of god it was next to the room of the officials which was over that of maaseiah son of shallum the doorkeeper then i set bowls full of wine and some cups before the men of the recabite family and said to them drink some wine but they replied we do not drink wine because our forefather jonadab son of recab gave us this command neither you nor your descendants must ever drink wine also you must never build houses sow seed or plant vineyards you must never have any of these things but must always live in tents then you will live a long time in the land where you are nomads we have obeyed everything our forefather jonadab son of recab commanded us neither we nor our wives nor our sons and daughters have ever drunk wine or built houses to live in or had vineyards fields or crops we have lived in tents and have fully obeyed everything our forefather jonadab commanded us but when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon invaded this land we said come we must go to jerusalem to escape the babylonian and aramean armies so we have remained in jerusalem then the word of the lord came to jeremiah saying this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says go and tell the men of judah and the people of jerusalem will you not learn a lesson and obey my words declares the lord jonadab son of recab ordered his sons not to drink wine and this command has been kept to this day they do not drink wine because they obey their forefathers command but i have spoken to you again and again yet you have not obeyed me again and again i sent all my servants the prophets to you they said each of you must turn from your wicked ways and reform your actions do not follow other gods to serve them then you will live in the land i have given to you and your fathers but you have not paid attention or listened to me the descendants of jonadab son of recab have carried out the command their forefather gave them but these people have not obeyed me therefore this is what the lord god almighty the god of israel says listen i am going to bring on judah and on everyone living in jerusalem every disaster i pronounced against them i spoke to them but they did not listen i called to them but they did not answer then jeremiah said to the family of the recabites this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says you have obeyed the command of your forefather jonadab and have followed all his instructions and have done everything he ordered therefore this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says jonadab son of recab will never fail to have a man to serve me in the fourth year of jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah this word came to jeremiah from the lord take a scroll and write on it all the words i have spoken to you concerning israel judah and all the other nations from the time i began speaking to you in the reign of josiah till now perhaps when the people of judah hear about every disaster i plan to inflict on them each of them will turn from his wicked way then i will forgive their wickedness and their sin so jeremiah called baruch son of neriah and while jeremiah dictated all the words the lord had spoken to him baruch wrote them on the scroll then jeremiah told baruch i am restricted i cannot go to the lords temple so you go to the house of the lord on a day of fasting and read to the people from the scroll the words of the lord that you wrote as i dictated read them to all the people of judah who come in from their towns perhaps they will bring their petition before the lord and each will turn from his wicked ways for the anger and wrath pronounced against this people by the lord are great baruch son of neriah did everything jeremiah the prophet told him to do at the lords temple he read the words of the lord from the scroll in the ninth month of the fifth year of jehoiakim son of josiah king of judah a time of fasting before the lord was proclaimed for all the people in jerusalem and those who had come from the towns of judah from the room of gemariah son of shaphan the secretary which was in the upper courtyard at the entrance of the new gate of the temple baruch read to all the people at the lords temple the words of jeremiah from the scroll when micaiah son of gemariah the son of shaphan heard all the words of the lord from the scroll he went down to the secretarys room in the royal palace where all the officials were sitting elishama the secretary delaiah son of shemaiah elnathan son of acbor gemariah son of shaphan zedekiah son of hananiah and all the other officials after micaiah told them everything he had heard baruch read to the people from the scroll all the officials sent jehudi son of nethaniah the son of shelemiah the son of cushi to say to baruch bring the scroll from which you have read to the people and come so baruch son of neriah went to them with the scroll in his hand they said to him sit down please and read it to us so baruch read it to them when they heard all these words they looked at each other in fear and said to baruch we must report all these words to the king then they asked baruch tell us how did you come to write all this did jeremiah dictate it yes baruch replied he dictated all these words to me and i wrote them in ink on the scroll then the officials said to baruch you and jeremiah go and hide dont let anyone know where you are after they put the scroll in the room of elishama the secretary they went to the king in the courtyard and reported everything to him the king sent jehudi to get the scroll and jehudi brought it from the room of elishama the secretary and read it to the king and all the officials standing beside him it was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter apartment with a fire burning in the firepot in front of him whenever jehudi had read three or four columns of the scroll the king cut them off with a scribes knife and threw them into the firepot until the entire scroll was burned in the fire the king and all his attendants who heard all these words showed no fear nor did they tear their clothes even though elnathan delaiah and gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll he would not listen to them instead the king commanded jerahmeel a son of the king seraiah son of azriel and shelemiah son of abdeel to arrest baruch the scribe and jeremiah the prophet but the lord had hidden them after the king burned the scroll containing the words that baruch had written at jeremiahs dictation the word of the lord came to jeremiah take another scroll and write on it all the words that were on the first scroll which jehoiakim king of judah burned up also tell jehoiakim king of judah this is what the lord says you burned that scroll and said why did you write on it that the king of babylon would certainly come and destroy this land and cut off both men and animals from it therefore this is what the lord says about jehoiakim king of judah he will have no one to sit on the throne of david his body will be thrown out and exposed to the heat by day and the frost by night i will punish him and his children and his attendants for their wickedness i will bring on them and those living in jerusalem and the people of judah every disaster i pronounced against them because they have not listened so jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to the scribe baruch son of neriah and as jeremiah dictated baruch wrote on it all the words of the scroll that jehoiakim king of judah had burned in the fire and many similar words were added to them zedekiah son of josiah was made king of judah by nebuchadnezzar king of babylon he reigned in place of jehoiachin son of jehoiakim neither he nor his attendants nor the people of the land paid any attention to the words the lord had spoken through jeremiah the prophet king zedekiah however sent jehucal son of shelemiah with the priest zephaniah son of maaseiah to jeremiah the prophet with this message please pray to the lord our god for us now jeremiah was free to come and go among the people for he had not yet been put in prison pharaohs army had marched out of egypt and when the babylonians who were besieging jerusalem heard the report about them they withdrew from jerusalem then the word of the lord came to jeremiah the prophet this is what the lord the god of israel says tell the king of judah who sent you to inquire of me pharaohs army which has marched out to support you will go back to its own land to egypt then the babylonians will return and attack this city they will capture it and burn it down this is what the lord says do not deceive yourselves thinking the babylonians will surely leave us they will not even if you were to defeat the entire babylonian army that is attacking you and only wounded men were left in their tents they would come out and burn this city down after the babylonian army had withdrawn from jerusalem because of pharaohs army jeremiah started to leave the city to go to the territory of benjamin to get his share of the property among the people there but when he reached the benjamin gate the captain of the guard whose name was irijah son of shelemiah the son of hananiah arrested him and said you are deserting to the babylonians thats not true jeremiah said i am not deserting to the babylonians but irijah would not listen to him instead he arrested jeremiah and brought him to the officials they were angry with jeremiah and had him beaten and imprisoned in the house of jonathan the secretary which they had made into a prison jeremiah was put into a vaulted cell in a dungeon where he remained a long time then king zedekiah sent for him and had him brought to the palace where he asked him privately is there any word from the lordyes jeremiah replied you will be handed over to the king of babylon then jeremiah said to king zedekiah what crime have i committed against you or your officials or this people that you have put me in prison where are your prophets who prophesied to you the king of babylon will not attack you or this land but now my lord the king please listen let me bring my petition before you do not send me back to the house of jonathan the secretary or i will die there king zedekiah then gave orders for jeremiah to be placed in the courtyard of the guard and given bread from the street of the bakers each day until all the bread in the city was gone so jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard shephatiah son of mattan gedaliah son of pashhur jehucal son of shelemiah and pashhur son of malkijah heard what jeremiah was telling all the people when he said this is what the lord says whoever stays in this city will die by the sword famine or plague but whoever goes over to the babylonians will live he will escape with his life he will live and this is what the lord says this city will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of babylon who will capture it then the officials said to the king this man should be put to death he is discouraging the soldiers who are left in this city as well as all the people by the things he is saying to them this man is not seeking the good of these people but their ruin he is in your hands king zedekiah answered the king can do nothing to oppose you so they took jeremiah and put him into the cistern of malkijah the kings son which was in the courtyard of the guard they lowered jeremiah by ropes into the cistern it had no water in it only mud and jeremiah sank down into the mud but ebed melech a cushite an official in the royal palace heard that they had put jeremiah into the cistern while the king was sitting in the benjamin gate ebed melech went out of the palace and said to him my lord the king these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to jeremiah the prophet they have thrown him into a cistern where he will starve to death when there is no longer any bread in the city then the king commanded ebed melech the cushite take thirty men from here with you and lift jeremiah the prophet out of the cistern before he dies so ebed melech took the men with him and went to a room under the treasury in the palace he took some old rags and worn out clothes from there and let them down with ropes to jeremiah in the cistern ebed melech the cushite said to jeremiah put these old rags and worn out clothes under your arms to pad the ropes jeremiah did so and they pulled him up with the ropes and lifted him out of the cistern and jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard then king zedekiah sent for jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to the third entrance to the temple of the lord i am going to ask you something the king said to jeremiah do not hide anything from me jeremiah said to zedekiah if i give you an answer will you not kill me even if i did give you counsel you would not listen to me but king zedekiah swore this oath secretly to jeremiah as surely as the lord lives who has given us breath i will neither kill you nor hand you over to those who are seeking your life then jeremiah said to zedekiah this is what the lord god almighty the god of israel says if you surrender to the officers of the king of babylon your life will be spared and this city will not be burned down you and your family will live but if you will not surrender to the officers of the king of babylon this city will be handed over to the babylonians and they will burn it down you yourself will not escape from their hands king zedekiah said to jeremiah i am afraid of the jews who have gone over to the babylonians for the babylonians may hand me over to them and they will mistreat me they will not hand you over jeremiah replied obey the lord by doing what i tell you then it will go well with you and your life will be spared but if you refuse to surrender this is what the lord has revealed to me all the women left in the palace of the king of judah will be brought out to the officials of the king of babylon those women will say to you they misled you and overcame you those trusted friends of yours your feet are sunk in the mud your friends have deserted you all your wives and children will be brought out to the babylonians you yourself will not escape from their hands but will be captured by the king of babylon and this city will be burned down then zedekiah said to jeremiah do not let anyone know about this conversation or you may die if the officials hear that i talked with you and they come to you and say tell us what you said to the king and what the king said to you do not hide it from us or we will kill you then tell them i was pleading with the king not to send me back to jonathans house to die there all the officials did come to jeremiah and question him and he told them everything the king had ordered him to say so they said no more to him for no one had heard his conversation with the king and jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day jerusalem was captured this is how jerusalem was taken in the ninth year of zedekiah king of judah in the tenth month nebuchadnezzar king of babylon marched against jerusalem with his whole army and laid siege to it and on the ninth day of the fourth month of zedekiahs eleventh year the city wall was broken through then all the officials of the king of babylon came and took seats in the middle gate nergal sharezer of samgar nebo sarsekim a chief officer nergal sharezer a high official and all the other officials of the king of babylon when zedekiah king of judah and all the soldiers saw them they fled they left the city at night by way of the kings garden through the gate between the two walls and headed toward the arabah but the babylonian army pursued them and overtook zedekiah in the plains of jericho they captured him and took him to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon at riblah in the land of hamath where he pronounced sentence on him there at riblah the king of babylon slaughtered the sons of zedekiah before his eyes and also killed all the nobles of judah then he put out zedekiahs eyes and bound him with bronze shackles to take him to babylon the babylonians set fire to the royal palace and the houses of the people and broke down the walls of jerusalem nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard carried into exile to babylon the people who remained in the city along with those who had gone over to him and the rest of the people but nebuzaradan the commander of the guard left behind in the land of judah some of the poor people who owned nothing and at that time he gave them vineyards and fields now nebuchadnezzar king of babylon had given these orders about jeremiah through nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard take him and look after him dont harm him but do for him whatever he asks so nebuzaradan the commander of the guard nebushazban a chief officer nergal sharezer a high official and all the other officers of the king of babylon sent and had jeremiah taken out of the courtyard of the guard they turned him over to gedaliah son of ahikam the son of shaphan to take him back to his home so he remained among his own people while jeremiah had been confined in the courtyard of the guard the word of the lord came to him go and tell ebed melech the cushite this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i am about to fulfill my words against this city through disaster not prosperity at that time they will be fulfilled before your eyes but i will rescue you on that day declares the lord you will not be handed over to those you fear i will save you you will not fall by the sword but will escape with your life because you trust in me declares the lord the word came to jeremiah from the lord after nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had released him at ramah he had found jeremiah bound in chains among all the captives from jerusalem and judah who were being carried into exile to babylon when the commander of the guard found jeremiah he said to him the lord your god decreed this disaster for this place and now the lord has brought it about he has done just as he said he would all this happened because you people sinned against the lord and did not obey him but today i am freeing you from the chains on your wrists come with me to babylon if you like and i will look after you but if you do not want to then dont come look the whole country lies before you go wherever you please however before jeremiah turned to go nebuzaradan added go back to gedaliah son of ahikam the son of shaphan whom the king of babylon has appointed over the towns of judah and live with him among the people or go anywhere else you please then the commander gave him provisions and a present and let him go so jeremiah went to gedaliah son of ahikam at mizpah and stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land when all the army officers and their men who were still in the open country heard that the king of babylon had appointed gedaliah son of ahikam as governor over the land and had put him in charge of the men women and children who were the poorest in the land and who had not been carried into exile to babylon they came to gedaliah at mizpah ishmael son of nethaniah johanan and jonathan the sons of kareah seraiah son of tanhumeth the sons of ephai the netophathite and jaazaniah the son of the maacathite and their men gedaliah son of ahikam the son of shaphan took an oath to reassure them and their men do not be afraid to serve the babylonians he said settle down in the land and serve the king of babylon and it will go well with you i myself will stay at mizpah to represent you before the babylonians who come to us but you are to harvest the wine summer fruit and oil and put them in your storage jars and live in the towns you have taken over when all the jews in moab ammon edom and all the other countries heard that the king of babylon had left a remnant in judah and had appointed gedaliah son of ahikam the son of shaphan as governor over them they all came back to the land of judah to gedaliah at mizpah from all the countries where they had been scattered and they harvested an abundance of wine and summer fruit johanan son of kareah and all the army officers still in the open country came to gedaliah at mizpah and said to him dont you know that baalis king of the ammonites has sent ishmael son of nethaniah to take your life but gedaliah son of ahikam did not believe them then johanan son of kareah said privately to gedaliah in mizpah let me go and kill ishmael son of nethaniah and no one will know it why should he take your life and cause all the jews who are gathered around you to be scattered and the remnant of judah to perish but gedaliah son of ahikam said to johanan son of kareah dont do such a thing what you are saying about ishmael is not true in the seventh month ishmael son of nethaniah the son of elishama who was of royal blood and had been one of the kings officers came with ten men to gedaliah son of ahikam at mizpah while they were eating together there ishmael son of nethaniah and the ten men who were with him got up and struck down gedaliah son of ahikam the son of shaphan with the sword killing the one whom the king of babylon had appointed as governor over the land ishmael also killed all the jews who were with gedaliah at mizpah as well as the babylonian soldiers who were there the day after gedaliahs assassination before anyone knew about it eighty men who had shaved off their beards torn their clothes and cut themselves came from shechem shiloh and samaria bringing grain offerings and incense with them to the house of the lord ishmael son of nethaniah went out from mizpah to meet them weeping as he went when he met them he said come to gedaliah son of ahikam when they went into the city ishmael son of nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern but ten of them said to ishmael dont kill us we have wheat and barley oil and honey hidden in a field so he let them alone and did not kill them with the others now the cistern where he threw all the bodies of the men he had killed along with gedaliah was the one king asa had made as part of his defense against baasha king of israel ishmael son of nethaniah filled it with the dead ishmael made captives of all the rest of the people who were in mizpah the kings daughters along with all the others who were left there over whom nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had appointed gedaliah son of ahikam ishmael son of nethaniah took them captive and set out to cross over to the ammonites when johanan son of kareah and all the army officers who were with him heard about all the crimes ishmael son of nethaniah had committed they took all their men and went to fight ishmael son of nethaniah they caught up with him near the great pool in gibeon when all the people ishmael had with him saw johanan son of kareah and the army officers who were with him they were glad all the people ishmael had taken captive at mizpah turned and went over to johanan son of kareah but ishmael son of nethaniah and eight of his men escaped from johanan and fled to the ammonites then johanan son of kareah and all the army officers who were with him led away all the survivors from mizpah whom he had recovered from ishmael son of nethaniah after he had assassinated gedaliah son of ahikam the soldiers women children and court officials he had brought from gibeon and they went on stopping at geruth kimham near bethlehem on their way to egypt to escape the babylonians they were afraid of them because ishmael son of nethaniah had killed gedaliah son of ahikam whom the king of babylon had appointed as governor over the land then all the army officers including johanan son of kareah and jezaniah son of hoshaiah and all the people from the least to the greatest approached jeremiah the prophet and said to him please hear our petition and pray to the lord your god for this entire remnant for as you now see though we were once many now only a few are left pray that the lord your god will tell us where we should go and what we should do i have heard you replied jeremiah the prophet i will certainly pray to the lord your god as you have requested i will tell you everything the lord says and will keep nothing back from you then they said to jeremiah may the lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not act in accordance with everything the lord your god sends you to tell us whether it is favorable or unfavorable we will obey the lord our god to whom we are sending you so that it will go well with us for we will obey the lord our god ten days later the word of the lord came to jeremiah so he called together johanan son of kareah and all the army officers who were with him and all the people from the least to the greatest he said to them this is what the lord the god of israel to whom you sent me to present your petition says if you stay in this land i will build you up and not tear you down i will plant you and not uproot you for i am grieved over the disaster i have inflicted on you do not be afraid of the king of babylon whom you now fear do not be afraid of him declares the lord for i am with you and will save you and deliver you from his hands i will show you compassion so that he will have compassion on you and restore you to your land however if you say we will not stay in this land and so disobey the lord your god and if you say no we will go and live in egypt where we will not see war or hear the trumpet or be hungry for bread then hear the word of the lord o remnant of judah this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says if you are determined to go to egypt and you do go to settle there then the sword you fear will overtake you there and the famine you dread will follow you into egypt and there you will die indeed all who are determined to go to egypt to settle there will die by the sword famine and plague not one of them will survive or escape the disaster i will bring on them this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says as my anger and wrath have been poured out on those who lived in jerusalem so will my wrath be poured out on you when you go to egypt you will be an object of cursing and horror of condemnation and reproach you will never see this place again o remnant of judah the lord has told you do not go to egypt be sure of this i warn you today that you made a fatal mistake when you sent me to the lord your god and said pray to the lord our god for us tell us everything he says and we will do it i have told you today but you still have not obeyed the lord your god in all he sent me to tell you so now be sure of this you will die by the sword famine and plague in the place where you want to go to settle when jeremiah finished telling the people all the words of the lord their god everything the lord had sent him to tell them azariah son of hoshaiah and johanan son of kareah and all the arrogant men said to jeremiah you are lying the lord our god has not sent you to say you must not go to egypt to settle there but baruch son of neriah is inciting you against us to hand us over to the babylonians so they may kill us or carry us into exile to babylon so johanan son of kareah and all the army officers and all the people disobeyed the lords command to stay in the land of judah instead johanan son of kareah and all the army officers led away all the remnant of judah who had come back to live in the land of judah from all the nations where they had been scattered they also led away all the men women and children and the kings daughters whom nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard had left with gedaliah son of ahikam the son of shaphan and jeremiah the prophet and baruch son of neriah so they entered egypt in disobedience to the lord and went as far as tahpanhes in tahpanhes the word of the lord came to jeremiah while the jews are watching take some large stones with you and bury them in clay in the brick pavement at the entrance to pharaohs palace in tahpanhes then say to them this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i will send for my servant nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and i will set his throne over these stones i have buried here he will spread his royal canopy above them he will come and attack egypt bringing death to those destined for death captivity to those destined for captivity and the sword to those destined for the sword he will set fire to the temples of the gods of egypt he will burn their temples and take their gods captive as a shepherd wraps his garment around him so will he wrap egypt around himself and depart from there unscathed there in the temple of the sun in egypt he will demolish the sacred pillars and will burn down the temples of the gods of egypt this word came to jeremiah concerning all the jews living in lower egypt in migdol tahpanhes and memphis and in upper egypt this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says you saw the great disaster i brought on jerusalem and on all the towns of judah today they lie deserted and in ruins because of the evil they have done they provoked me to anger by burning incense and by worshiping other gods that neither they nor you nor your fathers ever knew again and again i sent my servants the prophets who said do not do this detestable thing that i hate but they did not listen or pay attention they did not turn from their wickedness or stop burning incense to other gods therefore my fierce anger was poured out it raged against the towns of judah and the streets of jerusalem and made them the desolate ruins they are today now this is what the lord god almighty the god of israel says why bring such great disaster on yourselves by cutting off from judah the men and women the children and infants and so leave yourselves without a remnant why provoke me to anger with what your hands have made burning incense to other gods in egypt where you have come to live you will destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and reproach among all the nations on earth have you forgotten the wickedness committed by your fathers and by the kings and queens of judah and the wickedness committed by you and your wives in the land of judah and the streets of jerusalem to this day they have not humbled themselves or shown reverence nor have they followed my law and the decrees i set before you and your fathers therefore this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says i am determined to bring disaster on you and to destroy all judah i will take away the remnant of judah who were determined to go to egypt to settle there they will all perish in egypt they will fall by the sword or die from famine from the least to the greatest they will die by sword or famine they will become an object of cursing and horror of condemnation and reproach i will punish those who live in egypt with the sword famine and plague as i punished jerusalem none of the remnant of judah who have gone to live in egypt will escape or survive to return to the land of judah to which they long to return and live none will return except a few fugitives then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods along with all the women who were present a large assembly and all the people living in lower and upper egypt said to jeremiah we will not listen to the message you have spoken to us in the name of the lord we will certainly do everything we said we would we will burn incense to the queen of heaven and will pour out drink offerings to her just as we and our fathers our kings and our officials did in the towns of judah and in the streets of jerusalem at that time we had plenty of food and were well off and suffered no harm but ever since we stopped burning incense to the queen of heaven and pouring out drink offerings to her we have had nothing and have been perishing by sword and famine the women added when we burned incense to the queen of heaven and poured out drink offerings to her did not our husbands know that we were making cakes like her image and pouring out drink offerings to her then jeremiah said to all the people both men and women who were answering him did not the lord remember and think about the incense burned in the towns of judah and the streets of jerusalem by you and your fathers your kings and your officials and the people of the land when the lord could no longer endure your wicked actions and the detestable things you did your land became an object of cursing and a desolate waste without inhabitants as it is today because you have burned incense and have sinned against the lord and have not obeyed him or followed his law or his decrees or his stipulations this disaster has come upon you as you now see then jeremiah said to all the people including the women hear the word of the lord all you people of judah in egypt this is what the lord almighty the god of israel says you and your wives have shown by your actions what you promised when you said we will certainly carry out the vows we made to burn incense and pour out drink offerings to the queen of heavengo ahead then do what you promised keep your vows but hear the word of the lord all jews living in egypt i swear by my great name says the lord that no one from judah living anywhere in egypt will ever again invoke my name or swear as surely as the sovereign lord lives for i am watching over them for harm not for good the jews in egypt

her governors officers and warriors as well they will sleep forever and not awake declares the king whose name is the lord almighty this is what the lord almighty says babylons thick wall will be leveled and her high gates set on fire the peoples exhaust themselves for nothing the nations labor is only fuel for the flames this is the message jeremiah gave to the staff officer seraiah son of neriah the son of mahseiah when he went to babylon with zedekiah king of judah in the fourth year of his reign jeremiah had written on a scroll about all the disasters that would come upon babylon all that had been recorded concerning babylon he said to seraiah when you get to babylon see that you read all these words aloud then say o lord you have said you will destroy this place so that neither man nor animal will live in it it will be desolate forever when you finish reading this scroll tie a stone to it and throw it into the euphrates then say so will babylon sink to rise no more because of the disaster i will bring upon her and her people will fall the words of jeremiah end here zedekiah was twenty one years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem eleven years his mothers name was hamutal daughter of jeremiah she was from libnah he did evil in the eyes of the lord just as jehoiakim had done it was because of the lords anger that all this happened to jerusalem and judah and in the end he thrust them from his presence now zedekiah rebelled against the king of babylon so in the ninth year of zedekiahs reign on the tenth day of the tenth month nebuchadnezzar king of babylon marched against jerusalem with his whole army they camped outside the city and built siege works all around it the city was kept under siege until the eleventh year of king zedekiah by the ninth day of the fourth month the famine in the city had become so severe that there was no food for the people to eat then the city wall was broken through and the whole army fled they left the city at night through the gate between the two walls near the kings garden though the babylonians were surrounding the city they fled toward the arabah but the babylonian army pursued king zedekiah and overtook him in the plains of jericho all his soldiers were separated from him and scattered and he was captured he was taken to the king of babylon at riblah in the land of hamath where he pronounced sentence on him there at riblah the king of babylon slaughtered the sons of zedekiah before his eyes he also killed all the officials of judah then he put out zedekiahs eyes bound him with bronze shackles and took him to babylon where he put him in prison till the day of his death on the tenth day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of nebuchadnezzar king of babylon nebuzaradan commander of the imperial guard who served the king of babylon came to jerusalem he set fire to the temple of the lord the royal palace and all the houses of jerusalem every important building he burned down the whole babylonian army under the commander of the imperial guard broke down all the walls around jerusalem nebuzaradan the commander of the guard carried into exile some of the poorest people and those who remained in the city along with the rest of the craftsmen and those who had gone over to the king of babylon but nebuzaradan left behind the rest of the poorest people of the land to work the vineyards and fields the babylonians broke up the bronze pillars the movable stands and the bronze sea that were at the temple of the lord and they carried all the bronze to babylon they also took away the pots shovels wick trimmers sprinkling bowls dishes and all the bronze articles used in the temple service the commander of the imperial guard took away the basins censers sprinkling bowls pots lampstands dishes and bowls used for drink offerings all that were made of pure gold or silver the bronze from the two pillars the sea and the twelve bronze bulls under it and the movable stands which king solomon had made for the temple of the lord was more than could be weighed each of the pillars was eighteen cubits high and twelve cubits in circumference each was four fingers thick and hollow the bronze capital on top of the one pillar was five cubits high and was decorated with a network and pomegranates of bronze all around the other pillar with its pomegranates was similar there were ninety six pomegranates on the sides the total number of pomegranates above the surrounding network was a hundred the commander of the guard took as prisoners seraiah the chief priest zephaniah the priest next in rank and the three doorkeepers of those still in the city he took the officer in charge of the fighting men and seven royal advisers he also took the secretary who was chief officer in charge of conscripting the people of the land and sixty of his men who were found in the city nebuzaradan the commander took them all and brought them to the king of babylon at riblah there at riblah in the land of hamath the king had them executed so judah went into captivity away from her land this is the number of the people nebuchadnezzar carried into exile in the seventh year 3023 jews in nebuchadnezzars eighteenth year 832 people from jerusalem in his twenty third year 745 jews taken into exile by nebuzaradan the commander of the imperial guard there were 4600 people in all in the thirty seventh year of the exile of jehoiachin king of judah in the year evil merodach became king of babylon he released jehoiachin king of judah and freed him from prison on the twenty fifth day of the twelfth month he spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat of honor higher than those of the other kings who were with him in babylon so jehoiachin put aside his prison clothes and for the rest of his life ate regularly at the kings table day by day the king of babylon gave jehoiachin a regular allowance as long as he lived till the day of his death  how deserted lies the city once so full of

anger from on high he sent fire sent it down into my bones he spread a net for my feet and turned me back he made me desolate faint all the day long my sins have been bound into a yoke by his hands they were woven together they have come upon my neck and the lord has sapped my strength he has handed me over to those i cannot withstand the lord has rejected all the warriors in my midst he has summoned an army against me to crush my young men in his winepress the lord has trampled the virgin daughter of judah this is why i weep and my eyes overflow with tears no one is near to comfort me no

israel from heaven to earth he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger without pity the lord has swallowed up all the dwellings of jacob in his wrath he has torn down the strongholds of the daughter of judah he has brought her kingdom and its princes down to the ground in dishonor in fierce anger he has cut off every horn of israel he has withdrawn his right hand at the approach

feasts and her sabbaths in his fierce anger he has spurned both king and priest the lord has rejected his altar and abandoned his sanctuary he has handed over to the enemy the walls of her palaces they have raised a shout in the house of the lord as on the day of an appointed feast the lord determined to tear down the wall around the daughter of zion he stretched out a measuring line and did not withhold his hand from destroying he made ramparts and walls lament together they wasted away her gates have sunk into the ground their bars he has broken and destroyed her king and her princes are exiled among the nations the law is no more and her prophets no longer find visions from the lord the elders of the daughter of zion sit on the ground in silence they have sprinkled dust on their heads and put on sackcloth the young women of jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground my eyes fail from weeping i am in torment within my heart is poured out on the ground because my people are destroyed because children and infants faint in the streets of the city they say to their mothers where is bread and wine as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city as their lives ebb away in their mothers arms what can i say for you with what can i compare you o daughter of jerusalem to what can i liken you that i may comfort you o virgin daughter of zion your wound is as deep as the sea who can heal you the visions of your prophets were false and worthless they did not expose your sin to ward off your captivity the oracles they gave you were false and misleading all who pass your way clap their hands at you they scoff and shake their heads at the daughter of jerusalem is this the city that was called the perfection of beauty the joy of the whole earth all your enemies open their mouths wide against you they scoff and gnash their teeth and say we have swallowed her up this is the day we have waited for we have lived to see it the lord has done what he planned he has fulfilled his word which he decreed long ago he has overthrown you without pity he has let the enemy gloat over you he has exalted the horn of your foes the hearts of the people cry out to the lord o wall of the daughter of zion let your tears flow like a river day and night give yourself no relief your eyes no rest arise cry out in the night as the watches of the night begin pour out your heart like water in the presence of the lord lift up your hands to him for the lives of your children who faint from hunger at the head of every street look o lord and consider whom have you ever treated like this should women eat their offspring the children they have cared for should priest and prophet be killed in the sanctuary of the lord young and old lie together in the dust of the streets my young men and maidens have fallen by the sword you have slain them in the day of your anger you have slaughtered them without pity as you summon to a feast day so you summoned against me terrors on every side in the day of the lords anger no one escaped or survived those i cared for and reared my enemy has destroyed i am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath he has driven me away and made me walk in darkness rather than light indeed he has turned his hand against me again and again all day long he has made my skin and my flesh grow old and has broken my bones he has besieged me and surrounded me with bitterness and hardship he has made me dwell in darkness like those long dead he has walled me in so i cannot escape he has weighed me down with chains even when i call out or cry for help he shuts out my prayer he has barred my way with blocks of stone he has made my paths crooked like a bear lying in wait like a lion in hiding he dragged me from the path and mangled me and left me without help he drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows he pierced my heart with arrows from his quiver i became the laughingstock of all my people they mock me in song all day long he has filled me with bitter herbs and sated me with gall he has broken my teeth with gravel he has trampled me in the dust i have been deprived of peace i have forgotten what prosperity is so i say my splendor is gone and all that i had hoped from the lord i remember my affliction and my wandering the bitterness and the gall i well remember them and my soul is downcast within me yet this i call to mind and therefore i have hope because of the lords great love we are not consumed for his compassions never fail they are new every morning great is your faithfulness i say to myself the lord is my portion therefore i will wait for him the lord is good to those whose hope is in him to the one who seeks him it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the lord it is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young let him sit alone in silence for the lord has laid it on him let him bury his face in the dust there may yet be hope let him offer his cheek to one who would strike him and let him be filled with disgrace for men are not cast off by the lord forever though he brings grief he will show compassion so great is his unfailing love for he does not willingly bring affliction or grief to the children of men to crush underfoot all prisoners in the land to deny a man his rights before the most high to deprive a man of justice would not the lord see such things who can speak and have it happen if the lord has not decreed it is it not from the mouth of the most high that both calamities and good things come why should any living man complain when punished for his sins let us examine our ways and test them and let us return to the lord let us lift up our hearts and our hands to god in heaven and say we have sinned and rebelled and you have not forgiven you have covered yourself with anger and pursued us you have slain without pity you have covered yourself with a cloud so that no prayer can get through you have made us scum and refuse among the nations all our enemies have opened their mouths wide against us we have suffered terror and pitfalls ruin and destruction streams of tears flow from my eyes because my people are destroyed my eyes will flow unceasingly without relief until the lord looks down from heaven and sees what i see brings grief to my soul because of all the women of my city those who were my enemies without cause hunted me like a bird they tried to end my life in a pit and threw stones at me the waters closed over my head and i thought i was about to be cut off i called on your name o lord from the depths of the pit you heard my plea do not close your ears to my cry for relief you came near when i called you and you said do not fear o lord you took up my case you redeemed my life you have seen o lord the wrong done to me uphold my cause you have seen the depth of their vengeance all their plots against me o lord you have heard their insults all their plots against me what my enemies whisper and mutter against me all day long look at them sitting or standing they mock me in their songs pay them back what they deserve o lord for what their hands have done put a veil over their hearts and may your curse be on them pursue them in anger and destroy them from under the heavens of the lord how the gold has lost its luster the fine gold become dull the sacred gems are scattered at the head of every street how the precious sons of zion once worth their weight in gold are now considered as pots of clay the work of a potters hands even jackals offer their breasts to nurse their young but my people have become heartless like ostriches in the desert because of thirst the infants tongue sticks to the roof of its mouth the children beg for bread but no one gives it to them those who once ate delicacies are destitute in the streets those nurtured in purple now lie on ash heaps the punishment of my people is greater than that of sodom which was overthrown in a moment without a hand turned to help her their princes were brighter than snow and whiter than milk their bodies more ruddy than rubies their appearance like sapphires but now they are blacker than soot they are not recognized in the streets their skin has shriveled on their bones it has become as dry as a stick those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of famine racked with hunger they waste away for lack of food from the field with their own hands compassionate women have cooked their own children who became their food when my people were destroyed the lord has given full vent to his wrath he has poured out his fierce anger he kindled a fire in zion that consumed her foundations the kings of the earth did not believe nor did any of the worlds people that enemies and foes could enter the gates of jerusalem but it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests who shed within her the blood of the righteous now they grope through the streets like men who are blind they are so defiled with blood that no one dares to touch their garments go away you are unclean men cry to them away away dont touch us when they flee and wander about people among the nations say they can stay here no longer the lord himself has scattered them he no longer watches over them the priests are shown no honor the elders no favor moreover our eyes failed looking in vain for help from our towers we watched for a nation that could not save us men stalked us at every step so we could not walk in our streets our end was near our days were numbered for our end had come our pursuers were swifter than eagles in the sky they chased us over the mountains and lay in wait for us in the desert the lords anointed our very life breath was caught in their traps we thought that under his shadow we would live among the nations rejoice and be glad o daughter of edom you who live in the land of uz but to you also the cup will be passed you will be drunk and stripped naked o daughter of zion your punishment will end he will not prolong your exile but o daughter of edom he will punish your sin and expose your wickedness remember o lord what has happened to us look and see our disgrace our inheritance has been turned over to aliens our homes to foreigners we have become orphans and fatherless our mothers like widows we must buy the water we drink our wood can be had only at a price those who pursue us are at our heels we are weary and find no rest we submitted to egypt and assyria to get enough bread our fathers sinned and are no more and we bear their punishment slaves rule over us and there is none to free us from their hands we get our bread at the risk of our lives because of the sword in the desert our skin is hot as an oven feverish from hunger women have been ravished in zion and virgins in the towns of judah princes have been hung up by their hands elders are shown no respect young men toil at the millstones boys stagger under loads of wood the elders are gone from the city gate the young men have stopped their music joy is gone from our hearts our dancing has turned to mourning the crown has fallen from our head woe to us for we have sinned because of this our hearts are faint because of these things our eyes grow dim for mount zion which lies desolate with jackals prowling over it you o lord reign forever your throne endures from generation to generation why do you always forget us why do you forsake us so long restore us to yourself o lord that we may return renew our days as of old unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us beyond measure  in the thirtieth year in the fourth month on the fifth day while i was among the exiles by the kebar river the heavens were opened and i saw visions of god on the fifth of the month it was the fifth year of the exile of king jehoiachin the word of the lord came to ezekiel the priest the son of buzi by the kebar river in the land of the babylonians there the hand of the lord was upon him i looked and i saw a windstorm coming out of the north an immense cloud with flashing lightning and surrounded by brilliant light the center of the fire looked like glowing metal and in the fire was what looked like four living creatures in appearance their form was that of a man but each of them had four faces and four wings their legs were straight their feet were like those of a calf and gleamed like burnished bronze under their wings on their four sides they had the hands of a man all four of them had faces and wings and their wings touched one another each one went straight ahead they did not turn as they moved their faces looked like this each of the four had the face of a man and on the right side each had the face of a lion and on the left the face of an ox each also had the face of an eagle such were their faces their wings were spread out upward each had two wings one touching the wing of another creature on either side and two wings covering its body each one went straight ahead wherever the spirit would go they would go without turning as they went the appearance of the living creatures was like burning coals of fire or like torches fire moved back and forth among the creatures it was bright and lightning flashed out of it the creatures sped back and forth like flashes of lightning as i looked at the living creatures i saw a wheel on the ground beside each creature with its four faces this was the appearance and structure of the wheels they sparkled like chrysolite and all four looked alike each appeared to be made like a wheel intersecting a wheel as they moved they would go in any one of the four directions the creatures faced the wheels did not turn about as the creatures went their rims were high and awesome and all four rims were full of eyes all around when the living creatures moved the wheels beside them moved and when the living creatures rose from the ground the wheels also rose wherever the spirit would go they would go and the wheels would rise along with them because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels when the creatures moved they also moved when the creatures stood still they also stood still and when the creatures rose from the ground the wheels rose along with them because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels spread out above the heads of the living creatures was what looked like an expanse sparkling like ice and awesome under the expanse their wings were stretched out one toward the other and each had two wings covering its body when the creatures moved i heard the sound of their wings like the roar of rushing waters like the voice of the almighty like the tumult of an army when they stood still they lowered their wings then there came a voice from above the expanse over their heads as they stood with lowered wings above the expanse over their heads was what looked like a throne of sapphire and high above on the throne was a figure like that of a man i saw that from what appeared to be his waist up he looked like glowing metal as if full of fire and that from there down he looked like fire and brilliant light surrounded him like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day so was the radiance around him this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the lord when i saw it i fell facedown and i heard the voice of one speaking he said to me son of man stand up on your feet and i will speak to you as he spoke the spirit came into me and raised me to my feet and i heard him speaking to me he said son of man i am sending you to the israelites to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me they and their fathers have been in revolt against me to this very day the people to whom i am sending you are obstinate and stubborn say to them this is what the sovereign lord says and whether they listen or fail to listen for they are a rebellious house they will know that a prophet has been among them and you son of man do not be afraid of them or their words do not be afraid though briers and thorns are all around you and you live among scorpions do not be afraid of what they say or terrified by them though they are a rebellious house you must speak my words to them whether they listen or fail to listen for they are rebellious but you son of man listen to what i say to you do not rebel like that rebellious house open your mouth and eat what i give you then i looked and i saw a hand stretched out to me in it was a scroll which he unrolled before me on both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe and he said to me son of man eat what is before you eat this scroll then go and speak to the house of israel so i opened my mouth and he gave me the scroll to eat then he said to me son of man eat this scroll i am giving you and fill your stomach with it so i ate it and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth he then said to me son of man go now to the house of israel and speak my words to them you are not being sent to a people of obscure speech and difficult language but to the house of israel not to many peoples of obscure speech and difficult language whose words you cannot understand surely if i had sent you to them they would have listened to you but the house of israel is not willing to listen to you because they are not willing to listen to me for the whole house of israel is hardened and obstinate but i will make you as unyielding and hardened as they are i will make your forehead like the hardest stone harder than flint do not be afraid of them or terrified by them though they are a rebellious house and he said to me son of man listen carefully and take to heart all the words i speak to you go now to your countrymen in exile and speak to them say to them this is what the sovereign lord says whether they listen or fail to listen then the spirit lifted me up and i heard behind me a loud rumbling sound may the glory of the lord be praised in his dwelling place the sound of the wings of the living creatures brushing against each other and the sound of the wheels beside them a loud rumbling sound the spirit then lifted me up and took me away and i went in bitterness and in the anger of my spirit with the strong hand of the lord upon me i came to the exiles who lived at tel abib near the kebar river and there where they were living i sat among them for seven days overwhelmed at the end of seven days the word of the lord came to me son of man i have made you a watchman for the house of israel so hear the word i speak and give them warning from me when i say to a wicked man you will surely die and you do not warn him or speak out to dissuade him from his evil ways in order to save his life that wicked man will die for his sin and i will hold you accountable for his blood but if you do warn the wicked man and he does not turn from his wickedness or from his evil ways he will die for his sin but you will have saved yourself again when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil and i put a stumbling block before him he will die since you did not warn him he will die for his sin the righteous things he did will not be remembered and i will hold you accountable for his blood but if you do warn the righteous man not to sin and he does not sin he will surely live because he took warning and you will have saved yourself the hand of the lord was upon me there and he said to me get up and go out to the plain and there i will speak to you so i got up and went out to the plain and the glory of the lord was standing there like the glory i had seen by the kebar river and i fell facedown then the spirit came into me and raised me to my feet he spoke to me and said go shut yourself inside your house and you son of man they will tie with ropes you will be bound so that you cannot go out among the people i will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be silent and unable to rebuke them though they are a rebellious house but when i speak to you i will open your mouth and you shall say to them this is what the sovereign lord says whoever will listen let him listen and whoever will refuse let him refuse for they are a rebellious house now son of man take a clay tablet put it in front of you and draw the city of jerusalem on it then lay siege to it erect siege works against it build a ramp up to it set up camps against it and put battering rams around it then take an iron pan place it as an iron wall between you and the city and turn your face toward it it will be under siege and you shall besiege it this will be a sign to the house of israel then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of israel upon yourself you are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side i have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin so for 390 days you will bear the sin of the house of israel after you have finished this lie down again this time on your right side and bear the sin of the house of judah i have assigned you 40 days a day for each year turn your face toward the siege of jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her i will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege take wheat and barley beans and lentils millet and spelt put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself you are to eat it during the 390 days you lie on your side weigh out twenty shekels of food to eat each day and eat it at set times also measure out a sixth of a hin of water and drink it at set times eat the food as you would a barley cake bake it in the sight of the people using human excrement for fuel the lord said in this way the people of israel will eat defiled food among the nations where i will drive them then i said not so sovereign lord i have never defiled myself from my youth until now i have never eaten anything found dead or torn by wild animals no unclean meat has ever entered my mouth very well he said i will let you bake your bread over cow manure instead of human excrement he then said to me son of man i will cut off the supply of food in jerusalem the people will eat rationed food in anxiety and drink rationed water in despair for food and water will be scarce they will be appalled at the sight of each other and will waste away because of their sin now son of man take a sharp sword and use it as a barbers razor to shave your head and your beard then take a set of scales and divide up the hair when the days of your siege come to an end burn a third of the hair with fire inside the city take a third and strike it with the sword all around the city and scatter a third to the wind for i will pursue them with drawn sword but take a few strands of hair and tuck them away in the folds of your garment again take a few of these and throw them into the fire and burn them up a fire will spread from there to the whole house of israel this is what the sovereign lord says this is jerusalem which i have set in the center of the nations with countries all around her yet in her wickedness she has rebelled against my laws and decrees more than the nations and countries around her she has rejected my laws and has not followed my decrees therefore this is what the sovereign lord says you have been more unruly than the nations around you and have not followed my decrees or kept my laws you have not even conformed to the standards of the nations around you therefore this is what the sovereign lord says i myself am against you jerusalem and i will inflict punishment on you in the sight of the nations because of all your detestable idols i will do to you what i have never done before and will never do again therefore in your midst fathers will eat their children and children will eat their fathers i will inflict punishment on you and will scatter all your survivors to the winds therefore as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your vile images and detestable practices i myself will withdraw my favor i will not look on you with pity or spare you a third of your people will die of the plague or perish by famine inside you a third will fall by the sword outside your walls and a third i will scatter to the winds and pursue with drawn sword then my anger will cease and my wrath against them will subside and i will be avenged and when i have spent my wrath upon them they will know that i the lord have spoken in my zeal i will make you a ruin and a reproach among the nations around you in the sight of all who pass by you will be a reproach and a taunt a warning and an object of horror to the nations around you when i inflict punishment on you in anger and in wrath and with stinging rebuke i the lord have spoken when i shoot at you with my deadly and destructive arrows of famine i will shoot to destroy you i will bring more and more famine upon you and cut off your supply of food i will send famine and wild beasts against you and they will leave you childless plague and bloodshed will sweep through you and i will bring the sword against you i the lord have spoken the word of the lord came to me son of man set your face against the mountains of israel prophesy against them and say o mountains of israel hear the word of the sovereign lord this is what the sovereign lord says to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys i am about to bring a sword against you and i will destroy your high places your altars will be demolished and your incense altars will be smashed and i will slay your people in front of your idols i will lay the dead bodies of the israelites in front of their idols and i will scatter your bones around your altars wherever you live the towns will be laid waste and the high places demolished so that your altars will be laid waste and devastated your idols smashed and ruined your incense altars broken down and what you have made wiped out your people will fall slain among you and you will know that i am the lord but i will spare some for some of you will escape the sword when you are scattered among the lands and nations then in the nations where they have been carried captive those who escape will remember me how i have been grieved by their adulterous hearts which have turned away from me and by their eyes which have lusted after their idols they will loathe themselves for the evil they have done and for all their detestable practices and they will know that i am the lord i did not threaten in vain to bring this calamity on them this is what the sovereign lord says strike your hands together and stamp your feet and cry out alas because of all the wicked and detestable practices of the house of israel for they will fall by the sword famine and plague he that is far away will die of the plague and he that is near will fall by the sword and he that survives and is spared will die of famine so will i spend my wrath upon them and they will know that i am the lord when their people lie slain among their idols around their altars on every high hill and on all the mountaintops under every spreading tree and every leafy oak places where they offered fragrant incense to all their idols and i will stretch out my hand against them and make the land a desolate waste from the desert to diblah wherever they live then they will know that i am the lord the word of the lord came to me son of man this is what the sovereign lord says to the land of israel the end the end has come upon the four corners of the land the end is now upon you and i will unleash my anger against you i will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices i will not look on you with pity or spare you i will surely repay you for your conduct and the detestable practices among you then you will know that i am the lord this is what the sovereign lord says disaster an unheard of disaster is coming the end has come the end has come it has roused itself against you it has come doom has come upon you you who dwell in the land the time has come the day is near there is panic not joy upon the mountains i am about to pour out my wrath on you and spend my anger against you i will judge you according to your conduct and repay you for all your detestable practices i will not look on you with pity or spare you i will repay you in accordance with your conduct and the detestable practices among you then you will know that it is i the lord who strikes the blow the day is here it has come doom has burst forth the rod has budded arrogance has blossomed violence has grown into a rod to punish wickedness none of the people will be left none of that crowd no wealth nothing of value the time has come the day has arrived let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller grieve for wrath is upon the whole crowd the seller will not recover the land he has sold as long as both of them live for the vision concerning the whole crowd will not be reversed because of their sins not one of them will preserve his life though they blow the trumpet and get everything ready no one will go into battle for my wrath is upon the whole crowd outside is the sword inside are plague and famine those in the country will die by the sword and those in the city will be devoured by famine and plague all who survive and escape will be in the mountains moaning like doves of the valleys each because of his sins every hand will go limp and every knee will become as weak as water they will put on sackcloth and be clothed with terror their faces will be covered with shame and their heads will be shaved they will throw their silver into the streets and their gold will be an unclean thing their silver and gold will not be able to save them in the day of the lord s wrath they will not satisfy their hunger or fill their stomachs with it for it has made them stumble into sin they were proud of their beautiful jewelry and used it to make their detestable idols and vile images therefore i will turn these into an unclean thing for them i will hand it all over as plunder to foreigners and as loot to the wicked of the earth and they will defile it i will turn my face away from them and they will desecrate my treasured place robbers will enter it and desecrate it prepare chains because the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of violence i will bring the most wicked of the nations to take possession of their houses i will put an end to the pride of the mighty and their sanctuaries will be desecrated when terror comes they will seek peace but there will be none calamity upon calamity will come and rumor upon rumor they will try to get a vision from the prophet the teaching of the law by the priest will be lost as will the counsel of the elders the king will mourn the prince will be clothed with despair and the hands of the people of the land will tremble i will deal with them according to their conduct and by their own standards i will judge them then they will know that i am the lord in the sixth year in the sixth month on the fifth day while i was sitting in my house and the elders of judah were sitting before me the hand of the sovereign lord came upon me there i looked and i saw a figure like that of a man from what appeared to be his waist down he was like fire and from there up his appearance was as bright as glowing metal he stretched out what looked like a hand and took me by the hair of my head the spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and in visions of god he took me to jerusalem to the entrance to the north gate of the inner court where the idol that provokes to jealousy stood and there before me was the glory of the god of israel as in the vision i had seen in the plain then he said to me son of man look toward the north so i looked and in the entrance north of the gate of the altar i saw this idol of jealousy and he said to me son of man do you see what they are doing the utterly detestable things the house of israel is doing here things that will drive me far from my sanctuary but you will see things that are even more detestable then he brought me to the entrance to the court i looked and i saw a hole in the wall he said to me son of man now dig into the wall so i dug into the wall and saw a doorway there and he said to me go in and see the wicked and detestable things they are doing here so i went in and looked and i saw portrayed all over the walls all kinds of crawling things and detestable animals and all the idols of the house of israel in front of them stood seventy elders of the house of israel and jaazaniah son of shaphan was standing among them each had a censer in his hand and a fragrant cloud of incense was rising he said to me son of man have you seen what the elders of the house of israel are doing in the darkness each at the shrine of his own idol they say the lord does not see us the lord has forsaken the land again he said you will see them doing things that are even more detestable then he brought me to the entrance to the north gate of the house of the lord and i saw women sitting there mourning for tammuz he said to me do you see this son of man you will see things that are even more detestable than this he then brought me into the inner court of the house of the lord and there at the entrance to the temple between the portico and the altar were about twenty five men with their backs toward the temple of the lord and their faces toward the east they were bowing down to the sun in the east he said to me have you seen this son of man is it a trivial matter for the house of judah to do the detestable things they are doing here must they also fill the land with violence and continually provoke me to anger look at them putting the branch to their nose therefore i will deal with them in anger i will not look on them with pity or spare them although they shout in my ears i will not listen to them then i heard him call out in a loud voice bring the guards of the city here each with a weapon in his hand and i saw six men coming from the direction of the upper gate which faces north each with a deadly weapon in his hand with them was a man clothed in linen who had a writing kit at his side they came in and stood beside the bronze altar now the glory of the god of israel went up from above the cherubim where it had been and moved to the threshold of the temple then the lord called to the man clothed in linen who had the writing kit at his side and said to him go throughout the city of jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of those who grieve and lament over all the detestable things that are done in it as i listened he said to the others follow him through the city and kill without showing pity or compassion slaughter old men young men and maidens women and children but do not touch anyone who has the mark begin at my sanctuary so they began with the elders who were in front of the temple then he said to them defile the temple and fill the courts with the slain go so they went out and began killing throughout the city while they were killing and i was left alone i fell facedown crying out ah sovereign lord are you going to destroy the entire remnant of israel in this outpouring of your wrath on jerusalem he answered me the sin of the house of israel and judah is exceedingly great the land is full of bloodshed and the city is full of injustice they say the lord has forsaken the land the lord does not see so i will not look on them with pity or spare them but i will bring down on their own heads what they have done then the man in linen with the writing kit at his side brought back word saying i have done as you commanded i looked and i saw the likeness of a throne of sapphire above the expanse that was over the heads of the cherubim the lord said to the man clothed in linen go in among the wheels beneath the cherubim fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim and scatter them over the city and as i watched he went in now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the temple when the man went in and a cloud filled the inner court then the glory of the lord rose from above the cherubim and moved to the threshold of the temple the cloud filled the temple and the court was full of the radiance of the glory of the lord the sound of the wings of the cherubim could be heard as far away as the outer court like the voice of god almighty when he speaks when the lord commanded the man in linen take fire from among the wheels from among the cherubim the man went in and stood beside a wheel then one of the cherubim reached out his hand to the fire that was among them he took up some of it and put it into the hands of the man in linen who took it and went out under the wings of the cherubim could be seen what looked like the hands of a man i looked and i saw beside the cherubim four wheels one beside each of the cherubim the wheels sparkled like chrysolite as for their appearance the four of them looked alike each was like a wheel intersecting a wheel as they moved they would go in any one of the four directions the cherubim faced the wheels did not turn about as the cherubim went the cherubim went in whatever direction the head faced without turning as they went their entire bodies including their backs their hands and their wings were completely full of eyes as were their four wheels i heard the wheels being called the whirling wheels each of the cherubim had four faces one face was that of a cherub the second the face of a man the third the face of a lion and the fourth the face of an eagle then the cherubim rose upward these were the living creatures i had seen by the kebar river when the cherubim moved the wheels beside them moved and when the cherubim spread their wings to rise from the ground the wheels did not leave their side when the cherubim stood still they also stood still and when the cherubim rose they rose with them because the spirit of the living creatures was in them then the glory of the lord departed from over the threshold of the temple and stopped above the cherubim while i watched the cherubim spread their wings and rose from the ground and as they went the wheels went with them they stopped at the entrance to the east gate of the lord s house and the glory of the god of israel was above them these were the living creatures i had seen beneath the god of israel by the kebar river and i realized that they were cherubim each had four faces and four wings and under their wings was what looked like the hands of a man their faces had the same appearance as those i had seen by the kebar river each one went straight ahead then the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the gate of the house of the lord that faces east there at the entrance to the gate were twenty five men and i saw among them jaazaniah son of azzur and pelatiah son of benaiah leaders of the people the lord said to me son of man these are the men who are plotting evil and giving wicked advice in this city they say will it not soon be time to build houses this city is a cooking pot and we are the meat therefore prophesy against them prophesy son of man then the spirit of the lord came upon me and he told me to say this is what the lord says that is what you are saying o house of israel but i know what is going through your mind you have killed many people in this city and filled its streets with the dead therefore this is what the sovereign lord says the bodies you have thrown there are the meat and this city is the pot but i will drive you out of it you fear the sword and the sword is what i will bring against you declares the sovereign lord i will drive you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners and inflict punishment on you you will fall by the sword and i will execute judgment on you at the borders of israel then you will know that i am the lord this city will not be a pot for you nor will you be the meat in it i will execute judgment on you at the borders of israel and you will know that i am the lord for you have not followed my decrees or kept my laws but have conformed to the standards of the nations around you now as i was prophesying pelatiah son of benaiah died then i fell facedown and cried out in a loud voice ah sovereign lord will you completely destroy the remnant of israel the word of the lord came to me son of man your brothers your brothers who are your blood relatives and the whole house of israel are those of whom the people of jerusalem have said they are far away from the lord this land was given to us as our possession therefore say this is what the sovereign lord says although i sent them far away among the nations and scattered them among the countries yet for a little while i have been a sanctuary for them in the countries where they have gone therefore say this is what the sovereign lord says i will gather you from the nations and bring you back from the countries where you have been scattered and i will give you back the land of israel again they will return to it and remove all its vile images and detestable idols i will give them an undivided heart and put a new spirit in them i will remove from them their heart of stone and give them a heart of flesh then they will follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws they will be my people and i will be their god but as for those whose hearts are devoted to their vile images and detestable idols i will bring down on their own heads what they have done declares the sovereign lord then the cherubim with the wheels beside them spread their wings and the glory of the god of israel was above them the glory of the lord went up from within the city and stopped above the mountain east of it the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in babylonia in the vision given by the spirit of god then the vision i had seen went up from me and i told the exiles everything the lord had shown me the word of the lord came to me son of man you are living among a rebellious people they have eyes to see but do not see and ears to hear but do not hear for they are a rebellious people therefore son of man pack your belongings for exile and in the daytime as they watch set out and go from where you are to another place perhaps they will understand though they are a rebellious house during the daytime while they watch bring out your belongings packed for exile then in the evening while they are watching go out like those who go into exile while they watch dig through the wall and take your belongings out through it put them on your shoulder as they are watching and carry them out at dusk cover your face so that you cannot see the land for i have made you a sign to the house of israel so i did as i was commanded during the day i brought out my things packed for exile then in the evening i dug through the wall with my hands i took my belongings out at dusk carrying them on my shoulders while they watched in the morning the word of the lord came to me son of man did not that rebellious house of israel ask you what are you doing say to them this is what the sovereign lord says this oracle concerns the prince in jerusalem and the whole house of israel who are there say to them i am a sign to youas i have done so it will be done to them they will go into exile as captives the prince among them will put his things on his shoulder at dusk and leave and a hole will be dug in the wall for him to go through he will cover his face so that he cannot see the land i will spread my net for him and he will be caught in my snare i will bring him to babylonia the land of the chaldeans but he will not see it and there he will die i will scatter to the winds all those around him his staff and all his troops and i will pursue them with drawn sword they will know that i am the lord when i disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries but i will spare a few of them from the sword famine and plague so that in the nations where they go they may acknowledge all their detestable practices then they will know that i am the lord the word of the lord came to me son of man tremble as you eat your food and shudder in fear as you drink your water say to the people of the land this is what the sovereign lord says about those living in jerusalem and in the land of israel they will eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in despair for their land will be stripped of everything in it because of the violence of all who live there the inhabited towns will be laid waste and the land will be desolate then you will know that i am the lord the word of the lord came to me son of man what is this proverb you have in the land of israel the days go by and every vision comes to nothing say to them this is what the sovereign lord says i am going to put an end to this proverb and they will no longer quote it in israel say to them the days are near when every vision will be fulfilled for there will be no more false visions or flattering divinations among the people of israel but i the lord will speak what i will and it shall be fulfilled without delay for in your days you rebellious house i will fulfill whatever i say declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man the house of israel is saying the vision he sees is for many years from now and he prophesies about the distant future therefore say to them this is what the sovereign lord says none of my words will be delayed any longer whatever i say will be fulfilled declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man prophesy against the prophets of israel who are now prophesying say to those who prophesy out of their own imagination hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says woe to the foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and have seen nothing your prophets o israel are like jackals among ruins you have not gone up to the breaks in the wall to repair it for the house of israel so that it will stand firm in the battle on the day of the lord their visions are false and their divinations a lie they say the lord declares when the lord has not sent them yet they expect their words to be fulfilled have you not seen false visions and uttered lying divinations when you say the lord declares though i have not spoken therefore this is what the sovereign lord says because of your false words and lying visions i am against you declares the sovereign lord my hand will be against the prophets who see false visions and utter lying divinations they will not belong to the council of my people or be listed in the records of the house of israel nor will they enter the land of israel then you will know that i am the sovereign lord because they lead my people astray saying peace when there is no peace and because when a flimsy wall is built they cover it with whitewash therefore tell those who cover it with whitewash that it is going to fall rain will come in torrents and i will send hailstones hurtling down and violent winds will burst forth when the wall collapses will people not ask you where is the whitewash you covered it with therefore this is what the sovereign lord says in my wrath i will unleash a violent wind and in my anger hailstones and torrents of rain will fall with destructive fury i will tear down the wall you have covered with whitewash and will level it to the ground so that its foundation will be laid bare when it falls you will be destroyed in it and you will know that i am the lord so i will spend my wrath against the wall and against those who covered it with whitewash i will say to you the wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it those prophets of israel who prophesied to jerusalem and saw visions of peace for her when there was no peace declares the sovereign lord now son of man set your face against the daughters of your people who prophesy out of their own imagination prophesy against them and say this is what the sovereign lord says woe to the women who sew magic charms on all their wrists and make veils of various lengths for their heads in order to ensnare people will you ensnare the lives of my people but preserve your own you have profaned me among my people for a few handfuls of barley and scraps of bread by lying to my people who listen to lies you have killed those who should not have died and have spared those who should not live therefore this is what the sovereign lord says i am against your magic charms with which you ensnare people like birds and i will tear them from your arms i will set free the people that you ensnare like birds i will tear off your veils and save my people from your hands and they will no longer fall prey to your power then you will know that i am the lord because you disheartened the righteous with your lies when i had brought them no grief and because you encouraged the wicked not to turn from their evil ways and so save their lives therefore you will no longer see false visions or practice divination i will save my people from your hands and then you will know that i am the lord some of the elders of israel came to me and sat down in front of me then the word of the lord came to me son of man these men have set up idols in their hearts and put wicked stumbling blocks before their faces should i let them inquire of me at all therefore speak to them and tell them this is what the sovereign lord says when any israelite sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face and then goes to a prophet i the lord will answer him myself in keeping with his great idolatry i will do this to recapture the hearts of the people of israel who have all deserted me for their idols therefore say to the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord says repent turn from your idols and renounce all your detestable practices when any israelite or any alien living in israel separates himself from me and sets up idols in his heart and puts a wicked stumbling block before his face and then goes to a prophet to inquire of me i the lord will answer him myself i will set my face against that man and make him an example and a byword i will cut him off from my people then you will know that i am the lord and if the prophet is enticed to utter a prophecy i the lord have enticed that prophet and i will stretch out my hand against him and destroy him from among my people israel they will bear their guilt the prophet will be as guilty as the one who consults him then the people of israel will no longer stray from me nor will they defile themselves anymore with all their sins they will be my people and i will be their god declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man if a country sins against me by being unfaithful and i stretch out my hand against it to cut off its food supply and send famine upon it and kill its men and their animals even if these three men noah daniel and job were in it they could save only themselves by their righteousness declares the sovereign lord or if i send wild beasts through that country and they leave it childless and it becomes desolate so that no one can pass through it because of the beasts as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord even if these three men were in it they could not save their own sons or daughters they alone would be saved but the land would be desolate or if i bring a sword against that country and say let the sword pass throughout the land and i kill its men and their animals as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord even if these three men were in it they could not save their own sons or daughters they alone would be saved or if i send a plague into that land and pour out my wrath upon it through bloodshed killing its men and their animals as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord even if noah daniel and job were in it they could save neither son nor daughter they would save only themselves by their righteousness for this is what the sovereign lord says how much worse will it be when i send against jerusalem my four dreadful judgments sword and famine and wild beasts and plague to kill its men and their animals yet there will be some survivors sons and daughters who will be brought out of it they will come to you and when you see their conduct and their actions you will be consoled regarding the disaster i have brought upon jerusalem every disaster i have brought upon it you will be consoled when you see their conduct and their actions for you will know that i have done nothing in it without cause declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man how is the wood of a vine better than that of a branch on any of the trees in the forest is wood ever taken from it to make anything useful do they make pegs from it to hang things on and after it is thrown on the fire as fuel and the fire burns both ends and chars the middle is it then useful for anything if it was not useful for anything when it was whole how much less can it be made into something useful when the fire has burned it and it is charred therefore this is what the sovereign lord says as i have given the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest as fuel for the fire so will i treat the people living in jerusalem i will set my face against them although they have come out of the fire the fire will yet consume them and when i set my face against them you will know that i am the lord i will make the land desolate because they have been unfaithful declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man confront jerusalem with her detestable practices and say this is what the sovereign lord says to jerusalem your ancestry and birth were in the land of the canaanites your father was an amorite and your mother a hittite on the day you were born your cord was not cut nor were you washed with water to make you clean nor were you rubbed with salt or wrapped in cloths no one looked on you with pity or had compassion enough to do any of these things for you rather you were thrown out into the open field for on the day you were born you were despised then i passed by and saw you kicking about in your blood and as you lay there in your blood i said to you live i made you grow like a plant of the field you grew up and developed and became the most beautiful of jewels your breasts were formed and your hair grew you who were naked and bare later i passed by and when i looked at you and saw that you were old enough for love i spread the corner of my garment over you and covered your nakedness i gave you my solemn oath and entered into a covenant with you declares the sovereign lord and you became mine i bathed you with water and washed the blood from you and put ointments on you i clothed you with an embroidered dress and put leather sandals on you i dressed you in fine linen and covered you with costly garments i adorned you with jewelry i put bracelets on your arms and a necklace around your neck and i put a ring on your nose earrings on your ears and a beautiful crown on your head so you were adorned with gold and silver your clothes were of fine linen and costly fabric and embroidered cloth your food was fine flour honey and olive oil you became very beautiful and rose to be a queen and your fame spread among the nations on account of your beauty because the splendor i had given you made your beauty perfect declares the sovereign lord but you trusted in your beauty and used your fame to become a prostitute you lavished your favors on anyone who passed by and your beauty became his you took some of your garments to make gaudy high places where you carried on your prostitution such things should not happen nor should they ever occur you also took the fine jewelry i gave you the jewelry made of my gold and silver and you made for yourself male idols and engaged in prostitution with them and you took your embroidered clothes to put on them and you offered my oil and incense before them also the food i provided for you the fine flour olive oil and honey i gave you to eat you offered as fragrant incense before them that is what happened declares the sovereign lord and you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them as food to the idols was your prostitution not enough you slaughtered my children and sacrificed them to the idols in all your detestable practices and your prostitution you did not remember the days of your youth when you were naked and bare kicking about in your blood woe woe to you declares the sovereign lord in addition to all your other wickedness you built a mound for yourself and made a lofty shrine in every public square at the head of every street you built your lofty shrines and degraded your beauty offering your body with increasing promiscuity to anyone who passed by you engaged in prostitution with the egyptians your lustful neighbors and provoked me to anger with your increasing promiscuity so i stretched out my hand against you and reduced your territory i gave you over to the greed of your enemies the daughters of the philistines who were shocked by your lewd conduct you engaged in prostitution with the assyrians too because you were insatiable and even after that you still were not satisfied then you increased your promiscuity to include babylonia a land of merchants but even with this you were not satisfied how weak willed you are declares the sovereign lord when you do all these things acting like a brazen prostitute when you built your mounds at the head of every street and made your lofty shrines in every public square you were unlike a prostitute because you scorned payment you adulterous wife you prefer strangers to your own husband every prostitute receives a fee but you give gifts to all your lovers bribing them to come to you from everywhere for your illicit favors so in your prostitution you are the opposite of others no one runs after you for your favors you are the very opposite for you give payment and none is given to you therefore you prostitute hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says because you poured out your wealth and exposed your nakedness in your promiscuity with your lovers and because of all your detestable idols and because you gave them your childrens blood therefore i am going to gather all your lovers with whom you found pleasure those you loved as well as those you hated i will gather them against you from all around and will strip you in front of them and they will see all your nakedness i will sentence you to the punishment of women who commit adultery and who shed blood i will bring upon you the blood vengeance of my wrath and jealous anger then i will hand you over to your lovers and they will tear down your mounds and destroy your lofty shrines they will strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry and leave you naked and bare they will bring a mob against you who will stone you and hack you to pieces with their swords they will burn down your houses and inflict punishment on you in the sight of many women i will put a stop to your prostitution and you will no longer pay your lovers then my wrath against you will subside and my jealous anger will turn away from you i will be calm and no longer angry because you did not remember the days of your youth but enraged me with all these things i will surely bring down on your head what you have done declares the sovereign lord did you not add lewdness to all your other detestable practices everyone who quotes proverbs will quote this proverb about you like mother like daughter you are a true daughter of your mother who despised her husband and her children and you are a true sister of your sisters who despised their husbands and their children your mother was a hittite and your father an amorite your older sister was samaria who lived to the north of you with her daughters and your younger sister who lived to the south of you with her daughters was sodom you not only walked in their ways and copied their detestable practices but in all your ways you soon became more depraved than they as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord your sister sodom and her daughters never did what you and your daughters have done now this was the sin of your sister sodom she and her daughters were arrogant overfed and unconcerned they did not help the poor and needy they were haughty and did detestable things before me therefore i did away with them as you have seen samaria did not commit half the sins you did you have done more detestable things than they and have made your sisters seem righteous by all these things you have done bear your disgrace for you have furnished some justification for your sisters because your sins were more vile than theirs they appear more righteous than you so then be ashamed and bear your disgrace for you have made your sisters appear righteous however i will restore the fortunes of sodom and her daughters and of samaria and her daughters and your fortunes along with them so that you may bear your disgrace and be ashamed of all you have done in giving them comfort and your sisters sodom with her daughters and samaria with her daughters will return to what they were before and you and your daughters will return to what you were before you would not even mention your sister sodom in the day of your pride before your wickedness was uncovered even so you are now scorned by the daughters of edom and all her neighbors and the daughters of the philistines all those around you who despise you you will bear the consequences of your lewdness and your detestable practices declares the lord this is what the sovereign lord says i will deal with you as you deserve because you have despised my oath by breaking the covenant yet i will remember the covenant i made with you in the days of your youth and i will establish an everlasting covenant with you then you will remember your ways and be ashamed when you receive your sisters both those who are older than you and those who are younger i will give them to you as daughters but not on the basis of my covenant with you so i will establish my covenant with you and you will know that i am the lord then when i make atonement for you for all you have done you will remember and be ashamed and never again open your mouth because of your humiliation declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man set forth an allegory and tell the house of israel a parable say to them this is what the sovereign lord says a great eagle with powerful wings long feathers and full plumage of varied colors came to lebanon taking hold of the top of a cedar he broke off its topmost shoot and carried it away to a land of merchants where he planted it in a city of traders he took some of the seed of your land and put it in fertile soil he planted it like a willow by abundant water and it sprouted and became a low spreading vine its branches turned toward him but its roots remained under it so it became a vine and produced branches and put out leafy boughs but there was another great eagle with powerful wings and full plumage the vine now sent out its roots toward him from the plot where it was planted and stretched out its branches to him for water it had been planted in good soil by abundant water so that it would produce branches bear fruit and become a splendid vine say to them this is what the sovereign lord says will it thrive will it not be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers all its new growth will wither it will not take a strong arm or many people to pull it up by the roots even if it is transplanted will it thrive will it not wither completely when the east wind strikes it wither away in the plot where it grew then the word of the lord came to me say to this rebellious house do you not know what these things mean say to them the king of babylon went to jerusalem and carried off her king and her nobles bringing them back with him to babylon then he took a member of the royal family and made a treaty with him putting him under oath he also carried away the leading men of the land so that the kingdom would be brought low unable to rise again surviving only by keeping his treaty but the king rebelled against him by sending his envoys to egypt to get horses and a large army will he succeed will he who does such things escape will he break the treaty and yet escape as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord he shall die in babylon in the land of the king who put him on the throne whose oath he despised and whose treaty he broke pharaoh with his mighty army and great horde will be of no help to him in war when ramps are built and siege works erected to destroy many lives he despised the oath by breaking the covenant because he had given his hand in pledge and yet did all these things he shall not escape therefore this is what the sovereign lord says as surely as i live i will bring down on his head my oath that he despised and my covenant that he broke i will spread my net for him and he will be caught in my snare i will bring him to babylon and execute judgment upon him there because he was unfaithful to me all his fleeing troops will fall by the sword and the survivors will be scattered to the winds then you will know that i the lord have spoken this is what the sovereign lord says i myself will take a shoot from the very top of a cedar and plant it i will break off a tender sprig from its topmost shoots and plant it on a high and lofty mountain on the mountain heights of israel i will plant it it will produce branches and bear fruit and become a splendid cedar birds of every kind will nest in it they will find shelter in the shade of its branches all the trees of the field will know that i the lord bring down the tall tree and make the low tree grow tall i dry up the green tree and make the dry tree flourish i the lord have spoken and i will do it the word of the lord came to me what do you people mean by quoting this proverb about the land of israel the fathers eat sour grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord you will no longer quote this proverb in israel for every living soul belongs to me the father as well as the son both alike belong to me the soul who sins is the one who will die suppose there is a righteous man who does what is just and right he does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of israel he does not defile his neighbors wife or lie with a woman during her period he does not oppress anyone but returns what he took in pledge for a loan he does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked he does not lend at usury or take excessive interest he withholds his hand from doing wrong and judges fairly between man and man he follows my decrees and faithfully keeps my laws that man is righteous he will surely live declares the sovereign lord suppose he has a violent son who sheds blood or does any of these other things though the father has done none of them he eats at the mountain shrines he defiles his neighbors wife he oppresses the poor and needy he commits robbery he does not return what he took in pledge he looks to the idols he does detestable things he lends at usury and takes excessive interest will such a man live he will not because he has done all these detestable things he will surely be put to death and his blood will be on his own head but suppose this son has a son who sees all the sins his father commits and though he sees them he does not do such things he does not eat at the mountain shrines or look to the idols of the house of israel he does not defile his neighbors wife he does not oppress anyone or require a pledge for a loan he does not commit robbery but gives his food to the hungry and provides clothing for the naked he withholds his hand from sin and takes no usury or excessive interest he keeps my laws and follows my decrees he will not die for his fathers sin he will surely live but his father will die for his own sin because he practiced extortion robbed his brother and did what was wrong among his people yet you ask why does the son not share the guilt of his father since the son has done what is just and right and has been careful to keep all my decrees he will surely live the soul who sins is the one who will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him but if a wicked man turns away from all the sins he has committed and keeps all my decrees and does what is just and right he will surely live he will not die none of the offenses he has committed will be remembered against him because of the righteous things he has done he will live do i take any pleasure in the death of the wicked declares the sovereign lord rather am i not pleased when they turn from their ways and live but if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and does the same detestable things the wicked man does will he live none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered because of the unfaithfulness he is guilty of and because of the sins he has committed he will die yet you say the way of the lord is not just hear o house of israel is my way unjust is it not your ways that are unjust if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin he will die for it because of the sin he has committed he will die but if a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is just and right he will save his life because he considers all the offenses he has committed and turns away from them he will surely live he will not die yet the house of israel says the way of the lord is not just are my ways unjust o house of israel is it not your ways that are unjust therefore o house of israel i will judge you each one according to his ways declares the sovereign lord repent turn away from all your offenses then sin will not be your downfall rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committed and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live take up a lament concerning the princes of israel and say what a lioness was your mother among the lions she lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs she brought up one of her cubs and he became a strong lion he learned to tear the prey and he devoured men the nations heard about him and he was trapped in their pit they led him with hooks to the land of egypt when she saw her hope unfulfilled her expectation gone she took another of her cubs and made him a strong lion he prowled among the lions for he was now a strong lion he learned to tear the prey and he devoured men he broke down their strongholds and devastated their towns the land and all who were in it were terrified by his roaring then the nations came against him those from regions round about they spread their net for him and he was trapped in their pit with hooks they pulled him into a cage and brought him to the king of babylon they put him in prison so his roar was heard no longer on the mountains of israel your mother was like a vine in your vineyard planted by the water it was fruitful and full of branches because of abundant water its branches were strong fit for a rulers scepter it towered high above the thick foliage conspicuous for its height and for its many branches but it was uprooted in fury and thrown to the ground the east wind made it shrivel it was stripped of its fruit its strong branches withered and fire consumed them now it is planted in the desert in a dry and thirsty land fire spread from one of its main branches and consumed its fruit no strong branch is left on it fit for a rulers scepter this is a lament and is to be used as a lament in the seventh year in the fifth month on the tenth day some of the elders of israel came to inquire of the lord and they sat down in front of me then the word of the lord came to me son of man speak to the elders of israel and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says have you come to inquire of me as surely as i live i will not let you inquire of me declares the sovereign lord will you judge them will you judge them son of man then confront them with the detestable practices of their fathers and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says on the day i chose israel i swore with uplifted hand to the descendants of the house of jacob and revealed myself to them in egypt with uplifted hand i said to them i am the lord your god on that day i swore to them that i would bring them out of egypt into a land i had searched out for them a land flowing with milk and honey the most beautiful of all lands and i said to them each of you get rid of the vile images you have set your eyes on and do not defile yourselves with the idols of egypt i am the lord your god but they rebelled against me and would not listen to me they did not get rid of the vile images they had set their eyes on nor did they forsake the idols of egypt so i said i would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in egypt but for the sake of my name i did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations they lived among and in whose sight i had revealed myself to the israelites by bringing them out of egypt therefore i led them out of egypt and brought them into the desert i gave them my decrees and made known to them my laws for the man who obeys them will live by them also i gave them my sabbaths as a sign between us so they would know that i the lord made them holy yet the people of israel rebelled against me in the desert they did not follow my decrees but rejected my laws although the man who obeys them will live by them and they utterly desecrated my sabbaths so i said i would pour out my wrath on them and destroy them in the desert but for the sake of my name i did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight i had brought them out also with uplifted hand i swore to them in the desert that i would not bring them into the land i had given them a land flowing with milk and honey most beautiful of all lands because they rejected my laws and did not follow my decrees and desecrated my sabbaths for their hearts were devoted to their idols yet i looked on them with pity and did not destroy them or put an end to them in the desert i said to their children in the desert do not follow the statutes of your fathers or keep their laws or defile yourselves with their idols i am the lord your god follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws keep my sabbaths holy that they may be a sign between us then you will know that i am the lord your god but the children rebelled against me they did not follow my decrees they were not careful to keep my laws although the man who obeys them will live by them and they desecrated my sabbaths so i said i would pour out my wrath on them and spend my anger against them in the desert but i withheld my hand and for the sake of my name i did what would keep it from being profaned in the eyes of the nations in whose sight i had brought them out also with uplifted hand i swore to them in the desert that i would disperse them among the nations and scatter them through the countries because they had not obeyed my laws but had rejected my decrees and desecrated my sabbaths and their eyes lusted after their fathers idols i also gave them over to statutes that were not good and laws they could not live by i let them become defiled through their gifts the sacrifice of every firstborn that i might fill them with horror so they would know that i am the lord therefore son of man speak to the people of israel and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says in this also your fathers blasphemed me by forsaking me when i brought them into the land i had sworn to give them and they saw any high hill or any leafy tree there they offered their sacrifices made offerings that provoked me to anger presented their fragrant incense and poured out their drink offerings then i said to them what is this high place you go to it is called bamah to this day therefore say to the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord says will you defile yourselves the way your fathers did and lust after their vile images when you offer your gifts the sacrifice of your sons in the fire you continue to defile yourselves with all your idols to this day am i to let you inquire of me o house of israel as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord i will not let you inquire of me you say we want to be like the nations like the peoples of the world who serve wood and stone but what you have in mind will never happen as surely as i live declares

scattered with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with outpoured wrath i will bring you into the desert of the nations and there face to face i will execute judgment upon you as i judged your fathers in the desert of the land of egypt so i will judge you declares the sovereign lord i will take note of you as you pass under my rod and i will bring you into the bond of the covenant i will purge you of those who revolt and rebel against me although i will bring them out of the land where they are living yet they will not enter the land of israel then you will know that i am the lord as for you o house of israel this is what the sovereign lord says go and serve your idols every one of you but afterward you will surely listen to me and no longer profane my holy name with your gifts and idols for on my holy mountain the high mountain of israel declares the sovereign lord there in the land the entire house of israel will serve me and there i will accept them there i will require your offerings and your choice gifts along with all your holy sacrifices i will accept you as fragrant incense when i bring you out from the nations and gather you from the countries where you have been scattered and i will show myself holy among you in the sight of the nations then you will know that i am the lord when i bring you into the land of israel the land i had sworn with uplifted hand to give to your fathers there you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done you will know that i

country make a signpost where the road branches off to the city mark out one road for the sword to come against rabbah of the ammonites and another against judah and fortified jerusalem for the king of babylon will stop at the fork in the road at the junction of the two roads to seek an omen he will cast lots with arrows he will consult his idols he will examine the liver into his right hand will come the lot for jerusalem where he is to set up battering rams to give the command to slaughter to sound the battle cry to set battering rams against the gates to build a ramp and to erect siege works it will seem like a false omen to those who have sworn allegiance to him but he will remind them of their guilt and take them captive therefore this is what the sovereign lord says because you

midst and defiles herself by making idols you have become guilty because of the blood you have shed and have become defiled by the idols you have made you have brought your days to a close and the end of your years has come therefore i will make you an object of scorn to the nations and a laughingstock to all the countries those who are near and those who are far away will mock you o infamous city

mistreated the fatherless and the widow you have despised my holy things and desecrated my sabbaths in you are slanderous men bent on shedding blood in you are those who eat at the mountain shrines and commit lewd acts in you are those who dishonor their fathers bed in you are those who violate women during their period when they are ceremonially unclean in you one man commits a detestable offense with his neighbors wife another shamefully defiles his daughter in law and another violates his sister his own fathers daughter in you men accept bribes to shed blood you take usury and excessive interest and make unjust gain from your neighbors by extortion and you have forgotten me declares the sovereign lord i will surely strike my hands together at the unjust gain you have made and at the blood you have shed in your midst will your courage endure or your hands be strong in the day i deal with you i the lord have spoken and i will do it i will disperse you among the nations and scatter you through the countries and i will put an end to your uncleanness when you have been defiled in the eyes of the nations you will know that i am the lord then the word of the lord came to me son of man the house of israel has become dross to me all of them are the copper tin iron and lead left inside a furnace they are but the dross of silver therefore this is what the sovereign lord says because you have all become dross i will gather you into jerusalem as men gather silver copper iron lead and tin into a furnace to melt it with a fiery blast so will i gather you in my anger and my wrath and put you inside the city and melt you i will gather you and i will blow on you with my fiery wrath and you will be melted inside her as silver is melted in a furnace so you will be melted inside her and you will know that i the lord have poured out my wrath upon you again the word of the lord came to me son of man say to the land you are a land that has had no rain or showers in the day of wrath there is a conspiracy of her princes within her like a roaring lion tearing its prey they devour people take treasures and precious things and make many widows within her her priests do violence to my law and profane my holy things they do not distinguish between the holy and the common they teach that there is no difference between the unclean and the clean and they shut their eyes to the keeping of my sabbaths so that i am profaned among them her officials within her are like wolves tearing their prey they shed blood and kill people to make unjust gain her prophets whitewash these deeds for them by false visions and lying divinations they say this is what the sovereign lord says when the lord has not spoken the people of the land practice extortion and commit robbery they oppress the poor and needy and mistreat the alien denying them justice i looked for a man among them who would build up the wall and stand before me in the gap on behalf of the land so i would not have to destroy it but i found none so i will pour out my wrath on them and consume them with my fiery anger bringing down on their own heads all they have done declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man there were two women daughters of the same mother they became prostitutes in egypt engaging in prostitution from their youth in that land their breasts were fondled and their virgin bosoms caressed the older was named oholah and her sister was oholibah they were mine and gave birth to sons and daughters oholah is samaria and oholibah is jerusalem oholah engaged in prostitution while she was still mine and she lusted after her lovers the assyrians warriors clothed in blue governors and commanders all of them handsome young men and mounted horsemen she gave herself as a prostitute to all the elite of the assyrians and defiled herself with all the idols of everyone she lusted after she did not give up the prostitution she began in egypt when during her youth men slept with her caressed her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her therefore i handed her over to her lovers the assyrians for whom she lusted they stripped her naked took away her sons and daughters and killed her with the sword she became a byword among women and punishment was inflicted on her her sister oholibah saw this yet in her lust and prostitution she was more depraved than her sister she too lusted after the assyrians governors and commanders warriors in full dress mounted horsemen all handsome young men i saw that she too defiled herself both of them went the same way but she carried her prostitution still further she saw men portrayed on a wall figures of chaldeans portrayed in red with belts around their waists and flowing turbans on their heads all of them looked like babylonian chariot officers natives of chaldea as soon as she saw them she lusted after them and sent messengers to them in chaldea then the babylonians came to her to the bed of love and in their lust they defiled her after she had been defiled by them she turned away from them in disgust when she carried on her prostitution openly and exposed her nakedness i turned away from her in disgust just as i had turned away from her sister yet she became more and more promiscuous as she recalled the days of her youth when she was a prostitute in egypt there she lusted after her lovers whose genitals were like those of donkeys and whose emission was like that of horses so you longed for the lewdness of your youth when in egypt your bosom was caressed and your young breasts fondled therefore oholibah this is what the sovereign lord says i will stir up your lovers against you those you turned away from in disgust and i will bring them against you from every side the babylonians and all the chaldeans the men of pekod and shoa and koa and all the assyrians with them handsome young men all of them governors and commanders chariot officers and men of high rank all mounted on horses they will come against you with weapons chariots and wagons and with a throng of people they will take up positions against you on every side with large and small shields and with helmets i will turn you over to them for punishment and they will punish you according to their standards i will direct my jealous anger against you and they will deal with you in fury they will cut off your noses and your ears and those of you who are left will fall by the sword they will take away your sons and daughters and those of you who are left will be consumed by fire they will also strip you of your clothes and take your fine jewelry so i will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you began in egypt you will not look on these things with longing or remember egypt anymore for this is what the sovereign lord says i am about to hand you over to those you hate to those you turned away from in disgust they will deal with you in hatred and take away everything you have worked for they will leave you naked and bare and the shame of your prostitution will be exposed your lewdness and promiscuity have brought this upon you because you lusted after the nations and defiled yourself with their idols you have gone the way of your sister so i will put her cup into your hand this is what the sovereign lord says you will drink your sisters cup a cup large and deep it will bring scorn and derision for it holds so much you will be filled with drunkenness and sorrow the cup of ruin and desolation the cup of your sister samaria you will drink it and drain it dry you will dash it to pieces and tear your breasts i have spoken declares the sovereign lord therefore this is what the sovereign lord says since you have forgotten me and thrust me behind your back you must bear the consequences of your lewdness and prostitution the lord said to me son of man will you judge oholah and oholibah then confront them with their detestable practices for they have committed adultery and blood is on their hands they committed adultery with their idols they even sacrificed their children whom they bore to me as food for them they have also done this to me at that same time they defiled my sanctuary and desecrated my sabbaths on the very day they sacrificed their children to their idols they entered my sanctuary and desecrated it that is what they did in my house they even sent messengers for men who came from far away and when they arrived you bathed yourself for them painted your eyes and put on your jewelry you sat on an elegant couch with a table spread before it on which you had placed the incense and oil that belonged to me the noise of a carefree crowd was around her sabeans were brought from the desert along with men from the rabble and they put bracelets on the arms of the woman and her sister and beautiful crowns on their heads then i said about the one worn out by adultery now let them use her as a prostitute for that is all she is and they slept with her as men sleep with a prostitute so they slept with those lewd women oholah and oholibah but righteous men will sentence them to the punishment of women who commit adultery and shed blood because they are adulterous and blood is on their hands this is what the sovereign lord says bring a mob against them and give them over to terror and plunder the mob will stone them and cut them down with their swords they will kill their sons and daughters and burn down their houses so i will put an end to lewdness in the land that all women may take warning and not imitate you you will suffer the penalty for your lewdness and bear the consequences of your sins of idolatry then you will know that i am the sovereign lord in the ninth year in the tenth month on the tenth day the word of the lord came to me son of man record this date this very date because the king of babylon has laid siege to jerusalem this very day tell this rebellious house a parable and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says put on the cooking pot put it on and pour water into it put into it the pieces of meat all the choice pieces the leg and the shoulder fill it with the best of these bones take the pick of the flock pile wood beneath it for the bones bring it to a boil and cook the bones in it for this is what the sovereign lord says woe to the city of bloodshed to the pot now encrusted whose deposit will not go away empty it piece by piece without casting lots for them for the blood she shed is in her midst she poured it on the bare rock she did not pour it on the ground where the dust would cover it to stir up wrath and take revenge i put her blood on the bare rock so that it would not be covered therefore this is what the sovereign lord says woe to the city of bloodshed i too will pile the wood high so heap on the wood and kindle the fire cook the meat well mixing in the spices and let the bones be charred then set the empty pot on the coals till it becomes hot and its copper glows so its impurities may be melted and its deposit burned away it has frustrated all efforts its heavy deposit has not been removed not even by fire now your impurity is lewdness because i tried to cleanse you but you would not be cleansed from your impurity you will not be clean again until my wrath against you has subsided i the lord have spoken the time has come for me to act i will not hold

a lowly kingdom it will be the lowliest of kingdoms and will never again exalt itself above the other nations i will make it so weak that it will never again rule over the nations egypt will no longer be a source of confidence for the people of israel but will be a reminder of their sin in turning to her for help then they will know that i am the sovereign lord in the twenty seventh year in the first month on the first day the word of the lord came to me son of man nebuchadnezzar king of babylon drove his army in a hard campaign against tyre every head was rubbed bare and every shoulder made raw yet he and his army got no reward from the campaign he led against tyre therefore this is what the sovereign lord says i am going to give egypt to nebuchadnezzar king of babylon and he will carry

along with egypt this is what the lord says the allies of egypt will fall and her proud strength will fail from migdol to aswan they will fall by the sword within her declares the sovereign lord they will be desolate among desolate lands and their cities will lie among ruined cities then they will know that i am the lord when i set fire to egypt and all her helpers are crushed on that day messengers will go out from me in ships to frighten cush out of her complacency anguish will take hold of them on the day of egypts doom for it is sure to come this is what the sovereign lord says i

captivity dark will be the day at tahpanhes when i break the yoke of egypt there her proud strength will come to an end she will be covered with clouds and her villages will go into captivity so i will inflict punishment on egypt and they will know that i am the lord in the eleventh year in the first month on the seventh day the word of the lord came to me son of man i have broken the arm of pharaoh king of egypt it has not been bound up for healing or put in a splint so as to become strong enough to hold a sword therefore this is what the sovereign lord says i am against pharaoh king of egypt i will break both his arms the good arm as well as the broken one and make the sword fall from his hand i will disperse the egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon and put my sword in his hand but i will break the arms of pharaoh and he will groan before him like a mortally wounded man i will strengthen the arms of the king of babylon but the arms of pharaoh will fall limp then they will know that i am the lord when i put my sword into the hand of the king of babylon and he brandishes it against egypt i will disperse the egyptians among the nations and scatter them through the countries then they will know that i am the lord in the eleventh year in the third month on the first day the word of the lord came to me son of man say to pharaoh king of egypt and to his hordes who can be compared with you in majesty consider assyria once a cedar in lebanon with beautiful branches overshadowing the forest it towered on high its top above the thick foliage the waters nourished it deep springs made it grow tall their streams flowed all around its base and sent their channels to all the trees of the field so it towered higher than all the trees of the field its boughs increased and its branches grew long spreading because of abundant waters all the birds of the air nested in its boughs all the beasts of the field gave birth under its branches all the great nations lived in its shade it was majestic in beauty with its spreading boughs for its roots went down to abundant waters the cedars in the garden of god could not rival it nor could the pine trees equal its boughs nor could the plane trees compare with its branches no tree in the garden of god could match its beauty i made it beautiful with abundant branches the envy of all the trees of eden in the garden of god therefore this is what the sovereign lord says because it towered on high lifting its top above the thick foliage and because it was proud of its height i handed it over to the ruler of the nations for him to deal with according to its wickedness i cast it aside and the most ruthless of foreign nations cut it down and left it its boughs fell on the mountains and in all the valleys its branches lay broken in all the ravines of the land all the nations of the earth came out from under its shade and left it all the birds of the air settled on the fallen tree and all the beasts of the field were among its branches therefore no other trees by the waters are ever to tower proudly on high lifting their tops above the thick foliage no other trees so well watered are ever to reach such a height they are all destined for death for the earth below among mortal men with those who go down to the pit this is what the sovereign lord says on the day it was brought down to the grave i covered the deep springs with mourning for it i held back its streams and its abundant waters were restrained because of it i clothed lebanon with gloom and all the trees of the field withered away i made the nations tremble at the sound of its fall when i brought it down to the grave with those who go down to the pit then all the trees of eden the choicest and best of lebanon all the trees that were well watered were consoled in the earth below those who lived in its shade its allies among the nations had also gone down to the grave with it joining those killed by the sword which of the trees of eden can be compared with you in splendor and majesty yet you too will be brought down with the trees of eden to the earth below you will lie among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword this is pharaoh and all his hordes declares the sovereign lord in the twelfth year in the twelfth month on the first day the word of the lord came to me son of man take up a lament concerning pharaoh king of egypt and say to him you are like a lion among the nations you are like a monster in the seas thrashing about in your streams churning the water with your feet and muddying the streams this is what the sovereign lord says with a great throng of people i will cast my net over you and they will haul you up in my net i will throw you on the land and hurl you on the open field i will let all the birds of the air settle on you and all the beasts of the earth gorge themselves on you i will spread your flesh on the mountains and fill the valleys with your remains i will drench the land with your flowing blood all the way to the mountains and the ravines will be filled with your flesh when i snuff you out i will cover the heavens and darken their stars i will cover the sun with a cloud and the moon will not give its light all the shining lights in the heavens i will darken over you i will bring darkness over your land declares the sovereign lord i will trouble the hearts of many peoples when i bring about your destruction among the nations among lands you have not known i will cause many peoples to be appalled at you and their kings will shudder with horror because of you when i brandish my sword before them on the day of your downfall each of them will tremble every moment for his life for this is what the sovereign lord says the sword of the king of babylon will come against you i will cause your hordes to fall by the swords of mighty men the most ruthless of all nations they will shatter the pride of egypt and all her hordes will be overthrown i will destroy all her cattle from beside abundant waters no longer to be stirred by the foot of man or muddied by the hoofs of cattle then i will let her waters settle and make her streams flow like oil declares the sovereign lord when i make egypt desolate and strip the land of everything in it when i strike down all who live there then they will know that i am the lord this is the lament they will chant for her the daughters of the nations will chant it for egypt and all her hordes they will chant it declares the sovereign lord in the twelfth year on the fifteenth day of the month the word of the lord came to me son of man wail for the hordes of egypt and consign to the earth below both her and the daughters of mighty nations with those who go down to the pit say to them are you more favored than others go down and be laid among the uncircumcised they will fall among those killed by the sword the sword is drawn let her be dragged off with all her hordes from within the grave the mighty leaders will say of egypt and her allies they have come down and they lie with the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword assyria is there with her whole army she is surrounded by the graves of all her slain all who have fallen by the sword their graves are in the depths of the pit and her army lies around her grave all who had spread terror in the land of the living are slain fallen by the sword elam is there with all her hordes around her grave all of them are slain fallen by the sword all who had spread terror in the land of the living went down uncircumcised to the earth below they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit a bed is made for her among the slain with all her hordes around her grave all of them are uncircumcised killed by the sword because their terror had spread in the land of the living they bear their shame with those who go down to the pit they are laid among the slain meshech and tubal are there with all their hordes around their graves all of them are uncircumcised killed by the sword because they spread their terror in the land of the living do they not lie with the other uncircumcised warriors who have fallen who went down to the grave with their weapons of war whose swords were placed under their heads the punishment for their sins rested on their bones though the terror of these warriors had stalked through the land of the living you too o pharaoh will be broken and will lie among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword edom is there her kings and all her princes despite their power they are laid with those killed by the sword they lie with the uncircumcised with those who go down to the pit all the princes of the north and all the sidonians are there they went down with the slain in disgrace despite the terror caused by their power they lie uncircumcised with those killed by the sword and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit pharaoh he and all his army will see them and he will be consoled for all his hordes that were killed by the sword declares the sovereign lord although i had him spread terror in the land of the living pharaoh and all his hordes will be laid among the uncircumcised with those killed by the sword declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man speak to your countrymen and say to them when i bring the sword against a land and the people of the land choose one of their men and make him their watchman and he sees the sword coming against the land and blows the trumpet to warn the people then if anyone hears the trumpet but does not take warning and the sword comes and takes his life his blood will be on his own head since he heard the sound of the trumpet but did not take warning his blood will be on his own head if he had taken warning he would have saved himself but if the watchman sees the sword coming and does not blow the trumpet to warn the people and the sword comes and takes the life of one of them that man will be taken away because of his sin but i will hold the watchman accountable for his blood son of man i have made you a watchman for the house of israel so hear the word i speak and give them warning from me when i say to the wicked o wicked man you will surely die and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways that wicked man will die for his sin and i will hold you accountable for his blood but if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so he will die for his sin but you will have saved yourself son of man say to the house of israel this is what you are saying our offenses and sins weigh us down and we are wasting away because of them how then can we live say to them as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord i take no pleasure in the death of the wicked but rather that they turn from their ways and live turn turn from your evil ways why will you die o house of israel therefore son of man say to your countrymen the righteousness of the righteous man will not save him when he disobeys and the wickedness of the wicked man will not cause him to fall when he turns from it the righteous man if he sins will not be allowed to live because of his former righteousness if i tell the righteous man that he will surely live but then he trusts in his righteousness and does evil none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered he will die for the evil he has done and if i say to the wicked man you will surely die but he then turns away from his sin and does what is just and right if he gives back what he took in pledge for a loan returns what he has stolen follows the decrees that give life and does no evil he will surely live he will not die none of the sins he has committed will be remembered against him he has done what is just and right he will surely live yet your countrymen say the way of the lord is not just but it is their way that is not just if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil he will die for it and if a wicked man turns away from his wickedness and does what is just and right he will live by doing so yet o house of israel you say the way of the lord is not just but i will judge each of you according to his own ways in the twelfth year of our exile in the tenth month on the fifth day a man who had escaped from jerusalem came to me and said the city has fallen now the evening before the man arrived the hand of the lord was upon me and he opened my mouth before the man came to me in the morning so my mouth was opened and i was no longer silent then the word of the lord came to me son of man the people living in those ruins in the land of israel are saying abraham was only one man yet he possessed the land but we are many surely the land has been given to us as our possession therefore say to them this is what the sovereign lord says since you eat meat with the blood still in it and look to your idols and shed blood should you then possess the land you rely on your sword you do detestable things and each of you defiles his neighbors wife should you then possess the land say this to them this is what the sovereign lord says as surely as i live those who are left in the ruins will fall by the sword those out in the country i will give to the wild animals to be devoured and those in strongholds and caves will die of a plague i will make the land a desolate waste and her proud strength will come to an end and the mountains of israel will become desolate so that no one will cross them then they will know that i am the lord when i have made the land a desolate waste because of all the detestable things they have done as for you son of man your countrymen are talking together about you by the walls and at the doors of the houses saying to each other come and hear the message that has come from the lord my people come to you as they usually do and sit before you to listen to your words but they do not put them into practice with their mouths they express devotion but their hearts are greedy for unjust gain indeed to them you are nothing more than one who sings love songs with a beautiful voice and plays an instrument well for they hear your words but do not put them into practice when all this comes true and it surely will then they will know that a prophet has been among them the word of the lord came to me son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says woe to the shepherds of israel who only take care of themselves should not shepherds take care of the flock you eat the curds clothe yourselves with the wool and slaughter the choice animals but you do not take care of the flock you have not strengthened the weak or healed the sick or bound up the injured you have not brought back the strays or searched for the lost you have ruled them harshly and brutally so they were scattered because there was no shepherd and when they were scattered they became food for all the wild animals my sheep wandered over all the mountains and on every high hill they were scattered over the whole earth and no one searched or looked for them therefore you shepherds hear the word of the lord as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord because my flock lacks a shepherd and so has been plundered and has become food for all the wild animals and because my shepherds did not search for my flock but cared for themselves rather than for my flock therefore o shepherds hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says i am against the shepherds and will hold them accountable for my flock i will remove them from tending the flock so that the shepherds can no longer feed themselves i will rescue my flock from their mouths and it will no longer be food for them for this is what the sovereign lord says i myself will search for my sheep and look after them as a shepherd looks after his scattered flock when he is with them so will i look after my sheep i will rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness i will bring them out from the nations and gather them from the countries and i will bring them into their own land i will pasture them on the mountains of israel in the ravines and in all the settlements in the land i will tend them in a good pasture and the mountain heights of israel will be their grazing land there they will lie down in good grazing land and there they will feed in a rich pasture on the mountains of israel i myself will tend my sheep and have them lie down declares the sovereign lord i will search for the lost and bring back the strays i will bind up the injured and strengthen the weak but the sleek and the strong i will destroy i will shepherd the flock with justice as for you my flock this is what the sovereign lord says i will judge between one sheep and another and between rams and goats is it not enough for you to feed on the good pasture must you also trample the rest of your pasture with your feet is it not enough for you to drink clear water must you also muddy the rest with your feet must my flock feed on what you have trampled and drink what you have muddied with your feet therefore this is what the sovereign lord says to them see i myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep because you shove with flank and shoulder butting all the weak sheep with your horns until you have driven them away i will save my flock and they will no longer be plundered i will judge between one sheep and another i will place over them one shepherd my servant david and he will tend them he will tend them and be their shepherd i the lord will be their god and my servant david will be prince among them i the lord have spoken i will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the desert and sleep in the forests in safety i will bless them and the places surrounding my hill i will send down showers in season there will be showers of blessing the trees of the field will yield their fruit and the ground will yield its crops the people will be secure in their land they will know that i am the lord when i break the bars of their yoke and rescue them from the hands of those who enslaved them they will no longer be plundered by the nations nor will wild animals devour them they will live in safety and no one will make them afraid i will provide for them a land renowned for its crops and they will no longer be victims of famine in the land or bear the scorn of the nations then they will know that i the lord their god am with them and that they the house of israel are my people declares the sovereign lord you my sheep the sheep of my pasture are people and i am your god declares the sovereign lord the word of the lord came to me son of man set your face against mount seir prophesy against it and say this is what the sovereign lord says i am against you mount seir and i will stretch out my hand against you and make you a desolate waste i will turn your towns into ruins and you will be desolate then you will know that i am the lord because you harbored an ancient hostility and delivered the israelites over to the sword at the time of their calamity the time their punishment reached its climax therefore as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord i will give you over to bloodshed and it will pursue you since you did not hate bloodshed bloodshed will pursue you i will make mount seir a desolate waste and cut off from it all who come and go i will fill your mountains with the slain those killed by the sword will fall on your hills and in your valleys and in all your ravines i will make you desolate forever your towns will not be inhabited then you will know that i am the lord because you have said these two nations and countries will be ours and we will take possession of them even though i the lord was there therefore as surely as i live declares the sovereign lord i will treat you in accordance with the anger and jealousy you showed in your hatred of them and i will make myself known among them when i judge you then you will know that i the lord have heard all the contemptible things you have said against the mountains of israel you said they have been laid waste and have been given over to us to devour you boasted against me and spoke against me without restraint and i heard it this is what the sovereign lord says while the whole earth rejoices i will make you desolate because you rejoiced when the inheritance of the house of israel became desolate that is how i will treat you you will be desolate o mount seir you and all of edom then they will know that i am the lord son of man prophesy to the mountains of israel and say o mountains of israel hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says the enemy said of you aha the ancient heights have become our possession therefore prophesy and say this is what the sovereign lord says because they ravaged and hounded you from every side so that you became the possession of the rest of the nations and the object of peoples malicious talk and slander therefore o mountains of israel hear the word of the sovereign lord this is what the sovereign lord says to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys to the desolate ruins and the deserted towns that have been plundered and ridiculed by the rest of the nations around you this is what the sovereign lord says in my burning zeal i have spoken against the rest of the nations and against all edom for with glee and with malice in their hearts they made my land their own possession so that they might plunder its pastureland therefore prophesy concerning the land of israel and say to the mountains and hills to the ravines and valleys this is what the sovereign lord says i speak in my jealous wrath because you have suffered the scorn of the nations therefore this is what the sovereign lord says i swear with uplifted hand that the nations around you will also suffer scorn but you o mountains of israel will produce branches and fruit for my people israel for they will soon come home i am concerned for you and will look on you with favor you will be plowed and sown and i will multiply the number of people upon you even the whole house of israel the towns will be inhabited and the ruins rebuilt i will increase the number of men and animals upon you and they will be fruitful and become numerous i will settle people on you as in the past and will make you prosper more than before then you will know that i am the lord i will cause people my people israel to walk upon you they will possess you and you will be their inheritance you will never again deprive them of their children this is what the sovereign lord says because people say to you you devour men and deprive your nation of its children therefore you will no longer devour men or make your nation childless declares the sovereign lord no longer will i make you hear the taunts of the nations and no longer will you suffer the scorn of the peoples or cause your nation to fall declares the sovereign lord again the word of the lord came to me son of man when the people of israel were living in their own land they defiled it by their conduct and their actions their conduct was like a womans monthly uncleanness in my sight so i poured out my wrath on them because they had shed blood in the land and because they had defiled it with their idols i dispersed them among the nations and they were scattered through the countries i judged them according to their conduct and their actions and wherever they went among the nations they profaned my holy name for it was said of them these are the lord s people and yet they had to leave his land i had concern for my holy name which the house of israel profaned among the nations where they had gone therefore say to the house of israel this is what the sovereign lord says it is not for your sake o house of israel that i am going to do these things but for the sake of my holy name which you have profaned among the nations where you have gone i will show the holiness of my great name which has been profaned among the nations the name you have profaned among them then the nations will know that i am the lord declares the sovereign lord when i show myself holy through you before their eyes for i will take you out of the nations i will gather you from all the countries and bring you back into your own land i will sprinkle clean water on you and you will be clean i will cleanse you from all your impurities and from all your idols i will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you i will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit in you and move you to follow my decrees and be careful to keep my laws you will live in the land i gave your forefathers you will be my people and i will be your god i will save you from all your uncleanness i will call for the grain and make it plentiful and will not bring famine upon you i will increase the fruit of the trees and the crops of the field so that you will no longer suffer disgrace among the nations because of famine then you will remember your evil ways and wicked deeds and you will loathe yourselves for your sins and detestable practices i want you to know that i am not doing this for your sake declares the sovereign lord be ashamed and disgraced for your conduct o house of israel this is what the sovereign lord says on the day i cleanse you from all your sins i will resettle your towns and the ruins will be rebuilt the desolate land will be cultivated instead of lying desolate in the sight of all who pass through it they will say this land that was laid waste has become like the garden of eden the cities that were lying in ruins desolate and destroyed are now fortified and inhabited then the nations around you that remain will know that i the lord have rebuilt what was destroyed and have replanted what was desolate i the lord have spoken and i will do it this is what the sovereign lord says once again i will yield to the plea of the house of israel and do this for them i will make their people as numerous as sheep as numerous as the flocks for offerings at jerusalem during her appointed feasts so will the ruined cities be filled with flocks of people then they will know that i am the lord the hand of the lord was upon me and he brought me out by the spirit of the lord and set me in the middle of a valley it was full of bones he led me back and forth among them and i saw a great many bones on the floor of the valley bones that were very dry he asked me son of man can these bones live i said o sovereign lord you alone know then he said to me prophesy to these bones and say to them dry bones hear the word of the lord this is what the sovereign lord says to these bones i will make breath enter you and you will come to life i will attach tendons to you and make flesh come upon you and cover you with skin i will put breath in you and you will come to life then you will know that i am the lord so i prophesied as i was commanded and as i was prophesying there was a noise a rattling sound and the bones came together bone to bone i looked and tendons and flesh appeared on them and skin covered them but there was no breath in them then he said to me prophesy to the breath prophesy son of man and say to it this is what the sovereign lord says come from the four winds o breath and breathe into these slain that they may live so i prophesied as he commanded me and breath entered them they came to life and stood up on their feet a vast army then he said to me son of man these bones are the whole house of israel they say our bones are dried up and our hope is gone we are cut off therefore prophesy and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says o my people i am going to open your graves and bring you up from them i will bring you back to the land of israel then you my people will know that i am the lord when i open your graves and bring you up from them i will put my spirit in you and you will live and i will settle you in your own land then you will know that i the lord have spoken and i have done it declares the lord the word of the lord came to me son of man take a stick of wood and write on it belonging to judah and the israelites associated with him then take another stick of wood and write on it ephraims stick belonging to joseph and all the house of israel associated with him join them together into one stick so that they will become one in your hand when your countrymen ask you wont you tell us what you mean by this say to them this is what the sovereign lord says i am going to take the stick of joseph which is in ephraims hand and of the israelite tribes associated with him and join it to judahs stick making them a single stick of wood and they will become one in my hand hold before their eyes the sticks you have written on and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says i will take the israelites out of the nations where they have gone i will gather them from all around and bring them back into their own land i will make them one nation in the land on the

to moisten the flour the presenting of this grain offering to the lord is a lasting ordinance so the lamb and the grain offering and the oil shall be provided morning by morning for a regular burnt offering this is what the sovereign lord says if the prince makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his sons it will also belong to his descendants it is to be their property by inheritance if however he makes a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants the servant may keep it until the year of freedom then it will revert to the prince his inheritance belongs to his sons only it is theirs the prince must not take any of the inheritance of the people driving them off their property he is to give his sons their inheritance out of his own property so that none of my people will be separated from his property then the man brought me through the entrance at the side of the gate to the sacred rooms facing north which belonged to the priests and showed me a place at the western end he said to me this is the place where the priests will cook the guilt offering and the sin offering and bake the grain offering to avoid bringing them into the outer court and consecrating the people he then brought me to the outer court and led me around to its four corners and i saw in each corner another court in the four corners of the outer court were enclosed courts forty cubits long and thirty cubits wide each of the courts in the four corners was the same size around the inside of each of the four courts was a ledge of stone with places for fire built all around under the ledge he said to me these are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple will cook the sacrifices of the people the man brought me back to the entrance of the temple and i saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east for the temple faced east the water was coming down from under the south side of the temple south of the altar he then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east and the water was flowing from the south side as the man went eastward with a measuring line in his hand he measured off a thousand cubits and then led me through water that was ankle deep he measured off another thousand cubits and led me through water that was knee deep he measured off another thousand and led me through water that was up to the waist he measured off another thousand but now it was a river that i could not cross because the water had risen and was deep enough to swim in a river that no one could cross he asked me son of man do you see this then he led me back to the bank of the river when i arrived there i saw a great number of trees on each side of the river he said to me this water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the arabah where it enters the sea when it empties into the sea the water there becomes fresh swarms of living creatures will live wherever the river flows there will be large numbers of fish because this water flows there and makes the salt water fresh so where the river flows everything will live fishermen will stand along the shore from en gedi to en eglaim there will be places for spreading nets the fish will be of many kinds like the fish of the great sea but the swamps and marshes will not become fresh they will be left for salt fruit trees of all kinds will grow on both banks of the river their leaves will not wither nor will their fruit fail every month they will bear because the water from the sanctuary flows to them their fruit will serve for food and their leaves for healing this is what the sovereign lord says these are the boundaries by which you are to divide the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of israel

of jehoiakim king of judah nebuchadnezzar king of babylon came to jerusalem and besieged it and the lord delivered jehoiakim king of judah into his hand along with some of the articles from the temple of god these he carried off to the temple of his god in babylonia and put in the treasure house of his god then the king ordered ashpenaz chief of his court officials to bring in some of the israelites from the royal family and the nobility young men without any physical defect handsome showing aptitude for every kind of learning well informed quick to understand and qualified to serve in the kings palace he was to teach them the language and literature of the babylonians the king assigned them a daily amount of food and wine from the kings table they were to be trained for three years and after that they were to enter the kings service among these were some from judah daniel hananiah mishael and azariah the chief official gave them new names to daniel the name belteshazzar to hananiah shadrach to mishael meshach and to azariah abednego but daniel resolved not to defile himself with the royal food and wine and he asked the chief official for permission not to defile himself this way now god had caused the official to show favor and sympathy to daniel but the official told daniel i am afraid of my lord the king who has assigned your food and drink why should he see you looking worse than the other young men your age the king would then have my head because of you daniel then said to the guard whom the chief official had appointed over daniel hananiah mishael and azariah please test your servants for ten days give us nothing but vegetables to eat and water to drink then compare our appearance with that of the young men who eat the royal food and treat your servants in accordance with what you see so he agreed to this and tested them for ten days at the end of the ten days they looked healthier and better nourished than any of the young men who ate the royal food so the guard took away their choice food and the wine they were to drink and gave them vegetables instead to these four young men god gave knowledge and understanding of all kinds of literature and learning and daniel could understand visions and dreams of all kinds at the end of the time set by the king to bring them in the chief official presented them to nebuchadnezzar the king talked with them and he found none equal to daniel hananiah mishael and azariah so they entered the kings service in every matter of wisdom and understanding about which the king questioned them he found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his whole kingdom and daniel remained there until the first year of king cyrus in the second year of his reign nebuchadnezzar had dreams his mind was troubled and he could not sleep so the king summoned the magicians enchanters sorcerers and astrologers to tell him what he had dreamed when they came in and stood before the king he said to them i have had a dream that troubles me and i want to know what it means then the astrologers answered the king in aramaic o king live forever tell your servants the dream and we will interpret it the king replied to the astrologers this is what i have firmly decided if you do not tell me what my dream was and interpret it i will have you cut into pieces and your houses turned into piles of rubble but if you tell me the dream and explain it you will receive from me gifts and rewards and great honor so tell me the dream and interpret it for me once more they replied let the king tell his servants the dream and we will interpret it then the king answered i am certain that you are trying to gain time because you realize that this is what i have firmly decided if you do not tell me the dream there is just one penalty for you you have conspired to tell me misleading and wicked things hoping the situation will change so then tell me the dream and i will know that you can interpret it for me the astrologers answered the king there is not a man on earth who can do what the king asks no king however great and mighty has ever asked such a thing of any magician or enchanter or astrologer what the king asks is too difficult no one can reveal it to the king except the gods and they do not live among men this made the king so angry and furious that he ordered the execution of all the wise men of babylon so the decree was issued to put the wise men to death and men were sent to look for daniel and his friends to put them to death when arioch the commander of the kings guard had gone out to put to death the wise men of babylon daniel spoke to him with wisdom and tact he asked the kings officer why did the king issue such a harsh decree arioch then explained the matter to daniel at this daniel went in to the king and asked for time so that he might interpret the dream for him then daniel returned to his house and explained the matter to his friends hananiah mishael and azariah he urged them to plead for mercy from the god of heaven concerning this mystery so that he and his friends might not be executed with the rest of the wise men of babylon during the night the mystery was revealed to daniel in a vision then daniel praised the god of heaven and said praise be to the name of god for ever and ever wisdom and power are his he changes times and seasons he sets up kings and deposes them he gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning he reveals deep and hidden things he knows what lies in darkness and light dwells with him i thank and praise you o god of my fathers you have given me wisdom and power you have made known to me what we asked of you you have made known to us the dream of the king then daniel went to arioch whom the king had appointed to execute the wise men of babylon and said to him do not execute the wise men of babylon take me to the king and i will interpret his dream for him arioch took daniel to the king at once and said i have found a man among the exiles from judah who can tell the king what his dream means the king asked daniel also called belteshazzar are you able to tell me what i saw in my dream and interpret it daniel replied no wise man enchanter magician or diviner can explain to the king the mystery he has asked about but there is a god in heaven who reveals mysteries he has shown king nebuchadnezzar what will happen in days to come your dream and the visions that passed through your mind as you lay on your bed are these as you were lying there o king your mind turned to things to come and the revealer of mysteries showed you what is going to happen as for me this mystery has been revealed to me not because i have greater wisdom than other living men but so that you o king may know the interpretation and that you may understand what went through your mind you looked o king and there before you stood a large statue an enormous dazzling statue awesome in appearance the head of the statue was made of pure gold its chest and arms of silver its belly and thighs of bronze its legs of iron its feet partly of iron and partly of baked clay while you were watching a rock was cut out but not by human hands it struck the statue on its feet of iron and clay and smashed them then the iron the clay the bronze the silver and the gold were broken to pieces at the same time and became like chaff on a threshing floor in the summer the wind swept them away without leaving a trace but the rock that struck the statue became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth this was the dream and now we will interpret it to the king you o king are the king of kings the god of heaven has given you dominion and power and might and glory in your hands he has placed mankind and the beasts of the field and the birds of the air wherever they live he has made you ruler over them all you are that head of gold after you another kingdom will rise inferior to yours next a third kingdom one of bronze will rule over the whole earth finally there will be a fourth kingdom strong as iron for iron breaks and smashes everything and as iron breaks things to pieces so it will crush and break all the others just as you saw that the feet and toes were partly of baked clay and partly of iron so this will be a divided kingdom yet it will have some of the strength of iron in it even as you saw iron mixed with clay as the toes were partly iron and partly clay so this kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle and just as you saw the iron mixed with baked clay so the people will be a mixture and will not remain united any more than iron mixes with clay in the time of those kings the god of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed nor will it be left to another people it will crush all those kingdoms and bring them to an end but it will itself endure forever this is the meaning of the vision of the rock cut out of a mountain but not by human hands a rock that broke the iron the bronze the clay the silver and the gold to pieces the great god has shown the king what will take place in the future the dream is true and the interpretation is trustworthy then king nebuchadnezzar fell prostrate before daniel and paid him honor and ordered that an offering and incense be presented to him the king said to daniel surely your god is the god of gods and the lord of kings and a revealer of mysteries for you were able to reveal this mystery then the king placed daniel in a high position and lavished many gifts on him he made him ruler over the entire province of babylon and placed him in charge of all its wise men moreover at daniels request the king appointed shadrach meshach and abednego administrators over the province of babylon while daniel himself remained at the royal court king nebuchadnezzar made an image of gold ninety feet high and nine feet wide and set it up on the plain of dura in the province of babylon he then summoned the satraps prefects governors advisers treasurers judges magistrates and all the other provincial officials to come to the dedication of the image he had set up so the satraps prefects governors advisers treasurers judges magistrates and all the other provincial officials assembled for the dedication of the image that king nebuchadnezzar had set up and they stood before it then the herald loudly proclaimed this is what you are commanded to do o peoples nations and men of every language as soon as you hear the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music you must fall down and worship the image of gold that king nebuchadnezzar has set up whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace therefore as soon as they heard the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp and all kinds of music all the peoples nations and men of every language fell down and worshiped the image of gold that king nebuchadnezzar had set up at this time some astrologers came forward and denounced the jews they said to king nebuchadnezzar o king live forever you have issued a decree o king that everyone who hears the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music must fall down and worship the image of gold and that whoever does not fall down and worship will be thrown into a blazing furnace but there are some jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of babylon shadrach meshach and abednego who pay no attention to you o king they neither serve your gods nor worship the image of gold you have set up furious with rage nebuchadnezzar summoned shadrach meshach and abednego so these men were brought before the king and nebuchadnezzar said to them is it true shadrach meshach and abednego that you do not serve my gods or worship the image of gold i have set up now when you hear the sound of the horn flute zither lyre harp pipes and all kinds of music if you are ready to fall down and worship the image i made very good but if you do not worship it you will be thrown immediately into a blazing furnace then what god will be able to rescue you from my hand shadrach meshach and abednego replied to the king o nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter if we are thrown into the blazing furnace the god we serve is able to save us from it and he will rescue us from your hand o king but even if he does not we want you to know o king that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up then nebuchadnezzar was furious with shadrach meshach and abednego and his attitude toward them changed he ordered the furnace heated seven times hotter than usual and commanded some of the strongest soldiers in his army to tie up shadrach meshach and abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace so these men wearing their robes trousers turbans and other clothes were bound and thrown into the blazing furnace the kings command was so urgent and the furnace so hot that the flames of the fire killed the soldiers who took up shadrach meshach and abednego and these three men firmly tied fell into the blazing furnace then king nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement and asked his advisers werent there three men that we tied up and threw into the fire they replied certainly o king he said look i see four men walking around in the fire unbound and unharmed and the fourth looks like a son of the gods nebuchadnezzar then approached the opening of the blazing furnace and shouted shadrach meshach and abednego servants of the most high god come out come here so shadrach meshach and abednego came out of the fire and the satraps prefects governors and royal advisers crowded around them they saw that the fire had not harmed their bodies nor was a hair of their heads singed their robes were not scorched and there was no smell of fire on them then nebuchadnezzar said praise be to the god of shadrach meshach and abednego who has sent his angel and rescued his servants they trusted in him and defied the kings command and were willing to give up their lives rather than serve or worship any god except their own god therefore i decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the god of shadrach meshach and abednego be cut into pieces and their houses be turned into piles of rubble for no other god can save in this way then the king promoted shadrach meshach and abednego in the province of babylon king nebuchadnezzar to the peoples nations and men of every language who live in all the world may you prosper greatly it is my pleasure to tell you about the miraculous signs and wonders that the most high god has performed for me how great are his signs how mighty his wonders his kingdom is an eternal kingdom his dominion endures from generation to generation i nebuchadnezzar was at home in my palace contented and prosperous i had a dream that made me afraid as i was lying in my bed the images and visions that passed through my mind terrified me so i commanded that all the wise men of babylon be brought before me to interpret the dream for me when the magicians enchanters astrologers and diviners came i told them the dream but they could not interpret it for me finally daniel came into my presence and i told him the dream he is called belteshazzar after the name of my god and the spirit of the holy gods is in him i said belteshazzar chief of the magicians i know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no mystery is too difficult for you here is my dream interpret it for me these are the visions i saw while lying in my bed i looked and there before me stood a tree in the middle of the land its height was enormous the tree grew large and strong and its top touched the sky it was visible to the ends of the earth its leaves were beautiful its fruit abundant and on it was food for all under it the beasts of the field found shelter and the birds of the air lived in its branches from it every creature was fed in the visions i saw while lying in my bed i looked and there before me was a messenger a holy one coming down from heaven he called in a loud voice cut down the tree and trim off its branches strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit let the animals flee from under it and the birds from its branches but let the stump and its roots bound with iron and bronze remain in the ground in the grass of the field let him be drenched with the dew of heaven and let him live with the animals among the plants of the earth let his mind be changed from that of a man and let him be given the mind of an animal till seven times pass by for him the decision is announced by messengers the holy ones declare the verdict so that the living may know that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes and sets over them the lowliest of men this is the dream that i king nebuchadnezzar had now belteshazzar tell me what it means for none of the wise men in my kingdom can interpret it for me but you can because the spirit of the holy gods is in you then daniel also called belteshazzar was greatly perplexed for a time and his thoughts terrified him so the king said belteshazzar do not let the dream or its meaning alarm you belteshazzar answered my lord if only the dream applied to your enemies and its meaning to your adversaries the tree you saw which grew large and strong with its top touching the sky visible to the whole earth with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit providing food for all giving shelter to the beasts of the field and having nesting places in its branches for the birds of the air you o king are that tree you have become great and strong your greatness has grown until it reaches the sky and your dominion extends to distant parts of the earth you o king saw a messenger a holy one coming down from heaven and saying cut down the tree and destroy it but leave the stump bound with iron and bronze in the grass of the field while its roots remain in the ground let him be drenched with the dew of heaven let him live like the wild animals until seven times pass by for him this is the interpretation o king and this is the decree the most high has issued against my lord the king you will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals you will eat grass like cattle and be drenched with the dew of heaven seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes the command to leave the stump of the tree with its roots means that your kingdom will be restored to you when you acknowledge that heaven rules therefore o king be pleased to accept my advice renounce your sins by doing what is right and your wickedness by being kind to the oppressed it may be that then your prosperity will continue all this happened to king nebuchadnezzar twelve months later as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of babylon he said is not this the great babylon i have built as the royal residence by my mighty power and for the glory of my majesty the words were still on his lips when a voice came from heaven this is what is decreed for you king nebuchadnezzar your royal authority has been taken from you you will be driven away from people and will live with the wild animals you will eat grass like cattle seven times will pass by for you until you acknowledge that the most high is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and gives them to anyone he wishes immediately what had been said about nebuchadnezzar was fulfilled he was driven away from people and ate grass like cattle his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until his hair grew like the feathers of an eagle and his nails like the claws of a bird at the end of that time i nebuchadnezzar raised my eyes toward heaven and my sanity was restored then i praised the most high i honored and glorified him who lives forever his dominion is an eternal dominion his kingdom endures from generation to generation all the peoples of the earth are regarded as nothing he does as he pleases with the powers of heaven and the peoples of the earth no one can hold back his hand or say to him what have you done at the same time that my sanity was restored my honor and splendor were returned to me for the glory of my kingdom my advisers and nobles sought me out and i was restored to my throne and became even greater than before now i nebuchadnezzar praise and exalt and glorify the king of heaven because everything he does is right and all his ways are just and those who walk in pride he is able to humble king belshazzar gave a great banquet for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them while belshazzar was drinking his wine he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets that nebuchadnezzar his father had taken from the temple in jerusalem so that the king and his nobles his wives and his concubines might drink from them so they brought in the gold goblets that had been taken from the temple of god in jerusalem and the king and his nobles his wives and his concubines drank from them as they drank the wine they praised the gods of gold and silver of bronze iron wood and stone suddenly the fingers of a human hand appeared and wrote on the plaster of the wall near the lampstand in the royal palace the king watched the hand as it wrote his face turned pale and he was so frightened that his knees knocked together and his legs gave way the king called out for the enchanters astrologers and diviners to be brought and said to these wise men of babylon whoever reads this writing and tells me what it means will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around his neck and he will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom then all the kings wise men came in but they could not read the writing or tell the king what it meant so king belshazzar became even more terrified and his face grew more pale his nobles were baffled the queen hearing the voices of the king and his nobles came into the banquet hall o king live forever she said dont be alarmed dont look so pale there is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him in the time of your father he was found to have insight and intelligence and wisdom like that of the gods king nebuchadnezzar your father your father the king i say appointed him chief of the magicians enchanters astrologers and diviners this man daniel whom the king called belteshazzar was found to have a keen mind and knowledge and understanding and also the ability to interpret dreams explain riddles and solve difficult problems call for daniel and he will tell you what the writing means so daniel was brought before the king and the king said to him are you daniel one of the exiles my father the king brought from judah i have heard that the spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight intelligence and outstanding wisdom the wise men and enchanters were brought before me to read this writing and tell me what it means but they could not explain it now i have heard that you are able to give interpretations and to solve difficult problems if you can read this writing and tell me what it means you will be clothed in purple and have a gold chain placed around your neck and you will be made the third highest ruler in the kingdom then daniel answered the king you may keep your gifts for yourself and give your rewards to someone else nevertheless i will read the writing for the king and tell him what it means o king the most high god gave your father nebuchadnezzar sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor because of the high position he gave him all the peoples and nations and men of every language dreaded and feared him those the king wanted to put to death he put to death those he wanted to spare he spared those he wanted to promote he promoted and those he wanted to humble he humbled but when his heart became arrogant and hardened with pride he was deposed from his royal throne and stripped of his glory he was driven away from people and given the mind of an animal he lived with the wild donkeys and ate grass like cattle and his body was drenched with the dew of heaven until he acknowledged that the most high god is sovereign over the kingdoms of men and sets over them anyone he wishes but you his son o belshazzar have not humbled yourself though you knew all this instead you have set yourself up against the lord of heaven you had the goblets from his temple brought to you and you and your nobles your wives and your concubines drank wine from them you praised the gods of silver and gold of bronze iron wood and stone which cannot see or hear or understand but you did not honor the god who holds in his hand your life and all your ways therefore he sent the hand that wrote the inscription this is the inscription that was written mene mene tekel parsin this is what these words mean mene god has numbered the days of your reign and brought it to an end tekel you have been weighed on the scales and found wanting peres your kingdom is divided and given to the medes and persians then at belshazzars command daniel was clothed in purple a gold chain was placed around his neck and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom that very night belshazzar king of the babylonians was slain and darius the mede took over the kingdom at the age of sixty two it pleased darius to appoint 120 satraps to rule throughout the kingdom with three administrators over them one of whom was daniel the satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss now daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom at this the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against daniel in his conduct of government affairs but they were unable to do so they could find no corruption in him because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent finally these men said we will never find any basis for charges against this man daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his god so the administrators and the satraps went as a group to the king and said o king darius live forever the royal administrators prefects satraps advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or man during the next thirty days except to you o king shall be thrown into the lions den now o king issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered in accordance with the laws of the medes and persians which cannot be repealed so king darius put the decree in writing now when daniel learned that the decree had been published he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward jerusalem three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed giving thanks to his god just as he had done before then these men went as a group and found daniel praying and asking god for help so they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or man except to you o king would be thrown into the lions den the king answered the decree stands in accordance with the laws of the medes and persians which cannot be repealed then they said to the king daniel who is one of the exiles from judah pays no attention to you o king or to the decree you put in writing he still prays three times a day when the king heard this he was greatly distressed he was determined to rescue daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him then the men went as a group to the king and said to him remember o king that according to the law of the medes and persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed so the king gave the order and they brought daniel and threw him into the lions den the king said to daniel may your god whom you serve continually rescue you a stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles so that daniels situation might not be changed then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him and he could not sleep at the first light of dawn the king got up and hurried to the lions den when he came near the den he called to daniel in an anguished voice daniel servant of the living god has your god whom you serve continually been able to rescue you from the lions daniel answered o king live forever my god sent his angel and he shut the mouths of the lions they have not hurt me because i was found innocent in his sight nor have i ever done any wrong before you o king the king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift daniel out of the den and when daniel was lifted from the den no wound was found on him because he had trusted in his god at the kings command the men who had falsely accused daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions den along with their wives and children and before they reached the floor of the den the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones then king darius wrote to all the peoples nations and men of every language throughout the land may you prosper greatly i issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the god of daniel for he is the living god and he endures forever his kingdom will not be destroyed his dominion will never end he rescues and he saves he performs signs and wonders in the heavens and on the earth he has rescued daniel from the power of the lions so daniel prospered during the reign of darius and the reign of cyrus the persian in the first year of belshazzar king of babylon daniel had a dream and visions passed through his mind as he was lying on his bed he wrote down the substance of his dream daniel said in my vision at night i looked and there before me were the four winds of heaven churning up the great sea four great beasts each different from the others came up out of the sea the first was like a lion and it had the wings of an eagle i watched until its wings were torn off and it was lifted from the ground so that it stood on two feet like a man and the heart of a man was given to it and there before me was a second beast which looked like a bear it was raised up on one of its sides and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth it was told get up and eat your fill of flesh after that i looked and there before me was another beast one that looked like a leopard and on its back it had four wings like those of a bird this beast had four heads and it was given authority to rule after that in my vision at night i looked and there before me was a fourth beast terrifying and frightening and very powerful it had large iron teeth it crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left it was different from all the former beasts and it had ten horns while i was thinking about the horns there before me was another horn a little one which came up among them and three of the first horns were uprooted before it this horn had eyes like the eyes of a man and a mouth that spoke boastfully as i looked thrones were set in place and the ancient of days took his seat his clothing was as white as snow the hair of his head was white like wool his throne was flaming with fire and its wheels were all ablaze a river of fire was flowing coming out from before him thousands upon thousands attended him ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him the court was seated and the books were opened then i continued to watch because of the boastful words the horn was speaking i kept looking until the beast was slain and its body destroyed and thrown into the blazing fire the other beasts had been stripped of their authority but were allowed to live for a period of time in my vision at night i looked and there before me was one like a son of man coming with the clouds of heaven he approached the ancient of days and was led into his presence he was given authority glory and sovereign power all peoples nations and men of every language worshiped him his dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed i daniel was troubled in spirit and the visions that passed through my mind disturbed me i approached one of those standing there and asked him the true meaning of all this so he told me and gave me the interpretation of these things the four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth but the saints of the most high will receive the kingdom and will possess it forever yes for ever and ever then i wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast which was different from all the others and most terrifying with its iron teeth and bronze claws the beast that crushed and devoured its victims and trampled underfoot whatever was left i also wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and about the other horn that came up before which three of them fell the horn that looked more imposing than the others and that had eyes and a mouth that spoke boastfully as i watched this horn was waging war against the saints and defeating them until the ancient of days came and pronounced judgment in favor of the saints of the most high and the time came when they possessed the kingdom he gave me this explanation the fourth beast is a fourth kingdom that will appear on earth it will be different from all the other kingdoms and will devour the whole earth trampling it down and crushing it the ten horns are ten kings who will come from this kingdom after them another king will arise different from the earlier ones he will subdue three kings he will speak against the most high and oppress his saints and try to change the set times and the laws the saints will be handed over to him for a time times and half a time but the court will sit and his power will be taken away and completely destroyed forever then the sovereignty power and greatness of the kingdoms under the whole heaven will be handed over to the saints the people of the most high his kingdom will be an everlasting kingdom and all rulers will worship and obey him this is the end of the matter i daniel was deeply troubled by my thoughts and my face turned pale but i kept the matter to myself in the third year of king belshazzars reign i daniel had a vision after the one that had already appeared to me in my vision i saw myself in the citadel of susa in the province of elam in the vision i was beside the ulai canal i looked up and there before me was a ram with two horns standing beside the canal and the horns were long one of the horns was longer than the other but grew up later i watched the ram as he charged toward the west and the north and the south no animal could stand against him and none could rescue from his power he did as he pleased and became great as i was thinking about this suddenly a goat with a prominent horn between his eyes came from the west crossing the whole earth without touching the ground he came toward the two horned ram i had seen standing beside the canal and charged at him in great rage i saw him attack the ram furiously striking the ram and shattering his two horns the ram was powerless to stand against him the goat knocked him to the ground and trampled on him and none could rescue the ram from his power the goat became very great but at the height of his power his large horn was broken off and in its place four prominent horns grew up toward the four winds of heaven out of one of them came another horn which started small but grew in power to the south and to the east and toward the beautiful land it grew until it reached the host of the heavens and it threw some of the starry host down to the earth and trampled on them it set itself up to be as great as the prince of the host it took away the daily sacrifice from him and the place of his sanctuary was brought low because of rebellion the host of the saints and the daily sacrifice were given over to it it prospered in everything it did and truth was thrown to the ground then i heard a holy one speaking and another holy one said to him how long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled the vision concerning the daily sacrifice the rebellion that causes desolation and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot he said to me it will take 2300 evenings and mornings then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated while i daniel was watching the vision and trying to understand it there before me stood one who looked like a man and i heard a mans voice from the ulai calling gabriel tell this man the meaning of the vision as he came near the place where i was standing i was terrified and fell prostrate son of man he said to me understand that the vision concerns the time of the end while he was speaking to me i was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground then he touched me and raised me to my feet he said i am going to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath because the vision concerns the appointed time of the end the two horned ram that you saw represents the kings of media and persia the shaggy goat is the king of greece and the large horn between his eyes is the first king the four horns that replaced the one that was broken off represent four kingdoms that will emerge from his nation but will not have the same power in the latter part of their reign when rebels have become completely wicked a stern faced king a master of intrigue will arise he will become very strong but not by his own power he will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does he will destroy the mighty men and the holy people he will cause deceit to prosper and he will consider himself superior when they feel secure he will destroy many and take his stand against the prince of princes yet he will be destroyed but not by human power the vision of the evenings and mornings that has been given you is true but seal up the vision for it concerns the distant future i daniel was exhausted and lay ill for several days then i got up and went about the kings business i was appalled by the vision it was beyond understanding in the first year of darius son of ahasuerus a mede by descent who was made ruler over the babylonian kingdom in the first year of his reign i daniel understood from the scriptures according to the word of the lord given to jeremiah the prophet that the desolation of jerusalem would last seventy years so i turned to the lord god and pleaded with him in prayer and petition in fasting and in sackcloth and ashes i prayed to the lord my god and confessed o lord the great and awesome god who keeps his covenant of love with all who love him and obey his commands we have sinned and done wrong we have been wicked and have rebelled we have turned away from your commands and laws we have not listened to your servants the prophets who spoke in your name to our kings our princes and our fathers and to all the people of the land lord you are righteous but this day we are covered with shame the men of judah and people of jerusalem and all israel both near and far in all the countries where you have scattered us because of our unfaithfulness to you o lord we and our kings our princes and our fathers are covered with shame because we have sinned against you the lord our god is merciful and forgiving even though we have rebelled against him we have not obeyed the lord our god or kept the laws he gave us through his servants the prophets all israel has transgressed your law and turned away refusing to obey you therefore the curses and sworn judgments written in the law of moses the servant of god have been poured out on us because we have sinned against you you have fulfilled the words spoken against us and against our rulers by bringing upon us great disaster under the whole heaven nothing has ever been done like what has been done to jerusalem just as it is written in the law of moses all this disaster has come upon us yet we have not sought the favor of the lord our god by turning from our sins and giving attention to your truth the lord did not hesitate to bring the disaster upon us for the lord our god is righteous in everything he does yet we have not obeyed him now o lord our god who brought your people out of egypt with a mighty hand and who made for yourself a name that endures to this day we have sinned we have done wrong o lord in keeping with all your righteous acts turn away your anger and your wrath from jerusalem your city your holy hill our sins and the iniquities of our fathers have made jerusalem and your people an object of scorn to all those around us now our god hear the prayers and petitions of your servant for your sake o lord look with favor on your desolate sanctuary give ear o god and hear open your eyes and see the desolation of the city that bears your name we do not make requests of you because we are righteous but because of your great mercy o lord listen o lord forgive o lord hear and act for your sake o my god do not delay because your city and your people bear your name while i was speaking and praying confessing my sin and the sin of my people israel and making my request to the lord my god for his holy hill while i was still in prayer gabriel the man i had seen in the earlier vision came to me in swift flight about the time of the evening sacrifice he instructed me and said to me daniel i have now come to give you insight and understanding as soon as you began to pray an answer was given which i have come to tell you for you are highly esteemed therefore consider the message and understand the vision seventy sevens are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish transgression to put an end to sin to atone for wickedness to bring in everlasting righteousness to seal up vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know and understand this from the issuing of the decree to restore and rebuild jerusalem until the anointed one the ruler comes there will be seven sevens and sixty two sevens it will be rebuilt with streets and a trench but in times of trouble after the sixty two sevens the anointed one will be cut off and will have nothing the people of the ruler who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary the end will come like a flood war will continue until the end and desolations have been decreed he will confirm a covenant with many for one seven in the middle of the seven he will put an end to sacrifice and offering and on a wing of the temple he will set up an abomination that causes desolation until the end that is decreed is poured out on him in the third year of cyrus king of persia a revelation was given to daniel who was called belteshazzar its message was true and it concerned a great war the understanding of the message came to him in a vision at that time i daniel mourned for three weeks i ate no choice food no meat or wine touched my lips and i used no lotions at all until the three weeks were over on the twenty fourth day of the first month as i was standing on the bank of the great river the tigris i looked up and there before me was a man dressed in linen with a belt of the finest gold around his waist his body was like chrysolite his face like lightning his eyes like flaming torches his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze and his voice like the sound of a multitude i daniel was the only one who saw the vision the men with me did not see it but such terror overwhelmed them that they fled and hid themselves so i was left alone gazing at this great vision i had no strength left my face turned deathly pale and i was helpless then i heard him speaking and as i listened to him i fell into a deep sleep my face to the ground a hand touched me and set me trembling on my hands and knees he said daniel you who are highly esteemed consider carefully the words i am about to speak to you and stand up for i have now been sent to you and when he said this to me i stood up trembling then he continued do not be afraid daniel since the first day that you set your mind to gain understanding and to humble yourself before your god your words were heard and i have come in response to them but the prince of the persian kingdom resisted me twenty one days then michael one of the chief princes came to help me because i was detained there with the king of persia now i have come to explain to you what will happen to your people in the future for the vision concerns a time yet to come while he was saying this to me i bowed with my face toward the ground and was speechless then one who looked like a man touched my lips and i opened my mouth and began to speak i said to the one standing before me i am overcome with anguish because of the vision my lord and i am helpless how can i your servant talk with you my lord my strength is gone and i can hardly breathe again the one who looked like a man touched me and gave me strength do not be afraid o man highly esteemed he said peace be strong now be strong when he spoke to me i was strengthened and said speak my lord since you have given me strength so he said do you know why i have come to you soon i will return to fight against the prince of persia and when i go the prince of greece will come but first i will tell you what is written in the book of truth no one supports me against them except michael your prince and in the first year of darius the mede i took my stand to support and protect him now then i tell you the truth three more kings will appear in persia and then a fourth who will be far richer than all the others when he has gained power by his wealth he will stir up everyone against the kingdom of greece then a mighty king will appear who will rule with great power and do as he pleases after he has appeared his empire will be broken up and parceled out toward the four winds of heaven it will not go to his descendants nor will it have the power he exercised because his empire will be uprooted and given to others the king of the south will become strong but one of his commanders will become even stronger than he and will rule his own kingdom with great power after some years they will become allies the daughter of the king of the south will go to the king of the north to make an alliance but she will not retain her power and he and his power will not last in those days she will be handed over together with her royal escort and her father and the one who supported her one from her family line will arise to take her place he will attack the forces of the king of the north and enter his fortress he will fight against them and be victorious he will also seize their gods their metal images and their valuable articles of silver and gold and carry them off to egypt for some years he will leave the king of the north alone then the king of the north will invade the realm of the king of the south but will retreat to his own country his sons will prepare for war and assemble a great army which will sweep on like an irresistible flood and carry the battle as far as his fortress then the king of the south will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the north who will raise a large army but it will be defeated when the army is carried off the king of the south will be filled with pride and will slaughter many thousands yet he will not remain triumphant for the king of the north will muster another army larger than the first and after several years he will advance with a huge army fully equipped in those times many will rise against the king of the south the violent men among your own people will rebel in fulfillment of the vision but without success then the king of the north will come and build up siege ramps and will capture a fortified city the forces of the south will be powerless to resist even their best troops will not have the strength to stand the invader will do as he pleases no one will be able to stand against him he will establish himself in the beautiful land and will have the power to destroy it he will determine to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will make an alliance with the king of the south and he will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom but his plans will not succeed or help him then he will turn his attention to the coastlands and will take many of them but a commander will put an end to his insolence and will turn his insolence back upon him after this he will turn back toward the fortresses of his own country but will stumble and fall to be seen no more his successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor in a few years however he will be destroyed yet not in anger or in battle he will be succeeded by a contemptible person who has not been given the honor of royalty he will invade the kingdom when its people feel secure and he will seize it through intrigue then an overwhelming army will be swept away before him both it and a prince of the covenant will be destroyed after coming to an agreement with him he will act deceitfully and with only a few people he will rise to power when the richest provinces feel secure he will invade them and will achieve what neither his fathers nor his forefathers did he will distribute plunder loot and wealth among his followers he will plot the overthrow of fortresses but only for a time with a large army he will stir up his strength and courage against the king of the south the king of the south will wage war with a large and very powerful army but he will not be able to stand because of the plots devised against him those who eat from the kings provisions will try to destroy him his army will be swept away and many will fall in battle the two kings with their hearts bent on evil will sit at the same table and lie to each other but to no avail because an end will still come at the appointed time the king of the north will return to his own country with great wealth but his heart will be set against the holy covenant he will take action against it and then return to his own country at the appointed time he will invade the south again but this time the outcome will be different from what it was before ships of the western coastlands will oppose him and he will lose heart then he will turn back and vent his fury against the holy covenant he will return and show favor to those who forsake the holy covenant his armed forces will rise up to desecrate the temple fortress and will abolish the daily sacrifice then they will set up the abomination that causes desolation with flattery he will corrupt those who have violated the covenant but the people who know their god will firmly resist him those who are wise will instruct many though for a time they will fall by the sword or be burned or captured or plundered when they fall they will receive a little help and many who are not sincere will join them some of the wise will stumble so that they may be refined purified and made spotless until the time of the end for it will still come at the appointed time the king will do as he pleases he will exalt and magnify himself above every god and will say unheard of things against the god of gods he will be successful until the time of wrath is completed for what has been determined must take place he will show no regard for the gods of his fathers or for the one desired by women nor will he regard any god but will exalt himself above them all instead of them he will honor a god of fortresses a god unknown to his fathers he will honor with gold and silver with precious stones and costly gifts he will attack the mightiest fortresses with the help of a foreign god and will greatly honor those who acknowledge him he will make them rulers over many people and will distribute the land at a price at the time of the end the king of the south will engage him in battle and the king of the north will storm out against him with chariots and cavalry and a great fleet of ships he will invade many countries and sweep through them like a flood he will also invade the beautiful land many countries will fall but edom moab and the leaders of ammon will be delivered from his hand he will extend his power over many countries egypt will not escape he will gain control of the treasures of gold and silver and all the riches of egypt with the libyans and nubians in submission but reports from the east and the north will alarm him and he will set out in a great rage to destroy and annihilate many he will pitch his royal tents between the seas at the beautiful holy mountain yet he will come to his end and no one will help him at that time michael the great prince who protects your people will arise there will be a time of distress such as has not happened from the beginning of nations until then but at that time your people everyone whose name is found written in the book will be delivered multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake some to everlasting life others to shame and everlasting contempt those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens and those who lead many to righteousness like the stars for ever and ever but you daniel close up and seal the words of the scroll until the time of the end many will go here and there to increase knowledge then i daniel looked and there before me stood two others one on this bank of the river and one on the opposite bank one of them said to the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river how long will it be before these astonishing things are fulfilled the man clothed in linen who was above the waters of the river lifted his right hand and his left hand toward heaven and i heard him swear by him who lives forever saying it will be for a time times and half a time when the power of the holy people has been finally broken all these things will be completed i heard but i did not understand so i asked my lord what will the outcome of all this be he replied go your way daniel because the words are closed up and sealed until the time of the end many will be purified made spotless and refined but the wicked will continue to be wicked none of the wicked will understand but those who are wise will understand from the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up there will be 1290 days blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1335 days as for you go your way till the end you will rest and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance  the word of the lord that came to hosea son of beeri during the reigns of uzziah jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah and during the reign of jeroboam son of jehoash king of israel when the lord began to speak through hosea the lord said to him go take to yourself an adulterous wife and children of unfaithfulness because the land is guilty of the vilest adultery in departing from the lord so he married gomer daughter of diblaim and she conceived and bore him a son then the lord said to hosea call him jezreel because i will soon punish the house of jehu for the massacre at jezreel and i will put an end to the kingdom of israel in that day i will break israels bow in the valley of jezreel gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter then the lord said to hosea call her lo ruhamah for i will no longer show love to the house of israel that i should at all forgive them yet i will show love to the house of judah and i will save them not by bow sword or battle or by horses and horsemen but by the lord their god after she had weaned lo ruhamah gomer had another son then the lord said call him lo ammi for you are not my people and i am not your god yet the israelites will be like the sand on the seashore which cannot be measured or counted in the place where it was said to them you are not my people they will be called sons of the living god the people of judah and the people of israel will be reunited and they will appoint one leader and will come up out of the land for great will be the day of jezreel say of your brothers my people and of your sisters my loved one rebuke your mother rebuke her for she is not my wife and i am not her husband let her remove the adulterous look from her face and the unfaithfulness from between her breasts otherwise i will strip her naked and make her as bare as on the day she was born i will make her like a desert turn her into a parched land and slay her with thirst i will not show my love to her children because they are the children of adultery their mother has been unfaithful and has conceived them in disgrace she said i will go after my lovers who give me my food and my water my wool and my linen my oil and my drink therefore i will block her path with thornbushes i will wall her in so that she cannot find her way she will chase after her lovers but not catch them she will look for them but not find them then she will say i will go back to my husband as at first for then i was better off than now she has not acknowledged that i was the one who gave her the grain the new wine and oil who lavished on her the silver and gold which they used for baal therefore i will take away my grain when it ripens and my new wine when it is ready i will take back my wool and my linen intended to cover her nakedness so now i will expose her lewdness before the eyes of her lovers no one will take her out of my hands i will stop all her celebrations her yearly festivals her new moons her sabbath days all her appointed feasts i will ruin her vines and her fig trees which she said were her pay from her lovers i will make them a thicket and wild animals will devour them i will punish her for the days she burned incense to the baals she decked herself with rings and jewelry and went after her lovers but me she forgot declares the lord therefore i am now going to allure her i will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her there i will give her back her vineyards and will make the valley of achor a door of hope there she will sing as in the days of her youth as in the day she came up out of egypt in that day declares the lord you will call me my husband you will no longer call me my master i will remove the names of the baals from her lips no longer will their names be invoked in that day i will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the creatures that move along the ground bow and sword and battle i will abolish from the land so that all may lie down in safety i will betroth you to me forever i will betroth you in righteousness and justice in love and compassion i will betroth you in faithfulness and you will acknowledge the lord in that day i will respond declares the lord i will respond to the skies and they will respond to the earth and the earth will respond to the grain the new wine and oil and they will respond to jezreel i will plant her for myself in the land i will show my love to the one i called not my loved one i will say to those called not my people you are my people and they will say you are my god the lord said to me go show your love to your wife again though she is loved by another and is an adulteress love her as the lord loves the israelites though they turn to other gods and love the sacred raisin cakes so i bought her for fifteen shekels of silver and about a homer and a lethek of barley then i told her you are to live with me many days you must not be a prostitute or be intimate with any man and i will live with you for the israelites will live many days without king or prince without sacrifice or sacred stones without ephod or idol afterward the israelites will return and seek the lord their god and david their king they will come trembling to the lord and to his blessings in the last days hear the word of the lord you israelites because the lord has a charge to bring against you who live in the land there is no faithfulness no love no acknowledgment of god in the land there is only cursing lying and murder stealing and adultery they break all bounds and bloodshed follows bloodshed because of this the land mourns and all who live in it waste away the beasts of the field and the birds of the air and the fish of the sea are dying but let no man bring a charge let no man accuse another for your people are like those who bring charges against a priest you stumble day and night and the prophets stumble with you so i will destroy your mother my people are destroyed from lack of knowledge because you have rejected knowledge i also reject you as my priests because you have ignored the law of your god i also will ignore your children the more the priests increased the more they sinned against me they exchanged their glory for something disgraceful they feed on the sins of my people and relish their wickedness and it will be like people like priests i will punish both of them for their ways and repay them for their deeds they will eat but not have enough they will engage in prostitution but not increase because they have deserted the lord to give themselves to prostitution to old wine and new which take away the understanding of my people they consult a wooden idol and are answered by a stick of wood a spirit of prostitution leads them astray they are unfaithful to their god they sacrifice on the mountaintops and burn offerings on the hills under oak poplar and terebinth where the shade is pleasant therefore your daughters turn to prostitution and your daughters in law to adultery i will not punish your daughters when they turn to prostitution nor your daughters in law when they commit adultery because the men themselves consort with harlots and sacrifice with shrine prostitutes a people without understanding will come to ruin though you commit adultery o israel let not judah become guilty do not go to gilgal do not go up to beth aven and do not swear as surely as the lord lives the israelites are stubborn like a stubborn heifer how then can the lord pasture them like lambs in a meadow ephraim is joined to idols leave him alone even when their drinks are gone they continue their prostitution their rulers dearly love shameful ways a whirlwind will sweep them away and their sacrifices will bring them shame hear this you priests pay attention you israelites listen o royal house this judgment is against you you have been a snare at mizpah a net spread out on tabor the rebels are deep in slaughter i will discipline all of them i know all about ephraim israel is not hidden from me ephraim you have now turned to prostitution israel is corrupt their deeds do not permit them to return to their god a spirit of prostitution is in their heart they do not acknowledge the lord israels arrogance testifies against them the israelites even ephraim stumble in their sin judah also stumbles with them when they go with their flocks and herds to seek the lord they will not find him he has withdrawn himself from them they are unfaithful to the lord they give birth to illegitimate children now their new moon festivals will devour them and their fields sound the trumpet in gibeah the horn in ramah raise the battle cry in beth aven lead on o benjamin ephraim will be laid waste on the day of reckoning among the tribes of israel i proclaim what is certain judahs leaders are like those who move boundary stones i will pour out my wrath on them like a flood of water ephraim is oppressed trampled in judgment intent on pursuing idols i am like a moth to ephraim like rot to the people of judah when ephraim saw his sickness and judah his sores then ephraim turned to assyria and sent to the great king for help but he is not able to cure you not able to heal your sores for i will be like a lion to ephraim like a great lion to judah i will tear them to pieces and go away i will carry them off with no one to rescue them then i will go back to my place until they admit their guilt and they will seek my face in their misery they will earnestly seek me come let us return to the lord he has torn us to pieces but he will heal us he has injured us but he will bind up our wounds after two days he will revive us on the third day he will restore us that we may live in his presence let us acknowledge the lord let us press on to acknowledge him as surely as the sun rises he will appear he will come to us like the winter rains like the spring rains that water the earth what can i do with you ephraim what can i do with you judah your love is like the morning mist like the early dew that disappears therefore i cut you in pieces with my prophets i killed you with the words of my mouth my judgments flashed like lightning upon you for i desire mercy not sacrifice and acknowledgment of god rather than burnt offerings like adam they have broken the covenant they were unfaithful to me there gilead is a city of wicked men stained with footprints of blood as marauders lie in ambush for a man so do bands of priests they murder on the road to shechem committing shameful crimes i have seen a horrible thing in the house of israel there ephraim is given to prostitution and israel is defiled also for you judah a harvest is appointed whenever i would restore the fortunes of my people whenever i would heal israel the sins of ephraim are exposed and the crimes of samaria revealed they practice deceit thieves break into houses bandits rob in the streets but they do not realize that i remember all their evil deeds their sins engulf them they are always before me they delight the king with their wickedness the princes with their lies they are all adulterers burning like an oven whose fire the baker need not stir from the kneading of the dough till it rises on the day of the festival of our king the princes become inflamed with wine and he joins hands with the mockers their hearts are like an oven they approach him with intrigue their passion smolders all night in the morning it blazes like a flaming fire all of them are hot as an oven they devour their rulers all their kings fall and none of them calls on me ephraim mixes with the nations ephraim is a flat cake not turned over foreigners sap his strength but he does not realize it his hair is sprinkled with gray but he does not notice israels arrogance testifies against him but despite all this he does not return to the lord his god or search for him ephraim is like a dove easily deceived and senseless now calling to egypt now turning to assyria when they go i will throw my net over them i will pull them down like birds of the air when i hear them flocking together i will catch them woe to them because they have strayed from me destruction to them because they have rebelled against me i long to redeem them but they speak lies against me they do not cry out to me from their hearts but wail upon their beds they gather together for grain and new wine but turn away from me i trained them and strengthened them but they plot evil against me they do not turn to the most high they are like a faulty bow their leaders will fall by the sword because of their insolent words for this they will be ridiculed in the land of egypt put the trumpet to your lips an eagle is over the house of the lord because the people have broken my covenant and rebelled against my law israel cries out to me o our god we acknowledge you but israel has rejected what is good an enemy will pursue him they set up kings without my consent they choose princes without my approval with their silver and gold they make idols for themselves to their own destruction throw out your calf idol o samaria my anger burns against them how long will they be incapable of purity they are from israel this calf a craftsman has made it it is not god it will be broken in pieces that calf of samaria they sow the wind and reap the whirlwind the stalk has no head it will produce no flour were it to yield grain foreigners would swallow it up israel is swallowed up now she is among the nations like a worthless thing for they have gone up to assyria like a wild donkey wandering alone ephraim has sold herself to lovers although they have sold themselves among the nations i will now gather them together they will begin to waste away under the oppression of the mighty king though ephraim built many altars for sin offerings these have become altars for sinning i wrote for them the many things of my law but they regarded them as something alien they offer sacrifices given to me and they eat the meat but the lord is not pleased with them now he will remember their wickedness and punish their sins they will return to egypt israel has forgotten his maker and built palaces judah has fortified many towns but i will send fire upon their cities that will consume their fortresses do not rejoice o israel do not be jubilant like the other nations for you have been unfaithful to your god you love the wages of a prostitute at every threshing floor threshing floors and winepresses will not feed the people the new wine will fail them they will not remain in the lords land ephraim will return to egypt and eat unclean food in assyria they will not pour out wine offerings to the lord nor will their sacrifices please him such sacrifices will be to them like the bread of mourners all who eat them will be unclean this food will be for themselves it will not come into the temple of the lord what will you do on the day of your appointed feasts on the festival days of the lord even if they escape from destruction egypt will gather them and memphis will bury them their treasures of silver will be taken over by briers and thorns will overrun their tents the days of punishment are coming the days of reckoning are at hand let israel know this because your sins are so many and your hostility so great the prophet is considered a fool the inspired man a maniac the prophet along with my god is the watchman over ephraim yet snares await him on all his paths and hostility in the house of his god they have sunk deep into corruption as in the days of gibeah god will remember their wickedness and punish them for their sins when i found israel it was like finding grapes in the desert when i saw your fathers it was like seeing the early fruit on the fig tree but when they came to baal peor they consecrated themselves to that shameful idol and became as vile as the thing they loved ephraims glory will fly away like a bird no birth no pregnancy no conception even if they rear children i will bereave them of every one woe to them when i turn away from them i have seen ephraim like tyre planted in a pleasant place but ephraim will bring out their children to the slayer give them o lord what will you give them give them wombs that miscarry and breasts that are dry because of all their wickedness in gilgal i hated them there because of their sinful deeds i will drive them out of my house i will no longer love them all their leaders are rebellious ephraim is blighted their root is withered they yield no fruit even if they bear children i will slay their cherished offspring my god will reject them because they have not obeyed him they will be wanderers among the nations israel was a spreading vine he brought forth fruit for himself as his fruit increased he built more altars as his land prospered he adorned his sacred stones their heart is deceitful and now they must bear their guilt the lord will demolish their altars and destroy their sacred stones then they will say we have no king because we did not revere the lord but even if we had a king what could he do for us they make many promises take false oaths and make agreements therefore lawsuits spring up like poisonous weeds in a plowed field the people who live in samaria fear for the calf idol of beth aven its people will mourn over it and so will its idolatrous priests those who had rejoiced over its splendor because it is taken from them into exile it will be carried to assyria as tribute for the great king ephraim will be disgraced israel will be ashamed of its wooden idols samaria and its king will float away like a twig on the surface of the waters the high places of wickedness will be destroyed it is the sin of israel thorns and thistles will grow up and cover their altars then they will say to the mountains cover us and to the hills fall on us since the days of gibeah you have sinned o israel and there you have remained did not war overtake the evildoers in gibeah when i please i will punish them nations will be gathered against them to put them in bonds for their double sin ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh so i will put a yoke on her fair neck i will drive ephraim judah must plow and jacob must break up the ground sow for yourselves righteousness reap the fruit of unfailing love and break up your unplowed ground for it is time to seek the lord until he comes and showers righteousness on you but you have planted wickedness you have reaped evil you have eaten the fruit of deception because you have depended on your own strength and on your many warriors the roar of battle will rise against your people so that all your fortresses will be devastated as shalman devastated beth arbel on the day of battle when mothers were dashed to the ground with their children thus will it happen to you o bethel because your wickedness is great when that day dawns the king of israel will be completely destroyed when israel was a child i loved him and out of egypt i called my son but the more i called israel the further they went from me they sacrificed to the baals and they burned incense to images it was i who taught ephraim to walk taking them by the arms but they did not realize it was i who healed them i led them with cords of human kindness with ties of love i lifted the yoke from their neck and bent down to feed them will they not return to egypt and will not assyria rule over them because they refuse to repent swords will flash in their cities will destroy the bars of their gates and put an end to their plans my people are determined to turn from me even if they call to the most high he will by no means exalt them how can i give you up ephraim how can i hand you over israel how can i treat you like admah how can i make you like zeboiim my heart is changed within me all my compassion is aroused i will not carry out my fierce anger nor will i turn and devastate ephraim for i am god and not man the holy one among you i will not come in wrath they will follow the lord he will roar like a lion when he roars his children will come trembling from the west they will come trembling like birds from egypt like doves from assyria i will settle them in their homes declares the lord ephraim has surrounded me with lies the house of israel with deceit and judah is unruly against god even against the faithful holy one ephraim feeds on the wind he pursues the east wind all day and multiplies lies and violence he makes a treaty with assyria and sends olive oil to egypt the lord has a charge to bring against judah he will punish jacob according to his ways and repay him according to his deeds in the womb he grasped his brothers heel as a man he struggled with god he struggled with the angel and overcame him he wept and begged for his favor he found him at bethel and talked with him there the lord god almighty the lord is his name of renown but you must return to your god maintain love and justice and wait for your god always the merchant uses dishonest scales he loves to defraud ephraim boasts i am very rich i have become wealthy with all my wealth they will not find in me any iniquity or sin i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt i will make you live in tents again as in the days of your appointed feasts i spoke to the prophets gave them many visions and told parables through them is gilead wicked its people are worthless do they sacrifice bulls in gilgal their altars will be like piles of stones on a plowed field jacob fled to the country of aram israel served to get a wife and to pay for her he tended sheep the lord used a prophet to bring israel up from egypt by a prophet he cared for him but ephraim has bitterly provoked him to anger his lord will leave upon him the guilt of his bloodshed and will repay him for his contempt when ephraim spoke men trembled he was exalted in israel but he became guilty of baal worship and died now they sin more and more they make idols for themselves from their silver cleverly fashioned images all of them the work of craftsmen it is said of these people they offer human sacrifice and kiss the calf idols therefore they will be like the morning mist like the early dew that disappears like chaff swirling from a threshing floor like smoke escaping through a window but i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt you shall acknowledge no god but me no savior except me i cared for you in the desert in the land of burning heat when i fed them they were satisfied when they were satisfied they became proud then they forgot me so i will come upon them like a lion like a leopard i will lurk by the path like a bear robbed of her cubs i will attack them and rip them open like a lion i will devour them a wild animal will tear them apart you are destroyed o israel because you are against me against your helper where is your king that he may save you where are your rulers in all your towns of whom you said give me a king and princes so in my anger i gave you a king and in my wrath i took him away the guilt of ephraim is stored up his sins are kept on record pains as of a woman in childbirth come to him but he is a child without wisdom when the time arrives he does not come to the opening of the womb i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death where o death are your plagues where o grave is your destruction i will have no compassion even though he thrives among his brothers an east wind from the lord will come blowing in from the desert his spring will fail and his well dry up his storehouse will be plundered of all its treasures the people of samaria must bear their guilt because they have rebelled against their god they will fall by the sword their little ones will be dashed to the ground their pregnant women ripped open return o israel to the lord your god your sins have been your downfall take words with you and return to the lord say to him forgive all our sins and receive us graciously that we may offer the fruit of our lips assyria cannot save us we will not mount war horses we will never again say our gods to what our own hands have made for in you the fatherless find compassion i will heal their waywardness and love them freely for my anger has turned away from them i will be like the dew to israel he will blossom like a lily like a cedar of lebanon he will send down his roots his young shoots will grow his splendor will be like an olive tree his fragrance like a cedar of lebanon men will dwell again in his shade he will flourish like the grain he will blossom like a vine and his fame will be like the wine from lebanon o ephraim what more have i to do with idols i will answer him and care for him i am like a green pine tree your fruitfulness comes from me who is wise he will realize these things who is discerning he will understand them the ways of the lord are right the righteous walk in them but the rebellious stumble in them  the word of the lord that came to joel son of pethuel hear this

have dried up and fire has devoured the open pastures blow the trumpet in zion sound the alarm on my holy hill let all who live in the land tremble for the day of the lord is coming it is close at hand a day of darkness and gloom a day of clouds and blackness like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come before them fire devours behind them a flame blazes before them the land is like the garden of eden behind them a desert waste nothing escapes them they have the appearance of horses they gallop along like cavalry with a noise like that of chariots they leap over the mountaintops like a crackling fire consuming stubble like a mighty army drawn up for battle at the sight of them nations are in anguish every face turns pale they charge like warriors they scale walls like soldiers they all march in line not swerving from their course they do not jostle each other each marches straight ahead they plunge through defenses without breaking ranks they rush upon the city they run along the wall they climb into the houses like thieves they enter through the windows before them the earth shakes the sky trembles the sun and moon are darkened and the stars no longer shine the lord thunders at the head of his army his forces are beyond number and mighty are those who obey his command the day of the lord is great it is dreadful who can endure it even now declares the lord return to me with all your heart with fasting and weeping and mourning rend your heart and not your garments return to the lord your god for he is gracious and compassionate slow to anger and abounding in love and he relents from sending calamity who knows he may turn and have pity and leave behind a blessing grain

children those nursing at the breast let the bridegroom leave his room and the bride her chamber let the priests who minister before the lord weep between the temple porch and the altar let them say spare your people o lord do not make your inheritance an object of scorn a byword among the nations why should they say among the peoples where is their god then the lord will be jealous for his land and take pity on his people the lord will reply to them i am sending you grain new wine and oil enough to satisfy you fully never again will i make you an object of scorn to the nations i will drive the northern army far from you pushing it into a parched and barren land with its front columns going into the eastern sea and those in the rear into the western sea and its stench will go up its smell will rise surely he has done great things be not afraid o land be glad and rejoice surely the lord has done great things be not afraid o wild animals for the open pastures are becoming green the

said among the survivors whom the lord calls in those days and at that time when i restore the fortunes of judah and jerusalem i will gather all nations and bring them down to the valley of jehoshaphat there i will enter into judgment against them concerning my inheritance my people israel for they scattered my people among the nations and divided up my land they cast lots for my people and traded boys for prostitutes they sold girls for wine that they might drink now what have you against me o tyre and sidon and all you regions of philistia are you repaying me for something i have done if you are paying me back i will swiftly and speedily return on your own heads what you have done for you took my silver and my gold and carried off my finest treasures to your temples you sold the people of judah and jerusalem to the greeks that you might send them far from their homeland see i am going to rouse them out of the places to which you sold them and i will return on your own heads what you have done i will sell your sons and daughters to the people of judah and they will sell them to the sabeans a nation far away the lord has spoken proclaim this among the nations prepare for war rouse the warriors let all the fighting men draw near and attack beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears let the weakling say i am strong come quickly all you

every side swing the sickle for the harvest is ripe come trample the grapes for the winepress is full and the vats overflow so great is their wickedness multitudes multitudes in the valley of decision for the day of the lord is near in the valley of decision the sun and moon will be darkened and the stars no longer shine the lord will roar from zion and thunder from jerusalem the earth and the sky will tremble but the lord will be a refuge for his people a stronghold for the people of israel then you will know that i the lord your god dwell in zion my holy hill jerusalem will be holy never again will foreigners invade her in that day the mountains will drip new wine and the hills will flow with milk all the ravines of judah will run with water a fountain will flow out of the lords house and will water the valley of acacias but egypt will be desolate edom a desert waste because of violence done to the people of judah in whose land they shed innocent blood judah will be inhabited forever and jerusalem through all generations their bloodguilt which i have not pardoned i will pardon the lord dwells in zion  the words of amos one of the shepherds of tekoa what he saw concerning israel two years before the earthquake when uzziah was king of judah and jeroboam son of jehoash was king of israel he said the lord roars from zion and thunders from jerusalem the pastures of the shepherds dry up and the top of carmel withers this is what the lord says for three sins of damascus even for four i will not turn back my wrath because she threshed gilead with sledges having iron teeth i will send fire upon the house of hazael that will consume the fortresses of ben hadad i will break down the gate of damascus i will destroy the king who is in the valley of aven and the one who holds the scepter in beth eden the people of aram will go into exile to kir says the lord this is what the lord says for three sins of gaza even for four i will not turn back my wrath because she took captive whole communities and sold them to edom i will send fire upon the walls of gaza that will consume her fortresses i will destroy the king of ashdod and the one who holds the scepter in ashkelon i will turn my hand against ekron till the last of the philistines is dead says the sovereign lord this is what the lord says for three sins of tyre even for four i will not turn back my wrath because she sold whole communities of captives to edom disregarding a treaty of brotherhood i will send fire upon the walls of tyre that will consume her fortresses this is what the lord says for three sins of edom even for four i will not turn back my wrath because he pursued his brother with a sword stifling all compassion because his anger raged continually and his fury flamed unchecked i will send fire upon teman that will consume the fortresses of bozrah this is what the lord says for three sins of ammon even for four i will not turn back {my wrath} because he ripped open the pregnant women of gilead in order to extend his borders i will set fire to the walls of rabbah that will consume her fortresses amid war cries on the day of battle amid violent winds on a stormy day

the bones of edoms king i will send fire upon moab that will consume the fortresses of kerioth moab will go down in great tumult amid war cries and the blast of the trumpet i will destroy her ruler and kill all her officials with him says the lord this is what the lord says for three sins of judah even for four i will not turn back {my wrath} because they have rejected the law of the lord and have not kept his decrees because they have been led astray by false gods the gods their ancestors followed i will send fire upon judah that will consume the fortresses of jerusalem this is what the lord says for three sins of israel even for four i will not turn back {my wrath} they sell the righteous for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals they trample on the heads of the poor as upon the dust of the ground and deny justice to the oppressed father and son use the same girl and so profane my holy name they lie down beside every altar on garments taken in pledge in the house of their god they drink wine taken as fines i destroyed the amorite before them though he was tall as the cedars and strong as the oaks i destroyed his fruit above and his roots below i brought you up out of egypt and i led you forty years in the desert to give you the land of the amorites i also raised up prophets from among your sons and nazirites from among your young men is this not true people of israel declares the lord but you made the nazirites drink wine and commanded the prophets not to prophesy now then i will crush you as a cart crushes when loaded with grain the swift will not escape the strong will not muster their strength and the warrior will not save his life the archer will not stand his ground the fleet footed soldier will not get away and the horseman will not save his life even the bravest warriors will flee naked on that day declares the lord hear this word the lord has spoken against you o people of israel against the whole family i brought up out of egypt you only have i chosen of all the families of the earth therefore i will punish you for all your sins do two walk together unless they have agreed to do so does a lion roar in the thicket when he has no prey does he growl in his den when he has caught nothing does a bird fall into a trap on the ground where no snare has been set does a trap spring up from the earth when there is nothing to catch when a trumpet sounds in a city do not the people tremble when disaster comes to a city has not the lord caused it surely the sovereign lord does nothing without revealing his plan to his servants the prophets the lion has roared who will not fear the sovereign lord has spoken who can but prophesy proclaim to the fortresses of ashdod and to the fortresses of egypt assemble yourselves on the mountains of samaria see the great unrest within her and the oppression among her people they do not know how to do right declares the lord who hoard plunder and loot in their fortresses therefore this is what the sovereign lord says an enemy will overrun the land he will pull down your strongholds and plunder your fortresses this is what the lord says as a shepherd saves from the lions mouth only two leg bones or a piece of an ear so will the israelites be saved those who sit in samaria on the edge of their beds and in damascus on their couches hear this and testify against the house of jacob declares the lord the lord god almighty on the day i punish israel for her sins i will destroy the altars of bethel the horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground i will tear down the winter house along with the summer house the houses adorned with ivory will be destroyed and the mansions will be demolished declares the lord hear this word you cows of bashan on mount samaria you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy and say to your husbands bring us some drinks the sovereign lord has sworn by his holiness the time will surely come when you will be taken away with hooks the last of you with fishhooks you will each go straight out through breaks in the wall and you will be cast out toward harmon declares the lord go to bethel and sin go to gilgal and sin yet more bring your sacrifices every morning your tithes every three years burn leavened bread as a thank offering and brag about your freewill offerings boast about them you israelites for this is what you love to do declares the sovereign lord i gave you empty stomachs in every city and lack of bread in every town yet you have not returned to me declares the lord i also withheld rain from you when the harvest was still three months away i sent rain on one town but withheld it from another one field had rain another had none and dried up people staggered from town to town for water but did not get enough to drink yet you have not returned to me declares the lord many times i struck your gardens and vineyards i struck them with blight and mildew locusts devoured your fig and olive trees yet you have not returned to me declares the lord i sent plagues among you as i did to egypt i killed your young men with the sword along with your captured horses i filled your nostrils with the stench of your camps yet you have not returned to me declares the lord i overthrew some of you as i overthrew sodom and gomorrah you were like a burning stick snatched from the fire yet you have not returned to me declares the lord therefore this is what i will do to you israel and because i will do this to you prepare to meet your god o israel he who forms the mountains creates the wind and reveals his thoughts to man he who turns dawn to darkness and treads the high places of the earth the lord god almighty is his name hear this word o house of israel this lament i take up concerning you fallen is virgin israel never to rise again deserted in her own land with no one to lift her up this is what the sovereign lord says the city that marches out a thousand strong for israel will have only a hundred left the town that marches out a hundred strong will have only ten left this is what the lord says to the house of israel seek me and live do not seek bethel do not go to gilgal do not journey to beersheba for gilgal will surely go into exile and bethel will be reduced to nothing seek the lord and live or he will sweep through the house of joseph like a fire it will devour and bethel will have no one to quench it you who turn justice into bitterness and cast righteousness to the ground he who made the pleiades and orion who turns blackness into dawn and darkens day into night who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land the lord is his name he flashes destruction on the stronghold and brings the fortified city to ruin you hate the one who reproves in court and despise him who tells the truth you trample on the poor and force him to give you grain therefore though you have built stone mansions you will not live in them though you have planted lush vineyards you will not drink their wine for i know how many are your offenses and how great your sins you oppress the righteous and take bribes and you deprive the poor of justice in the courts therefore the prudent man keeps quiet in such times for the times are evil seek good not evil that you may live then the lord god almighty will be with you just as you say he is hate evil love good maintain justice in the courts perhaps the lord god almighty will have mercy on the remnant of joseph therefore this is what the lord the lord god almighty says there will be wailing in all the streets and cries of anguish in every public square the farmers will be summoned to weep and the mourners to wail there will be wailing in all the vineyards for i will pass through your midst says the lord woe to you who long for the day of the lord why do you long for the day of the lord that day will be darkness not light it will be as though a man fled from a lion only to meet a bear as though he entered his house and rested his hand on the wall only to have a snake bite him will not the day of the lord be darkness not light pitch dark without a ray of brightness i hate i despise your religious feasts i cannot stand your assemblies even though you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings i will not accept them though you bring choice fellowship offerings i will have no regard for them away with the noise of your songs i will not listen to the music of your harps but let justice roll on like a river righteousness like a never failing stream did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert o house of israel you have lifted up the shrine of your king the pedestal of your idols the star of your god which you made for yourselves therefore i will send you into exile beyond damascus says the lord whose name is god almighty woe to you who are complacent in zion and to you who feel secure on mount samaria you notable men of the foremost nation to whom the people of israel come go to calneh and look at it go from there to great hamath and then go down to gath in philistia are they better off than your two kingdoms is their land larger than yours you put off the evil day and bring near a reign of terror you lie on beds inlaid with ivory and lounge on your couches you dine on choice lambs and fattened calves you strum away on your harps like david and improvise on musical instruments you drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest lotions but you do not grieve over the ruin of joseph therefore you will be among the first to go into exile your feasting and lounging will end the sovereign lord has sworn by himself the lord god almighty declares i abhor the pride of jacob and detest his fortresses i will deliver up the city and everything in it if ten men are left in one house they too will die and if a relative who is to burn the bodies comes to carry them out of the house and asks anyone still hiding there is anyone with you and he says no then he will say hush we must not mention the name of the lord for the lord has given the command and he will smash the great house into pieces and the small house into bits do horses run on the rocky crags does one plow there with oxen but you have turned justice into poison and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness you who rejoice in the conquest of lo debar and say did we not take karnaim by our own strength for the lord god almighty declares i will stir up a nation against you o house of israel that will oppress you all the way from lebo hamath to the valley of the arabah this is what the sovereign lord showed me he was preparing swarms of locusts after the kings share had been harvested and just as the second crop was coming up when they had stripped the land clean i cried out sovereign lord forgive how can jacob survive he is so small so the lord relented this will not happen the lord said this is what the sovereign lord showed me the sovereign lord was calling for judgment by fire it dried up the great deep and devoured the land then i cried out sovereign lord i beg you stop how can jacob survive he is so small so the lord relented this will not happen either the sovereign lord said this is what he showed me the lord was standing by a wall that had been built true to plumb with a plumb line in his hand and the lord asked me what do you see amosa plumb line i replied then the lord said look i am setting a plumb line among my people israel i will spare them no longer the high places of isaac will be destroyed and the sanctuaries of israel will be ruined with my sword i will rise against the house of jeroboam then amaziah the priest of bethel sent a message to jeroboam king of israel amos is raising a conspiracy against you in the very heart of israel the land cannot bear all his words for this is what amos is saying jeroboam will die by the sword and israel will surely go into exile away from their native land then amaziah said to amos get out you seer go back to the land of judah earn your bread there and do your prophesying there dont prophesy anymore at bethel because this is the kings sanctuary and the temple of the kingdom amos answered amaziah i was neither a prophet nor a prophets son but i was a shepherd and i also took care of sycamore fig trees but the lord took me from tending the flock and said to me go prophesy to my people israel now then hear the word of the lord you say do not prophesy against israel and stop preaching against the house of isaac therefore this is what the lord says your wife will become a prostitute in the city and your sons and daughters will fall by the sword your land will be measured and divided up and you yourself will die in a pagan country and israel will certainly go into exile away from their native land this is what the sovereign lord showed me a basket of ripe fruit what do you see amos he asked a basket of ripe fruit i answered then the lord said to me the time is ripe for my people israel i will spare them no longer in that day declares the sovereign lord the songs in the temple will turn to wailing many many bodies flung everywhere silence hear this you who trample the needy and do away with the poor of the land saying when will the new moon be over that we may sell grain and the sabbath be ended that we may market wheat skimping the measure boosting the price and cheating with dishonest scales buying the poor with silver and the needy for a pair of sandals selling even the sweepings with the wheat the lord has sworn by the pride of jacob i will never forget anything they have done will not the land tremble for this and all who live in it mourn the whole land will rise like the nile it will be stirred up and then sink like the river of egypt in that day declares the sovereign lord i will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth in broad daylight i will turn your religious feasts into mourning and all your singing into weeping i will make all of you wear sackcloth and shave your heads i will make that time like mourning for an only son and the end of it like a bitter day the days are coming declares the sovereign lord when i will send a famine through the land not a famine of food or a thirst for water but a famine of hearing the words of the lord men will stagger from sea to sea and wander from north to east searching for the word of the lord but they will not find it in that day the lovely young women and strong young men will faint because of thirst they who swear by the shame of samaria or say as surely as your god lives o dan or as surely as the god of beersheba lives they will fall never to rise again i saw the lord standing by the altar and he said strike the tops of the pillars so that the thresholds shake bring them down on the heads of all the people those who are left i will kill with the sword not one will get away none will escape though they dig down to the depths of the grave from there my hand will take them though they climb up to the heavens from there i will bring them down though they hide themselves on the top of carmel there i will hunt them down and seize them though they hide from me at the bottom of the sea there i will command the serpent to bite them though they are driven into exile by their enemies there i will command the sword to slay them i will fix my eyes upon them for evil and not for good the lord the lord almighty he who touches the earth and it melts and all who live in it mourn the whole land rises like the nile then sinks like the river of egypt he who builds his lofty palace in the heavens and sets its foundation on the earth who calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out over the face of the land the lord is his name are not you israelites the same to me as the cushites declares the lord did i not bring israel up from egypt the philistines from caphtor and the arameans from kir surely the eyes of the sovereign lord are on the sinful kingdom i will destroy it from the face of the earth yet i will not totally destroy the house of jacob declares the lord for i will give the command and i will shake the house of israel among all the nations as grain is shaken in a sieve and not a pebble will reach the ground all the sinners among my people will die by the sword all those who say disaster will not overtake or meet us in that day i will restore davids fallen tent i will repair its broken places restore its ruins and build it as it used to be so that they may possess the remnant of edom and all the nations that bear my name declares the lord who will do these things the days are coming declares the lord when the reaper will be overtaken by the plowman and the planter by the one treading grapes new wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills i will bring back my exiled people israel they will rebuild the ruined cities and live in them they will plant vineyards and drink their wine they will make gardens and eat their fruit i will plant israel in their own land never again to be uprooted from the land i have given them says the lord your god  the vision of obadiah this is what the sovereign lord says about edom we have heard a message from the lord an envoy was sent to the nations to say rise and let us go against her for battle see i will make you small among the nations you will be utterly despised the pride of your heart has deceived you you who live in the clefts of the rocks and make your home on the heights you who say to yourself who can bring me down to the ground though you soar like the eagle and make your nest among the stars from there i will bring you down declares the lord if thieves came to you if robbers in the night oh what a disaster awaits you would they not steal only as much as they wanted if grape pickers came to you would they not leave a few grapes but how esau will be ransacked his hidden treasures pillaged all your allies will force you to the border your friends will deceive and overpower you those who eat your bread will set a trap for you but you will not detect it in that day declares the lord will i not destroy the wise men of edom men of understanding in the mountains of esau your warriors o teman will be terrified and everyone in esaus mountains will be cut down in the slaughter because of the violence against your brother jacob you will be covered with shame you will be destroyed forever on the day you stood aloof while strangers carried off his wealth and foreigners entered his gates and cast lots for jerusalem you were like one of them you should not look down on your brother in the day of his misfortune nor rejoice over the people of judah in the day of their destruction nor boast so much in the day of their trouble you should not march through the gates of my people in the day of their disaster nor look down on them in their calamity in the day of their disaster nor seize their wealth in the day of their disaster you should not wait at the crossroads to cut down their fugitives nor hand over their survivors in the day of their trouble the day of the lord is near for all nations as you have done it will be done to you your deeds will return upon your own head just as you drank on my holy hill so all the nations will drink continually they will drink and drink and be as if they had never been but on mount zion will be deliverance it will be holy and the house of jacob will possess its inheritance the house of jacob will be a fire and the house of joseph a flame the house of esau will be stubble and they will set it on fire and consume it there will be no survivors from the house of esau the lord has spoken people from the negev will occupy the mountains of esau and people from the foothills will possess the land of the philistines they will occupy the fields of ephraim and samaria and benjamin will possess gilead this company of israelite exiles who are in canaan will possess the land as far as zarephath the exiles from jerusalem who are in sepharad will possess the towns of the negev deliverers will go up on mount zion to govern the mountains of esau and the kingdom will be the lords  the word of the lord came to jonah son of amittai go to the great city of nineveh and preach against it because its wickedness has come up before me but jonah ran away from the lord and headed for tarshish he went down to joppa where he found a ship bound for that port after paying the fare he went aboard and sailed for tarshish to flee from the lord then the lord sent a great wind on the sea and such a violent storm arose that the ship threatened to break up all the sailors were afraid and each cried out to his own god and they threw the cargo into the sea to lighten the ship but jonah had gone below deck where he lay down and fell into a deep sleep the captain went to him and said how can you sleep get up and call on your god maybe he will take notice of us and we will not perish then the sailors said to each other come let us cast lots to find out who is responsible for this calamity they cast lots and the lot fell on jonah so they asked him tell us who is responsible for making all this trouble for us what do you do where do you come from what is your country from what people are you he answered i am a hebrew and i worship the lord the god of heaven who made the sea and the land this terrified them and they asked what have you done they knew he was running away from the lord because he had already told them so the sea was getting rougher and rougher so they asked him what should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us pick me up and throw me into the sea he replied and it will become calm i know that it is my fault that this great storm has come upon you instead the men did their best to row back to land but they could not for the sea grew even wilder than before then they cried to the lord o lord please do not let us die for taking this mans life do not hold us accountable for killing an innocent man for you o lord have done as you pleased then they took jonah and threw him overboard and the raging sea grew calm at this the men greatly feared the lord and they offered a sacrifice to the lord and made vows to him but the lord provided a great fish to swallow jonah and jonah was inside the fish three days and three nights from inside the fish jonah prayed to the lord his god he said in my distress i called to the lord and he answered me from the depths of the grave i called for help and you listened to my cry you hurled me into the deep into the very heart of the seas and the currents swirled about me all your waves and breakers swept over me i said i have been banished from your sight yet i will look again toward your holy temple the engulfing waters threatened me the deep surrounded me seaweed was wrapped around my head to the roots of the mountains i sank down the earth beneath barred me in forever but you brought my life up from the pit o lord my god when my life was ebbing away i remembered you lord and my prayer rose to you to your holy temple those who cling to worthless idols forfeit the grace that could be theirs but i with a song of thanksgiving will sacrifice to you what i have vowed i will make good salvation comes from the lord and the lord commanded the fish and it vomited jonah onto dry land then the word of the lord came to jonah a second time go to the great city of nineveh and proclaim to it the message i give you jonah obeyed the word of the lord and went to nineveh now nineveh was a very important city a visit required three days on the first day jonah started into the city he proclaimed forty more days and nineveh will be overturned the ninevites believed god they declared a fast and all of them from the greatest to the least put on sackcloth when the news reached the king of nineveh he rose from his throne took off his royal robes covered himself with sackcloth and sat down in the dust then he issued a proclamation in nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles do not let any man or beast herd or flock taste anything do not let them eat or drink but let man and beast be covered with sackcloth let everyone call urgently on god let them give up their evil ways and their violence who knows god may yet relent and with compassion turn from his fierce anger so that we will not perish when god saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways he had compassion and did not bring upon them the destruction he had threatened but jonah was greatly displeased and became angry he prayed to the lord o lord is this not what i said when i was still at home that is why i was so quick to flee to tarshish i knew that you are a gracious and compassionate god slow to anger and abounding in love a god who relents from sending calamity now o lord take away my life for it is better for me to die than to live but the lord replied have you any right to be angry jonah went out and sat down at a place east of the city there he made himself a shelter sat in its shade and waited to see what would happen to the city then the lord god provided a vine and made it grow up over jonah to give shade for his head to ease his discomfort and jonah was very happy about the vine but at dawn the next day god provided a worm which chewed the vine so that it withered when the sun rose god provided a scorching east wind and the sun blazed on jonahs head so that he grew faint he wanted to die and said it would be better for me to die than to live but god said to jonah do you have a right to be angry about the vinei do he said i am angry enough to die but the lord said you have been concerned about this vine though you did not tend it or make it grow it sprang up overnight and died overnight but nineveh has more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left and many cattle as well should i not be concerned about that great city  the word of the lord that came to micah of moresheth during the reigns of jotham ahaz and hezekiah kings of judah the vision he saw concerning samaria and jerusalem hear o peoples all of you listen o earth and all who are in it that the sovereign lord may witness against you the lord from his holy temple look the lord is coming from his dwelling place he comes down and treads the high places of the earth the mountains melt beneath him and the valleys split apart like wax before the fire like water rushing down a slope all this is because of jacobs transgression because of the sins of the house of israel what is jacobs transgression is it not samaria what is judahs high place is it not jerusalem therefore i will make samaria a heap of rubble a place for planting vineyards i will pour her stones into the valley and lay bare her foundations all her idols will be broken to pieces all her temple gifts will be burned with fire i will destroy all her images since she gathered her gifts from the wages of prostitutes as the wages of prostitutes they will again be used because of this i will weep and wail i will go about barefoot and naked i will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl for her wound is incurable it has come to judah it has reached the very gate of my people even to jerusalem itself tell it not in gath weep not at all in beth ophrah roll in the dust pass on in nakedness and shame you who live in shaphir those who live in zaanan will not come out beth ezel is in mourning its protection is taken from you those who live in maroth writhe in pain waiting for relief because disaster has come from the lord even to the gate of jerusalem you who live in lachish harness the team to the chariot you were the beginning of sin to the daughter of zion for the transgressions of israel were found in you therefore you will give parting gifts to moresheth gath the town of aczib will prove deceptive to the kings of israel i will bring a conqueror against you who live in mareshah he who is the glory of israel will come to adullam shave your heads in mourning for the children in whom you delight make yourselves as bald as the vulture for they will go from you into exile woe to those who plan iniquity to those who plot evil on their beds at mornings light they carry it out because it is in their power to do it they covet fields and seize them and houses and take them they defraud a man of his home a fellowman of his inheritance therefore the lord says i am planning disaster against this people from which you cannot save yourselves you will no longer walk proudly for it will be a time of calamity in that day men will ridicule you they will taunt you with this mournful song we are utterly ruined my peoples possession is divided up he takes it from me he assigns our fields to traitors therefore you will have no one in the assembly of the lord to divide the land by lot do not prophesy their prophets say do not prophesy about these things disgrace will not overtake us should it be said o house of jacob is the spirit of the lord angry does he do such thingsdo not my words do good to him whose ways are upright lately my people have risen up like an enemy you strip off the rich robe from those who pass by without a care like men returning from battle you drive the women of my people from their pleasant homes you take away my blessing from their children forever get up go away for this is not your resting place because it is defiled it is ruined beyond all remedy if a liar and deceiver comes and says i will prophesy for you plenty of wine and beer he would be just the prophet for this people i will surely gather all of you o jacob i will surely bring together the remnant of israel i will bring them together like sheep in a pen like a flock in its pasture the place will throng with people one who breaks open the way will go up before them they will break through the gate and go out their king will pass through before them the lord at their head then i said listen you leaders of jacob you rulers of the house of israel should you not know justice you who hate good and love evil who tear the skin from my people and the flesh from their bones who eat my peoples flesh strip off their skin and break their bones in pieces who chop them up like meat for the pan like flesh for the pot then they will cry out to the lord but he will not answer them at that time he will hide his face from them because of the evil they have done this is what the lord says as for the prophets who lead my people astray if one feeds them they proclaim peace if he does not they prepare to wage war against him therefore night will come over you without visions and darkness without divination the sun will set for the prophets and the day will go dark for them the seers will be ashamed and the diviners disgraced they will all cover their faces because there is no answer from god but as for me i am filled with power with the spirit of the lord and with justice and might to declare to jacob his transgression to israel his sin hear this you leaders of the house of jacob you rulers of the house of israel who despise justice and distort all that is right who build zion with bloodshed and jerusalem with wickedness her leaders judge for a bribe her priests teach for a price and her prophets tell fortunes for money yet they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us no disaster will come upon us therefore because of you zion will be plowed like a field jerusalem will become a heap of rubble the temple hill a mound overgrown with thickets in the last days the mountain of the lords temple will be established as chief among the mountains it will be raised above the hills and peoples will stream to it many nations will come and say come let us go up to the mountain of the lord to the house of the god of jacob he will teach us his ways so that we may walk in his paths the law will go out from zion the word of the lord from jerusalem he will judge between many peoples and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide they will beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks nation will not take up sword against nation nor will they train for war anymore every man will sit under his own vine and under his own fig tree and no one will make them afraid for the lord almighty has spoken all the nations may walk in the name of their gods we will walk in the name of the lord our god for ever and ever the lord s plan in that day declares the lord i will gather the lame i will assemble the exiles and those i have brought to grief i will make the lame a remnant those driven away a strong nation the lord will rule over them in mount zion from that day and forever as for you o watchtower of the flock o stronghold of the daughter of zion the former dominion will be restored to you kingship will come to the daughter of jerusalem why do you now cry aloud have you no king has your counselor perished that pain seizes you like that of a woman in labor writhe in agony o daughter of zion like a woman in labor for now you must leave the city to camp in the open field you will go to babylon there you will be rescued there the lord will redeem you out of the hand of your enemies but now many nations are gathered against you they say let her be defiled let our eyes gloat over zion but they do not know the thoughts of the lord they do not understand his plan he who gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor rise and thresh o daughter of zion for i will give you horns of iron i will give you hoofs of bronze and you will break to pieces many nations you will devote their ill gotten gains to the lord their wealth to the lord of all the earth marshal your troops o city of troops for a siege is laid against us they will strike israels ruler on the cheek with a rod but you bethlehem ephrathah though you are small among the clans of judah out of you will come for me one who will be ruler over israel whose origins are from of old from ancient times therefore israel will be abandoned until the time when she who is in labor gives birth and the rest of his brothers return to join the israelites he will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the lord in the majesty of the name of the lord his god and they will live securely for then his greatness will reach to the ends of the earth and he will be their peace when the assyrian invades our land and marches through our fortresses we will raise against him seven shepherds even eight leaders of men they will rule the land of assyria with the sword the land of nimrod with drawn sword he will deliver us from the assyrian when he invades our land and marches into our borders the remnant of jacob will be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the lord like showers on the grass which do not wait for man or linger for mankind the remnant of jacob will be among the nations in the midst of many peoples like a lion among the beasts of the forest like a young lion among flocks of sheep which mauls and mangles as it goes and no one can rescue your hand will be lifted up in triumph over your enemies and all your foes will be destroyed in that day declares the lord i will destroy your horses from among you and demolish your chariots i will destroy the cities of your land and tear down all your strongholds i will destroy your witchcraft and you will no longer cast spells i will destroy your carved images and your sacred stones from among you you will no longer bow down to the work of your hands i will uproot from among you your asherah poles and demolish your cities i will take vengeance in anger and wrath upon the nations that have not obeyed me listen to what the lord says stand up plead your case before the mountains let the hills hear what you have to say hear o mountains the lords accusation listen you everlasting foundations of the earth for the lord has a case against his people he is lodging a charge against israel my people what have i done to you how have i burdened you answer me i brought you up out of egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery i sent moses to lead you also aaron and miriam my people remember what balak king of moab counseled and what balaam son of beor answered remember your journey from shittim to gilgal that you may know the righteous acts of the lord with what shall i come before the lord and bow down before the exalted god shall i come before him with burnt offerings with calves a year old will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams with ten thousand rivers of oil shall i offer my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul he has showed you o man what is good and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god listen the lord is calling to the city and to fear your name is wisdom heed the rod and the one who appointed it am i still to forget o wicked house your ill gotten treasures and the short ephah which is accursed shall i acquit a man with dishonest scales with a bag of false weights her rich men are violent her people are liars and their tongues speak deceitfully therefore i have begun to destroy you to ruin you because of your sins you will eat but not be satisfied your stomach will still be empty you will store up but save nothing because what you save i will give to the sword you will plant but not harvest you will press olives but not use the oil on yourselves you will crush grapes but not drink the wine you have observed the statutes of omri and all the practices of ahabs house and you have followed their traditions therefore i will give you over to ruin and your people to derision you will bear the scorn of the nations what misery is mine i am like one who gathers summer fruit at the gleaning of the vineyard there is no cluster of grapes to eat none of the early figs that i crave the godly have been swept from the land not one upright man remains all men lie in wait to shed blood each hunts his brother with a net both hands are skilled in doing evil the ruler demands gifts the judge accepts bribes the powerful dictate what they desire they all conspire together the best of them is like a brier the most upright worse than a thorn hedge the day of your watchmen has come the day god visits you now is the time of their confusion do not trust a neighbor put no confidence in a friend even with her who lies in your embrace be careful of your words for a son dishonors his father a daughter rises up against her mother a daughter in law against her mother in law a mans enemies are the members of his own household but as for me i watch in hope for the lord i wait for god my savior my god will hear me do not gloat over me my enemy though i have fallen i will rise though i sit in darkness the lord will be my light because i have sinned against him i will bear the lords wrath until he pleads my case and establishes my right he will bring me out into the light i will see his righteousness then my enemy will see it and will be covered with shame she who said to me where is the lord your god my eyes will see her downfall even now she will be trampled underfoot like mire in the streets the day for building your walls will come the day for extending your boundaries in that day people will come to you from assyria and the cities of egypt even from egypt to the euphrates and from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain the earth will become desolate because of its inhabitants as the result of their deeds shepherd your people with your staff the flock of your inheritance which lives by itself in a forest in fertile pasturelands let them feed in bashan and gilead as in days long ago as in the days when you came out of egypt i will show them my wonders nations will see and be ashamed deprived of all their power they will lay their hands on their mouths and their ears will become deaf they will lick dust like a snake like creatures that crawl on the ground they will come trembling out of their dens they will turn in fear to the lord our god and will be afraid of you who is a god like you who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance you do not stay angry forever but delight to show mercy you will again have compassion on us you will tread our sins underfoot and hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea you will be true to jacob and show mercy to abraham as you pledged on oath to our fathers in days long ago  an oracle concerning nineveh the book of the vision of nahum the elkoshite the lord is a jealous and avenging god the lord takes vengeance and is filled with wrath the lord takes vengeance on his foes and maintains his wrath against his enemies the lord is slow to anger and great in power the lord will not leave the guilty unpunished his way is in the whirlwind and the storm and clouds are the dust of his feet he rebukes the sea and dries it up he makes all the rivers run dry bashan and carmel wither and the blossoms of lebanon fade the mountains quake before him and the hills melt away the earth trembles at his presence the world and all who live in it who can withstand his indignation who can endure his fierce anger his wrath is poured out like fire the rocks are shattered before him the lord is good a refuge in times of trouble he cares for those who trust in him but with an overwhelming flood he will make an end of nineveh he will pursue his foes into darkness whatever they plot against the lord he will bring to an end trouble will not come a second time they will be entangled among thorns and drunk from their wine they will be consumed like dry stubble from you o nineveh has one come forth who plots evil against the lord and counsels wickedness this is what the lord says although they have allies and are numerous they will be cut off and pass away although i have afflicted you o judah i will afflict you no more now i will break their yoke from your neck and tear your shackles away the lord has given a command concerning you nineveh you will have no descendants to bear your name i will destroy the carved images and cast idols that are in the temple of your gods i will prepare your grave for you are vile look there on the mountains the feet of one who brings good news who proclaims peace celebrate your festivals o judah and fulfill your vows no more will the wicked invade you they will be completely destroyed an attacker advances against you nineveh guard the fortress watch the road brace yourselves marshal all your strength the lord will restore the splendor of jacob like the splendor of israel though destroyers have laid them waste and have ruined their vines the shields of his soldiers are red the warriors are clad in scarlet the metal on the chariots flashes on the day they are made ready the spears of pine are brandished the chariots storm through the streets rushing back and forth through the squares they look like flaming torches they dart about like lightning he summons his picked troops yet they stumble on their way they dash to the city wall the protective shield is put in place the river gates are thrown open and the palace collapses it is decreed that the city be exiled and carried away its slave girls moan like doves and beat upon their breasts nineveh is like a pool and its water is draining away stop stop they cry but no one turns back plunder the silver plunder the gold the supply is endless the wealth from all its treasures she is pillaged plundered stripped hearts melt knees give way bodies tremble every face grows pale where now is the lions den the place where they fed their young where the lion and lioness went and the cubs with nothing to fear the lion killed enough for his cubs and strangled the prey for his mate filling his lairs with the kill and his dens with the prey i am against you declares the lord almighty i will burn up your chariots in smoke and the sword will devour your young lions i will leave you no prey on the earth the voices of your messengers will no longer be heard woe to the city of blood full of lies full of plunder never without victims the crack of whips the clatter of wheels galloping horses and jolting chariots charging cavalry flashing swords and glittering spears many casualties piles of dead bodies without number people stumbling over the corpses all because of the wanton lust of a harlot alluring the mistress of sorceries who enslaved nations by her prostitution and peoples by her witchcraft i am against you declares the lord almighty i will lift your skirts over your face i will show the nations your nakedness and the kingdoms your shame i will pelt you with filth i will treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle all who see you will flee from you and say nineveh is in ruins who will mourn for her where can i find anyone to comfort you are you better than thebes situated on the nile with water around her the river was her defense the waters her wall cush and egypt were her boundless strength put and libya were among her allies yet she was taken captive and went into exile her infants were dashed to pieces at the head of every street lots were cast for her nobles and all her great men were put in chains you too will become drunk you will go into hiding and seek refuge from the enemy all your fortresses are like fig trees with their first ripe fruit when they are shaken the figs fall into the mouth of the eater look at your troops they are all women the gates of your land are wide open to your enemies fire has consumed their bars draw water for the siege strengthen your defenses work the clay tread the mortar repair the brickwork there the fire will devour you the sword will cut you down and like grasshoppers consume you multiply like grasshoppers multiply like locusts you have increased the number of your merchants till they are more than the stars of the sky but like locusts they strip the land and then fly away your guards are like locusts your officials like swarms of locusts that settle in the walls on a cold day but when the sun appears they fly away and no one knows where o king of assyria your shepherds slumber your nobles lie down to rest your people are scattered on the mountains with no one to gather them nothing can heal your wound your injury is fatal everyone who hears the news about you claps his hands at your fall for who has not felt your endless cruelty  the oracle that habakkuk the prophet received how long o lord must i call for help but you do not listen or cry out to you violence but you do not save why do you make me look at injustice why do you tolerate wrong destruction and violence are before me there is strife and conflict abounds therefore the law is paralyzed and justice never prevails the wicked hem in the righteous so that justice is perverted look at the nations and watch and be utterly amazed for i am going to do something in your days that you would not believe even if you were told i am raising up the babylonians that ruthless and impetuous people who sweep across the whole earth to seize dwelling places not their own they are a feared and dreaded people they are a law to themselves and promote their own honor their horses are swifter than leopards fiercer than wolves at dusk their cavalry gallops headlong their horsemen come from afar they fly like a vulture swooping to devour they all come bent on violence their hordes advance like a desert wind and gather prisoners like sand they deride kings and scoff at rulers they laugh at all fortified cities they build earthen ramps and capture them then they sweep past like the wind and go on guilty men whose own strength is their god o lord are you not from everlasting my god my holy one we will not die o lord you have appointed them to execute judgment o rock you have ordained them to punish your eyes are too pure to look on evil you cannot tolerate wrong why then do you tolerate the treacherous why are you silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves you have made men like fish in the sea like sea creatures that have no ruler the wicked foe pulls all of them up with hooks he catches them in his net he gathers them up in his dragnet and so he rejoices and is glad therefore he sacrifices to his

if a person defiled by contact with a dead body touches one of these things does it become defiledyes the priests replied it becomes defiled then haggai said so it is with this people and this nation in my sight declares the lord whatever they do and whatever they offer there is defiled now give careful thought to this from this day on consider how things were before one stone was laid on another in the lords temple when anyone came to a heap of twenty measures there were only ten when anyone went to a wine vat to draw fifty measures there were only twenty i struck all the work of your hands

almighty says return to me declares the lord almighty and i will return to you says the lord almighty do not be like your forefathers to whom the earlier prophets proclaimed this is what the lord almighty says turn from your evil ways and your evil practices but they would not listen or pay attention to me declares the lord where are your forefathers now and the prophets do they live forever but did not my words and my decrees which i commanded my servants the prophets overtake your forefathers then they repented and said the lord almighty has done to us what our ways and practices deserve just as he determined to do the man among the myrtle trees on the twenty fourth day of the eleventh month the month of shebat in the second year of darius the word of the lord came to the prophet zechariah son of berekiah the son of iddo during the night i had a vision and there before me was a man riding a red horse he was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine behind him were red brown and white horses i asked what are these my lord the angel who was talking with me answered i will show you what they are then the man standing among the myrtle trees explained they are the ones the lord has sent to go throughout the earth and they reported to the angel of the lord who was standing among the myrtle trees we have gone throughout the earth and found the whole world at rest and in peace then the angel of the lord said lord almighty how long will you withhold mercy from jerusalem and from the towns of judah which you have been angry with these seventy years so the lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me then the angel who was speaking to me said proclaim this word this is what the lord almighty says i am very jealous for jerusalem and zion but i am very angry with the nations that feel secure i was only a little angry but they added to the calamity therefore this is what the lord says i will return to jerusalem with mercy and there my house will be rebuilt and the measuring line will be stretched out over jerusalem declares the lord almighty proclaim further this is what the lord almighty says my towns will again overflow with prosperity and the lord will again comfort zion and choose jerusalem then i looked up and there before me were four horns i asked the angel who was speaking to me what are these he answered me these are the horns that scattered judah israel and jerusalem then the lord showed me four craftsmen i asked what are these coming to do he answered these are the horns that scattered judah so that no one could raise his head but the craftsmen have come to terrify them and throw down these horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of judah to scatter its people then i looked up and there before me was a man with a measuring line in his hand i asked where are you going he answered me to measure jerusalem to find out how wide and how long it is then the angel who was speaking to me left and another angel came to meet him and said to him run tell that young man jerusalem will be a city without walls because of the great number of men and livestock in it and i myself will be a wall of fire around it declares the lord and i will be its glory within come come flee from the land of the north declares the lord for i have scattered you to the four winds of heaven declares the lord come o zion escape you who live in the daughter of babylon for this is what the lord almighty says after he has honored me and has sent me against the nations that have plundered you for whoever touches you touches the apple of his eye i will surely raise my hand against them so that their slaves will plunder them then you will know that the lord almighty has sent me shout and be glad o daughter of zion for i am coming and i will live among you declares the lord many nations will be joined with the lord in that day and will become my people i will live among you and you will know that the lord almighty has sent me to you the lord will inherit judah as his portion in the holy land and will again choose jerusalem be still before the lord all mankind because he has roused himself from his holy dwelling then he showed me joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the lord and satan standing at his right side to accuse him the lord said to satan the lord rebuke you satan the lord who has chosen jerusalem rebuke you is not this man a burning stick snatched from the fire now joshua was dressed in filthy clothes as he stood before the angel the angel said to those who were standing before him take off his filthy clothes then he said to joshua see i have taken away your sin and i will put rich garments on you then i said put a clean turban on his head so they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him while the angel of the lord stood by the angel of the lord gave this charge to joshua this is what the lord almighty says if you will walk in my ways and keep my requirements then you will govern my house and have charge of my courts and i will give you a place among these standing here listen o high priest joshua and your associates seated before you who are men symbolic of things to come i am going to bring my servant the branch see the stone i have set in front of joshua there are seven eyes on that one stone and i will engrave an inscription on it says the lord almighty and i will remove the sin of this land in a single day in that day each of you will invite his neighbor to sit under his vine and fig tree declares the lord almighty then the angel who talked with me returned and wakened me as a man is wakened from his sleep he asked me what do you see i answered i see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl at the top and seven lights on it with seven channels to the lights also there are two olive trees by it one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left i asked the angel who talked with me what are these my lord he answered do you not know what these areno my lord i replied so he said to me this is the word of the lord to zerubbabel not by might nor by power but by my spirit says the lord almighty what are you o mighty mountain before zerubbabel you will become level ground then he will bring out the capstone to shouts of god bless it god bless it then the word of the lord came to me the hands of zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this temple his hands will also complete it then you will know that the lord almighty has sent me to you who despises the day of small things men will rejoice when they see the plumb line in the hand of zerubbabel these seven are the eyes of the lord which range throughout the earth then i asked the angel what are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand again i asked him what are these two olive branches beside the two gold pipes that pour out golden oil he replied do you not know what these areno my lord i said so he said these are the two who are anointed to serve the lord of all the earth i looked again and there before me was a flying scroll he asked me what do you see i answered i see a flying scroll thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide and he said to me this is the curse that is going out over the whole land for according to what it says on one side every thief will be banished and according to what it says on the other everyone who swears falsely will be banished the lord almighty declares i will send it out and it will enter the house of the thief and the house of him who swears falsely by my name it will remain in his house and destroy it both its timbers and its stones then the angel who was speaking to me came forward and said to me look up and see what this is that is appearing i asked what is it he replied it is a measuring basket and he added this is the iniquity of the people throughout the land then the cover of lead was raised and there in the basket sat a woman he said this is wickedness and he pushed her back into the basket and pushed the lead cover down over its mouth then i looked up and there before me were two women with the wind in their wings they had wings like those of a stork and they lifted up the basket between heaven and earth where are they taking the basket i asked the angel who was speaking to me he replied to the country of babylonia to build a house for it when it is ready the basket will be set there in its place i looked up again and there before me were four chariots coming out from between two mountains mountains of bronze the first chariot had red horses the second black the third white and the fourth dappled all of them powerful i asked the angel who was speaking to me what are these my lord the angel answered me these are the four spirits of heaven going out from standing in the presence of the lord of the whole world the one with the black horses is going toward the north country the one with the white horses toward the west and the one with the dappled horses toward the south when the powerful horses went out they were straining to go throughout the earth and he said go throughout the earth so they went throughout the earth then he called to me look those going toward the north country have given my spirit rest in the land of the north the word of the lord came to me take silver and gold from the exiles heldai tobijah and jedaiah who have arrived from babylon go the same day to the house of josiah son of zephaniah take the silver and gold and make a crown and set it on the head of the high priest joshua son of jehozadak tell him this is what the lord almighty says here is the man whose name is the branch and he will branch out from his place and build the temple of the lord it is he who will build the temple of the lord and he will be clothed with majesty and will sit and rule on his throne and he will be a priest on his throne and there will be harmony between the two the crown will be given to heldai tobijah jedaiah and hen son of zephaniah as a memorial in the temple of the lord those who are far away will come and help to build the temple of the lord and you will know that the lord almighty has sent me to you this will happen if you diligently obey the lord your god in the fourth year of king darius the word of the lord came to zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month the month of kislev the people of bethel had sent sharezer and regem melech together with their men to entreat the lord by asking the priests of the house of the lord almighty and the prophets should i mourn and fast in the fifth month as i have done for so many years then the word of the lord almighty came to me ask all the people of the land and the priests when you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years was it really for me that you fasted and when you were eating and drinking were you not just feasting for yourselves are these not the words the lord proclaimed through the earlier prophets when jerusalem and its surrounding towns were at rest and prosperous and the negev and the western foothills were settled and the word of the lord came again to zechariah this is what the lord almighty says administer true justice show mercy and compassion to one another do not oppress the widow or the fatherless the alien or the poor in your hearts do not think evil of each other but they refused to pay attention stubbornly they turned their backs and stopped up their ears they made their hearts as hard as flint and would not listen to the law or to the words that the lord almighty had sent by his spirit through the earlier prophets so the lord almighty was very angry when i called they did not listen so when they called i would not listen says the lord almighty i scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations where they were strangers the land was left so desolate behind them that no one could come or go this is how they made the pleasant land desolate again the word of the lord almighty came to me this is what the lord almighty says i am very jealous for zion i am burning with jealousy for her this is what the lord says i will return to zion and dwell in jerusalem then jerusalem will be called the city of truth and the mountain of the lord almighty will be called the holy mountain this is what the lord almighty says once again men and women of ripe old age will sit in the streets of jerusalem each with cane in hand because of his age the city streets will be filled with boys and girls playing there this is what the lord almighty says it may seem marvelous to the remnant of this people at that time but will it seem marvelous to me declares the lord almighty this is what the lord almighty says i will save my people from the countries of the east and the west i will bring them back to live in jerusalem they will be my people and i will be faithful and righteous to them as their god this is what the lord almighty says you who now hear these words spoken by the prophets who were there when the foundation was laid for the house of the lord almighty let your hands be strong so that the temple may be built before that time there were no wages for man or beast no one could go about his business safely because of his enemy for i had turned every man against his neighbor but now i will not deal with the remnant of this people as i did in the past declares the lord almighty the seed will grow well the vine will yield its fruit the ground will produce its crops and the heavens will drop their dew i will give all these things as an inheritance to the remnant of this people as you have been an object of cursing among the nations o judah and israel so will i save you and you will be a blessing do not be afraid but let your hands be strong this is what the lord almighty says just as i had determined to bring disaster upon you and showed no pity when your fathers angered me says the lord almighty so now i have determined to do good again to jerusalem and judah do not be afraid these are the things you are to do speak the truth to each other and render true and sound judgment in your courts do not plot evil against your neighbor and do not love to swear falsely i hate all this declares the lord again the word of the lord almighty came to me this is what the lord almighty says the fasts of the fourth fifth seventh and tenth months will become joyful and glad occasions and happy festivals for judah therefore love truth and peace this is what the lord almighty says many peoples and the inhabitants of many cities will yet come and the inhabitants of one city will go to another and say let us go at once to entreat the lord and seek the lord almighty i myself am going and many peoples and powerful nations will come to jerusalem to seek the lord almighty and to entreat him this is what the lord almighty says in those days ten men from all languages and nations will take firm hold of one jew by the hem of his robe and say let us go with you because we have heard that god is with you the word of the lord is against the land of hadrach and will rest upon damascus for the eyes of men and all the tribes of israel are on the lord and upon hamath too which borders on it and upon tyre and sidon though they are very skillful tyre has built herself a stronghold she has heaped up silver like dust and gold like the dirt of the streets but the lord will take away her possessions and destroy her power on the sea and she will be consumed by fire ashkelon will see it and fear gaza will writhe in agony and ekron too for her hope will wither gaza will lose her king and ashkelon will be deserted foreigners will occupy ashdod and i will cut off the pride of the philistines i will take the blood from their mouths the forbidden food from between their teeth those who are left will belong to our god and become leaders in judah and ekron will be like the jebusites but i will defend my house against marauding forces never again will an oppressor overrun my people for now i am keeping watch rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout daughter of jerusalem

attractive and beautiful they will be grain will make the young men thrive and new wine the young women ask the lord for rain in the springtime it is the lord who makes the storm clouds he gives showers of rain to men and plants of the field to everyone the idols speak deceit diviners see visions that lie they tell dreams that are false they give comfort in vain therefore the people wander like sheep oppressed for lack of a shepherd my anger burns against the shepherds and i will punish the leaders for the lord almighty will care for his flock the house of judah and make them like a proud horse in battle from judah will come the cornerstone from him the tent peg from him the battle bow from him every ruler together they will be like mighty men trampling the muddy streets in battle because the lord is with them they will fight and overthrow the horsemen i will strengthen the house of judah and save the house of joseph i will restore them because i have compassion on them

king they will oppress the land and i will not rescue them from their hands so i pastured the flock marked for slaughter particularly the oppressed of the flock then i took two staffs and called one favor and the other union and i pastured the flock in one month i got rid of the three shepherds the flock detested me and i grew weary of them and said i will not be your shepherd let the dying die and the perishing perish let those who are left eat one anothers flesh then i took my staff called favor and broke it revoking the covenant i had made with all the nations it was revoked on that day and so the afflicted of the flock who were watching me knew it was the word of the lord i told them if you think it best give me my pay but if not keep it so they paid me thirty pieces of silver and the lord said to me throw it to the potter the handsome price at which they priced me so i took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the lord to the potter then i broke my second staff called union breaking the brotherhood between judah and israel then the lord said to me take again the equipment of a foolish shepherd for i am going to raise up a shepherd over the land who will not care for the lost or seek the young or heal the injured or feed the healthy but will eat the meat of the choice sheep tearing off their hoofs woe to the worthless shepherd who deserts the flock may the sword strike his arm and his right eye may his arm be completely withered his right eye totally blinded this is the word of the lord concerning israel the lord who stretches out the heavens who lays the foundation of the earth and who forms the spirit of man within him declares i am going to make jerusalem a cup that sends all the surrounding peoples reeling judah will be besieged as well as jerusalem on that day when all the nations of the earth are gathered against her i will make jerusalem an immovable rock for all the nations all who try to move it will injure themselves on that day i will strike every horse with panic and its rider with madness declares the lord i will keep a watchful eye over the house of judah but i will blind all the horses of the nations then the leaders of judah will say in their hearts the people of jerusalem are strong because the lord almighty is their god on that day i will make the leaders of judah like a firepot in a woodpile like a flaming torch among sheaves they will consume right and left all the surrounding peoples but jerusalem will remain intact in her place the lord will save the dwellings of judah first so that the honor of the house of david and of jerusalems inhabitants may not be greater than that of judah on that day the lord will shield those who live in jerusalem so that the feeblest among them will be like david and the house of david will be like god like the angel of the lord going before them on that day i will set out to destroy all the nations that attack jerusalem and i will pour out on the house of david and the inhabitants of jerusalem a spirit of grace and supplication they will look on me the one they have pierced and they will mourn for him as one mourns for an only child and grieve bitterly for him as one grieves for a firstborn son on that day the weeping in jerusalem will be great like the weeping of hadad rimmon in the plain of megiddo the land will mourn each clan by itself with their wives by themselves the clan of the house of david and their wives the clan of the house of nathan and their wives the clan of the house of levi and their wives the clan of shimei and their wives and all the rest of the clans and their wives on that day a fountain will be opened to the house of david and the inhabitants of jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and impurity on that day i will banish the names of the idols from the land and they will be remembered no more declares the lord almighty i will remove both the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land and if anyone still prophesies his father and mother to whom he was born will say to him you must die because you have told lies in the lords name when he prophesies his own parents will stab him on that day every prophet will be ashamed of his prophetic vision he will not put on a prophets garment of hair in order to deceive he will say i am not a prophet i am a farmer the land has been my livelihood since my youth if someone asks him what are these wounds on your body he will answer the wounds i was given at the house of my friends awake o sword against my shepherd against the man who is close to me declares the lord almighty strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered and i will turn my hand against the little ones in the whole land declares the lord two thirds will be struck down and perish yet one third will be left in it this third i will bring into the fire i will refine them like silver and test them like gold they will call on my name and i will answer them i will say they are my people and they will say the lord is our god a day of the lord is coming when your plunder will be divided among you i will gather all the nations to jerusalem to fight against it the city will be captured the houses ransacked and the women raped half of the city will go into exile but the rest of the people will not be taken from the city then the lord will go out and fight against those nations as he fights in the day of battle on that day his feet will stand on the mount of olives east of jerusalem and the mount of olives will be split in two from east to west forming a great valley with half of the mountain moving north and half moving south you will flee by my mountain valley for it will extend to azel you will flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of uzziah king of judah then the lord my god will come and all the holy ones with him on that day there will be no light no cold or frost it will be a unique day without daytime or nighttime a day known to the lord when evening comes there will be light on that day living water will flow out from jerusalem half to the eastern sea and half to the western sea in summer and in winter the lord will be king over the whole earth on that day there will be one lord and his name the only name the whole land from geba to rimmon south of jerusalem will become like the arabah but jerusalem will be raised up and remain in its place from the benjamin gate to the site of the first gate to the corner gate and from the tower of hananel to the royal winepresses it will be inhabited never again will it be destroyed jerusalem will be secure this is the plague with which the lord will strike all the nations that fought against jerusalem their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet their eyes will rot in their sockets and their tongues will rot in their mouths on that day men will be stricken by the lord with great panic each man will seize the hand of another and they will attack each other judah too will fight at jerusalem the wealth of all the surrounding nations will be collected great quantities of gold and silver and clothing a similar plague will strike the horses and mules the camels and donkeys and all the animals in those camps then the survivors from all the nations that have attacked jerusalem will go up year after year to worship the king the lord almighty and to celebrate the feast of tabernacles if any of the peoples of the earth do not go up to jerusalem to worship the king the lord almighty they will have no rain if the egyptian people do not go up and take part they will have no rain the lord will bring on them the plague he inflicts on the nations that do not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles this will be the punishment of egypt and the punishment of all the nations that do not go up to celebrate the feast of tabernacles on that dayholy to the lord will be inscribed on the bells of the horses and the cooking pots in the lords house will be like the sacred bowls in front of the altar every pot in jerusalem and judah will be holy to the lord almighty and all who come to sacrifice will take some of the pots and cook in them and on that day there will no longer be a canaanite in the house of the lord almighty  an oracle the word of the lord to israel through malachi i have loved you says the lord but you ask how have you loved uswas not esau jacobs brother the lord says yet i have loved jacob but esau i have hated and i have turned his mountains into a wasteland and left his inheritance to the desert jackals edom may say though we have been crushed we will rebuild the ruins but this is what the lord almighty says they may build but i will demolish they will be called the wicked land a people always under the wrath of the lord you will see it with your own eyes and say great is the lord even beyond the borders of israel a son honors his father and a servant his master if i am a father where is the honor due me if i am a master where is the respect due me says the lord almighty it is you o priests who show contempt for my name but you ask how have we shown contempt for your name you place defiled food on my altar but you ask how have we defiled youby saying that the lords table is contemptible when you bring blind animals for sacrifice is that not wrong when you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals is that not wrong try offering them to your governor would he be pleased with you would he accept you says the lord almighty now implore god to be gracious to us with such offerings from your hands will he accept you says the lord almighty oh that one of you would shut the temple doors so that you would not light useless fires on my altar i am not pleased with you says the lord almighty and i will accept no offering from your hands my name will be great among the nations from the rising to the setting of the sun in every place incense and pure offerings will be brought to my name because my name will be great among the nations says the lord almighty but you profane it by saying of the lords table it is defiled and of its food it is contemptible and you say what a burden and you sniff at it contemptuously says the lord almighty when you bring injured crippled or diseased animals and offer them as sacrifices should i accept them from your hands says the lord cursed is the cheat who has an acceptable male in his flock and vows to give it but then sacrifices a blemished animal to the lord for i am a great king says the lord almighty and my name is to be feared among the nations and now this admonition is for you o priests if you do not listen and if you do not set your heart to honor my name says the lord almighty i will send a curse upon you and i will curse your blessings yes i have already cursed them because you have not set your heart to honor me because of you i will rebuke your descendants i will spread on your faces the offal from your festival sacrifices and you will be carried off with it and you will know that i have sent you this admonition so that my covenant with levi may continue says the lord almighty my covenant was with him a covenant of life and peace and i gave them to him this called for reverence and he revered me and stood in awe of my name true instruction was in his mouth and nothing false was found on his lips he walked with me in peace and uprightness and turned many from sin for the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge and from his mouth men should seek instruction because he is the messenger of the lord almighty but you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble you have violated the covenant with levi says the lord almighty so i have caused you to be despised and humiliated before all the people because you have not followed my ways but have shown partiality in matters of the law have we not all one father did not one god create us why do we profane the covenant of our fathers by breaking faith with one another judah has broken faith a detestable thing has been committed in israel and in jerusalem judah has desecrated the sanctuary the lord loves by marrying the daughter of a foreign god as for the man who does this whoever he may be may the lord cut him off from the tents of jacob even though he brings offerings to the lord almighty another thing you do you flood the lords altar with tears you weep and wail because he no longer pays attention to your offerings or accepts them with pleasure from your hands you ask why it is because the lord is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth because you have broken faith with her though she is your partner the wife of your marriage covenant has not the lord made them one in flesh and spirit they are his and why one because he was seeking godly offspring so guard yourself in your spirit and do not break faith with the wife of your youth i hate divorce says the lord god of israel and i hate a mans covering himself with violence as well as with his garment says the lord almighty so guard yourself in your spirit and do not break faith you have wearied the lord with your words how have we wearied him you ask by saying all who do evil are good in the eyes of the lord and he is pleased with them or where is the god of justice see i will send my messenger who will prepare the way before me then suddenly the lord you are seeking will come to his temple the messenger of the covenant whom you desire will come says the lord almighty but who can endure the day of his coming who can stand when he appears for he will be like a refiners fire or a launderers soap he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver he will purify the levites and refine them like gold and silver then the lord will have men who will bring offerings in righteousness and the offerings of judah and jerusalem will be acceptable to the lord as in days gone by as in former years so i will come near to you for judgment i will be quick to testify against sorcerers adulterers and perjurers against those who defraud laborers of their wages who oppress the widows and the fatherless and deprive aliens of justice but do not fear me says the lord almighty i the lord do not change so you o descendants of jacob are not destroyed ever since the time of your forefathers you have turned away from my decrees and have not kept them return to me and i will return to you says the lord almighty but you ask how are we to return will a man rob god yet you rob me but you ask how do we rob youin tithes and offerings you are under a curse the whole nation of you because you are robbing me bring the whole tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house test me in this says the lord almighty and see if i will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that you will not have room enough for it i will prevent pests from devouring your crops and the vines in your fields will not cast their fruit says the lord almighty then all the nations will call you blessed for yours will be a delightful land says the lord almighty you have said harsh things against me says the lord yet you ask what have we said against you you have said it is futile to serve god what did we gain by carrying out his requirements and going about like mourners before the lord almighty but now we call the arrogant blessed certainly the evildoers prosper and even those who challenge god escape then those who feared the lord talked with each other and the lord listened and heard a scroll of remembrance was written in his presence concerning those who feared the lord and honored his name they will be mine says the lord almighty in the day when i make up my treasured possession i will spare them just as in compassion a man spares his son who serves him and you will again see the distinction between the righteous and the wicked between those who serve god and those who do not surely the day is coming it will burn like a furnace all the arrogant and every evildoer will be stubble and that day that is coming will set them on fire says the lord almighty not a root or a branch will be left to them but for you who revere my name the sun of righteousness will rise with healing in its wings and you will go out and leap like calves released from the stall then you will trample down the wicked they will be ashes under the soles of your feet on the day when i do these things says the lord almighty remember the law of my servant moses the decrees and laws i gave him at horeb for all israel see i will send you the prophet elijah before that great and dreadful day of the lord comes he will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the hearts of the children to their fathers or else i will come and strike the land with a curse  a record of the genealogy of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham abraham was the father of isaac isaac the father of jacob jacob the father of judah and his brothers judah the father of perez and zerah whose mother was tamar perez the father of hezron hezron the father of ram ram the father of amminadab amminadab the father of nahshon nahshon the father of salmon salmon the father of boaz whose mother was rahab boaz the father of obed whose mother was ruth obed the father of jesse and jesse the father of king david david was the father of solomon whose mother had been uriahs wife solomon the father of rehoboam rehoboam the father of abijah abijah the father of asa asa the father of jehoshaphat jehoshaphat the father of jehoram jehoram the father of uzziah uzziah the father of jotham jotham the father of ahaz ahaz the father of hezekiah hezekiah the father of manasseh manasseh the father of amon amon the father of josiah and josiah the father of jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the exile to babylon after the exile to babylon jeconiah was the father of shealtiel shealtiel the father of zerubbabel zerubbabel the father of abiud abiud the father of eliakim eliakim the father of azor azor the father of zadok zadok the father of akim akim the father of eliud eliud the father of eleazar eleazar the father of matthan matthan the father of jacob and jacob the father of joseph the husband of mary of whom was born jesus who is called christ thus there were fourteen generations in all from abraham to david fourteen from david to the exile to babylon and fourteen from the exile to the christ this is how the birth of jesus christ came about his mother mary was pledged to be married to joseph but before they came together she was found to be with child through the holy spirit because joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace he had in mind to divorce her quietly but after he had considered this an angel of the lord appeared to him in a dream and said joseph son of david do not be afraid to take mary home as your wife because what is conceived in her is from the holy spirit she will give birth to a son and you are to give him the name jesus because he will save his people from their sins all this took place to fulfill what the lord had said through the prophet the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and they will call him immanuel which means god with us when joseph woke up he did what the angel of the lord had commanded him and took mary home as his wife but he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name jesus after jesus was born in bethlehem in judea during the time of king herod magi from the east came to jerusalem and asked where is the one who has been born king of the jews we saw his star in the east and have come to worship him when king herod heard this he was disturbed and all jerusalem with him when he had called together all the peoples chief priests and teachers of the law he asked them where the christ was to be born in bethlehem in judea they replied for this is what the prophet has written but you bethlehem in the land of judah are by no means least among the rulers of judah for out of you will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of my people israel then herod called the magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared he sent them to bethlehem and said go and make a careful search for the child as soon as you find him report to me so that i too may go and worship him after they had heard the king they went on their way and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it stopped over the place where the child was when they saw the star they were overjoyed on coming to the house they saw the child with his mother mary and they bowed down and worshiped him then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold and of incense and of myrrh and having been warned in a dream not to go back to herod they returned to their country by another route when they had gone an angel of the lord appeared to joseph in a dream get up he said take the child and his mother and escape to egypt stay there until i tell you for herod is going to search for the child to kill him so he got up took the child and his mother during the night and left for egypt where he stayed until the death of herod and so was fulfilled what the lord had said through the prophet out of egypt i called my son when herod realized that he had been outwitted by the magi he was furious and he gave orders to kill all the boys in bethlehem and its vicinity who were two years old and under in accordance with the time he had learned from the magi then what was said through the prophet jeremiah was fulfilled a voice is heard in ramah weeping and great mourning rachel weeping for her children and refusing to be comforted because they are no more after herod died an angel of the lord appeared in a dream to joseph in egypt and said get up take the child and his mother and go to the land of israel for those who were trying to take the childs life are dead so he got up took the child and his mother and went to the land of israel but when he heard that archelaus was reigning in judea in place of his father herod he was afraid to go there having been warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of galilee and he went and lived in a town called nazareth so was fulfilled what was said through the prophets he will be called a nazarene in those days john the baptist came preaching in the desert of judea and saying repent for the kingdom of heaven is near this is he who was spoken of through the prophet isaiah a voice of one calling in the desert prepare the way for the lord make straight paths for him johns clothes were made of camels hair and he had a leather belt around his waist his food was locusts and wild honey people went out to him from jerusalem and all judea and the whole region of the jordan confessing their sins they were baptized by him in the jordan river but when he saw many of the pharisees and sadducees coming to where he was baptizing he said to them you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath produce fruit in keeping with repentance and do not think you can say to yourselves we have abraham as our father i tell you that out of these stones god can raise up children for abraham the ax is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire i baptize you with water for repentance but after me will come one who is more powerful than i whose sandals i am not fit to carry he will baptize you with the holy spirit and with fire his winnowing fork is in his hand and he will clear his threshing floor gathering his wheat into the barn and burning up the chaff with unquenchable fire then jesus came from galilee to the jordan to be baptized by john but john tried to deter him saying i need to be baptized by you and do you come to me jesus replied let it be so now it is proper for us to do this to fulfill all righteousness then john consented as soon as jesus was baptized he went up out of the water at that moment heaven was opened and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lighting on him and a voice from heaven said this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased then jesus was led by the spirit into the desert to be tempted by the devil after fasting forty days and forty nights he was hungry the tempter came to him and said if you are the son of god tell these stones to become bread jesus answered it is written man does not live on bread alone but on every word that comes from the mouth of god then the devil took him to the holy city and had him stand on the highest point of the temple if you are the son of god he said throw yourself down for it is written he will command his angels concerning you and they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone jesus answered him it is also written do not put the lord your god to the test again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor all this i will give you he said if you will bow down and worship me jesus said to him away from me satan for it is written worship the lord your god and serve him only then the devil left him and angels came and attended him when jesus heard that john had been put in prison he returned to galilee leaving nazareth he went and lived in capernaum which was by the lake in the area of zebulun and naphtali to fulfill what was said through the prophet isaiah land of zebulun and land of naphtali the way to the sea along the jordan galilee of the gentiles the people living in darkness have seen a great light on those living in the land of the shadow of death a light has dawned from that time on jesus began to preach repent for the kingdom of heaven is near as jesus was walking beside the sea of galilee he saw two brothers simon called peter and his brother andrew they were casting a net into the lake for they were fishermen come follow me jesus said and i will make you fishers of men at once they left their nets and followed him going on from there he saw two other brothers james son of zebedee and his brother john they were in a boat with their father zebedee preparing their nets jesus called them and immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him jesus went throughout galilee teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness among the people news about him spread all over syria and people brought to him all who were ill with various diseases those suffering severe pain the demon possessed those having seizures and the paralyzed and he healed them large crowds from galilee the decapolis jerusalem judea and the region across the jordan followed him now when he saw the crowds he went up on a mountainside and sat down his disciples came to him and he began to teach them saying blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are those who mourn for they will be comforted blessed are the meek for they will inherit the earth blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they will be filled blessed are the merciful for they will be shown mercy blessed are the pure in heart for they will see god blessed are the peacemakers for they will be called sons of god blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness for theirs is the kingdom of heaven blessed are you when people insult you persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me rejoice and be glad because great is your reward in heaven for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you you are the salt of the earth but if the salt loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled by men you are the light of the world a city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl instead they put it on its stand and it gives light to everyone in the house in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and praise your father in heaven do not think that i have come to abolish the law or the prophets i have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them i tell you the truth until heaven and earth disappear not the smallest letter not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear from the law until everything is accomplished anyone who breaks one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven but whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven for i tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the pharisees and the teachers of the law you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not murder and anyone who murders will be subject to judgment but i tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment again anyone who says to his brother raca is answerable to the sanhedrin but anyone who says you fool will be in danger of the fire of hell therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your gift there in front of the altar first go and be reconciled to your brother then come and offer your gift settle matters quickly with your adversary who is taking you to court do it while you are still with him on the way or he may hand you over to the judge and the judge may hand you over to the officer and you may be thrown into prison i tell you the truth you will not get out until you have paid the last penny you have heard that it was said do not commit adultery but i tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart if your right eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell and if your right hand causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell it has been said anyone who divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce but i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness causes her to become an adulteress and anyone who marries the divorced woman commits adultery again you have heard that it was said to the people long ago do not break your oath but keep the oaths you have made to the lord but i tell you do not swear at all either by heaven for it is gods throne or by the earth for it is his footstool or by jerusalem for it is the city of the great king and do not swear by your head for you cannot make even one hair white or black simply let your yes be yes and your nono anything beyond this comes from the evil one you have heard that it was said eye for eye and tooth for tooth but i tell you do not resist an evil person if someone strikes you on the right cheek turn to him the other also and if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic let him have your cloak as well if someone forces you to go one mile go with him two miles give to the one who asks you and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you you have heard that it was said love your neighbor and hate your enemy but i tell you love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you that you may be sons of your father in heaven he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous if you love those who love you what reward will you get are not even the tax collectors doing that and if you greet only your brothers what are you doing more than others do not even pagans do that be perfect therefore as your heavenly father is perfect be careful not to do your acts of righteousness before men to be seen by them if you do you will have no reward from your father in heaven so when you give to the needy do not announce it with trumpets as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets to be honored by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full but when you give to the needy do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing so that your giving may be in secret then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you and when you pray do not be like the hypocrites for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the street corners to be seen by men i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full but when you pray go into your room close the door and pray to your father who is unseen then your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you and when you pray do not keep on babbling like pagans for they think they will be heard because of their many words do not be like them for your father knows what you need before you ask him this then is how you should pray our father in heaven hallowed be your name your kingdom come your will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us today our daily bread forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from the evil one for if you forgive men when they sin against you your heavenly father will also forgive you but if you do not forgive men their sins your father will not forgive your sins when you fast do not look somber as the hypocrites do for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting i tell you the truth they have received their reward in full but when you fast put oil on your head and wash your face so that it will not be obvious to men that you are fasting but only to your father who is unseen and your father who sees what is done in secret will reward you do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven where moth and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also the eye is the lamp of the body if your eyes are good your whole body will be full of light but if your eyes are bad your whole body will be full of darkness if then the light within you is darkness how great is that darkness no one can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or drink or about your body what you will wear is not life more important than food and the body more important than clothes look at the birds of the air they do not sow or reap or store away in barns and yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not much more valuable than they who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life and why do you worry about clothes see how the lilies of the field grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you that not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire will he not much more clothe you o you of little faith so do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for the pagans run after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them but seek first his kingdom and his righteousness and all these things will be given to you as well therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about itself each day has enough trouble of its own do not judge or you too will be judged for in the same way you judge others you will be judged and with the measure you use it will be measured to you why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye how can you say to your brother let me take the speck out of your eye when all the time there is a plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye do not give dogs what is sacred do not throw your pearls to pigs if you do they may trample them under their feet and then turn and tear you to pieces ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened which of you if his son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will give him a snake if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him so in everything do to others what you would have them do to you for this sums up the law and the prophets enter through the narrow gate for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction and many enter through it but small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life and only a few find it watch out for false prophets they come to you in sheeps clothing but inwardly they are ferocious wolves by their fruit you will recognize them do people pick grapes from thornbushes or figs from thistles likewise every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit a good tree cannot bear bad fruit and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire thus by their fruit you will recognize them not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven but only he who does the will of my father who is in heaven many will say to me on that day lord lord did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles then i will tell them plainly i never knew you away from me you evildoers therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house yet it did not fall because it had its foundation on the rock but everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand the rain came down the streams rose and the winds blew and beat against that house and it fell with a great crash when jesus had finished saying these things the crowds were amazed at his teaching because he taught as one who had authority and not as their teachers of the law when he came down from the mountainside large crowds followed him a man with leprosy came and knelt before him and said lord if you are willing you can make me clean jesus reached out his hand and touched the man i am willing he said be clean immediately he was cured of his leprosy then jesus said to him see that you dont tell anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the gift moses commanded as a testimony to them when jesus had entered capernaum a centurion came to him asking for help lord he said my servant lies at home paralyzed and in terrible suffering jesus said to him i will go and heal him the centurion replied lord i do not deserve to have you come under my roof but just say the word and my servant will be healed for i myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me i tell this one go and he goes and that one come and he comes i say to my servant do this and he does it when jesus heard this he was astonished and said to those following him i tell you the truth i have not found anyone in israel with such great faith i say to you that many will come from the east and the west and will take their places at the feast with abraham isaac and jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth then jesus said to the centurion go it will be done just as you believed it would and his servant was healed at that very hour when jesus came into peters house he saw peters mother in law lying in bed with a fever he touched her hand and the fever left her and she got up and began to wait on him when evening came many who were demon possessed were brought to him and he drove out the spirits with a word and healed all the sick this was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet isaiah he took up our infirmities and carried our diseases when jesus saw the crowd around him he gave orders to cross to the other side of the lake then a teacher of the law came to him and said teacher i will follow you wherever you go jesus replied foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head another disciple said to him lord first let me go and bury my father but jesus told him follow me and let the dead bury their own dead then he got into the boat and his disciples followed him without warning a furious storm came up on the lake so that the waves swept over the boat but jesus was sleeping the disciples went and woke him saying lord save us were going to drown he replied you of little faith why are you so afraid then he got up and rebuked the winds and the waves and it was completely calm the men were amazed and asked what kind of man is this even the winds and the waves obey him when he arrived at the other side in the region of the gadarenes two demon possessed men coming from the tombs met him they were so violent that no one could pass that way what do you want with us son of god they shouted have you come here to torture us before the appointed time some distance from them a large herd of pigs was feeding the demons begged jesus if you drive us out send us into the herd of pigs he said to them go so they came out and went into the pigs and the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and died in the water those tending the pigs ran off went into the town and reported all this including what had happened to the demon possessed men then the whole town went out to meet jesus and when they saw him they pleaded with him to leave their region jesus stepped into a boat crossed over and came to his own town some men brought to him a paralytic lying on a mat when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic take heart son your sins are forgiven at this some of the teachers of the law said to themselves this fellow is blaspheming knowing their thoughts jesus said why do you entertain evil thoughts in your hearts which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say get up and walk but so that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins then he said to the paralytic get up take your mat and go home and the man got up and went home when the crowd saw this they were filled with awe and they praised god who had given such authority to men as jesus went on from there he saw a man named matthew sitting at the tax collectors booth follow me he told him and matthew got up and followed him while jesus was having dinner at matthews house many tax collectors and sinners came and ate with him and his disciples when the pharisees saw this they asked his disciples why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners on hearing this jesus said it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick but go and learn what this means i desire mercy not sacrifice for i have not come to call the righteous but sinners then johns disciples came and asked him how is it that we and the pharisees fast but your disciples do not fast jesus answered how can the guests of the bridegroom mourn while he is with them the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them then they will fast no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment for the patch will pull away from the garment making the tear worse neither do men pour new wine into old wineskins if they do the skins will burst the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined no they pour new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved while he was saying this a ruler came and knelt before him and said my daughter has just died but come and put your hand on her and she will live jesus got up and went with him and so did his disciples just then a woman who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak she said to herself if i only touch his cloak i will be healed jesus turned and saw her take heart daughter he said your faith has healed you and the woman was healed from that moment when jesus entered the rulers house and saw the flute players and the noisy crowd he said go away the girl is not dead but asleep but they laughed at him after the crowd had been put outside he went in and took the girl by the hand and she got up news of this spread through all that region as jesus went on from there two blind men followed him calling out have mercy on us son of david when he had gone indoors the blind men came to him and he asked them do you believe that i am able to do thisyes lord they replied then he touched their eyes and said according to your faith will it be done to you and their sight was restored jesus warned them sternly see that no one knows about this but they went out and spread the news about him all over that region while they were going out a man who was demon possessed and could not talk was brought to jesus and when the demon was driven out the man who had been mute spoke the crowd was amazed and said nothing like this has ever been seen in israel but the pharisees said it is by the prince of demons that he drives out demons jesus went through all the towns and villages teaching in their synagogues preaching the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and sickness when he saw the crowds he had compassion on them because they were harassed and helpless like sheep without a shepherd then he said to his disciples the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few ask the lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field he called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority to drive out evil spirits and to heal every disease and sickness these are the names of the twelve apostles first simon who is called peter and his brother andrew james son of zebedee and his brother john philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the tax collector james son of alphaeus and thaddaeus simon the zealot and judas iscariot who betrayed him these twelve jesus sent out with the following instructions do not go among the gentiles or enter any town of the samaritans go rather to the lost sheep of israel as you go preach this message the kingdom of heaven is near heal the sick raise the dead cleanse those who have leprosy drive out demons freely you have received freely give do not take along any gold or silver or copper in your belts take no bag for the journey or extra tunic or sandals or a staff for the worker is worth his keep whatever town or village you enter search for some worthy person there and stay at his house until you leave as you enter the home give it your greeting if the home is deserving let your peace rest on it if it is not let your peace return to you if anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words shake the dust off your feet when you leave that home or town i tell you the truth it will be more bearable for sodom and gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town i am sending you out like sheep among wolves therefore be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves be on your guard against men they will hand you over to the local councils and flog you in their synagogues on my account you will be brought before governors and kings as witnesses to them and to the gentiles but when they arrest you do not worry about what to say or how to say it at that time you will be given what to say for it will not be you speaking but the spirit of your father speaking through you brother will betray brother to death and a father his child children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death all men will hate you because of me but he who stands firm to the end will be saved when you are persecuted in one place flee to another i tell you the truth you will not finish going through the cities of israel before the son of man comes a student is not above his teacher nor a servant above his master it is enough for the student to be like his teacher and the servant like his master if the head of the house has been called beelzebub how much more the members of his household so do not be afraid of them there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known what i tell you in the dark speak in the daylight what is whispered in your ear proclaim from the roofs do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul rather be afraid of the one who can destroy both soul and body in hell are not two sparrows sold for a penny yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your father and even the very hairs of your head are all numbered so dont be afraid you are worth more than many sparrows whoever acknowledges me before men i will also acknowledge him before my father in heaven but whoever disowns me before men i will disown him before my father in heaven do not suppose that i have come to bring peace to the earth i did not come to bring peace but a sword for i have come to turn a man against his father a daughter against her mother a daughter in law against her mother in law a mans enemies will be the members of his own household anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it he who receives you receives me and he who receives me receives the one who sent me anyone who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophets reward and anyone who receives a righteous man because he is a righteous man will receive a righteous mans reward and if anyone gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is my disciple i tell you the truth he will certainly not lose his reward after jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples he went on from there to teach and preach in the towns of galilee when john heard in prison what christ was doing he sent his disciples to ask him are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else jesus replied go back and report to john what you hear and see the blind receive sight the lame walk those who have leprosy are cured the deaf hear the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me as johns disciples were leaving jesus began to speak to the crowd about john what did you go out into the desert to see a reed swayed by the wind if not what did you go out to see a man dressed in fine clothes no those who wear fine clothes are in kings palaces then what did you go out to see a prophet yes i tell you and more than a prophet this is the one about whom it is written i will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you i tell you the truth among those born of women there has not risen anyone greater than john the baptist yet he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he from the days of john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing and forceful men lay hold of it for all the prophets and the law prophesied until john and if you are willing to accept it he is the elijah who was to come he who has ears let him hear to what can i compare this generation they are like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling out to others we played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not mourn for john came neither eating nor drinking and they say he has a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and they say here is a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners but wisdom is proved right by her actions then jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had been performed because they did not repent woe to you korazin woe to you bethsaida if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes but i tell you it will be more bearable for tyre and sidon on the day of judgment than for you and you capernaum will you be lifted up to the skies no you will go down to the depths if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in sodom it would have remained to this day but i tell you that it will be more bearable for sodom on the day of judgment than for you at that time jesus said i praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children yes father for this was your good pleasure all things have been committed to me by my father no one knows the son except the father and no one knows the father except the son and those to whom the son chooses to reveal him come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and humble in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light at that time jesus went through the grainfields on the sabbath his disciples were hungry and began to pick some heads of grain and eat them when the pharisees saw this they said to him look your disciples are doing what is unlawful on the sabbath he answered havent you read what david did when he and his companions were hungry he entered the house of god and he and his companions ate the consecrated bread which was not lawful for them to do but only for the priests or havent you read in the law that on the sabbath the priests in the temple desecrate the day and yet are innocent i tell you that one greater than the temple is here if you had known what these words mean i desire mercy not sacrifice you would not have condemned the innocent for the son of man is lord of the sabbath going on from that place he went into their synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there looking for a reason to accuse jesus they asked him is it lawful to heal on the sabbath he said to them if any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the sabbath will you not take hold of it and lift it out how much more valuable is a man than a sheep therefore it is lawful to do good on the sabbath then he said to the man stretch out your hand so he stretched it out and it was completely restored just as sound as the other but the pharisees went out and plotted how they might kill jesus aware of this jesus withdrew from that place many followed him and he healed all their sick warning them not to tell who he was this was to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet isaiah here is my servant whom i have chosen the one i love in whom i delight i will put my spirit on him and he will proclaim justice to the nations he will not quarrel or cry out no one will hear his voice in the streets a bruised reed he will not break and a smoldering wick he will not snuff out till he leads justice to victory in his name the nations will put their hope then they brought him a demon possessed man who was blind and mute and jesus healed him so that he could both talk and see all the people were astonished and said could this be the son of david but when the pharisees heard this they said it is only by beelzebub the prince of demons that this fellow drives out demons jesus knew their thoughts and said to them every kingdom divided against itself will be ruined and every city or household divided against itself will not stand if satan drives out satan he is divided against himself how then can his kingdom stand and if i drive out demons by beelzebub by whom do your people drive them out so then they will be your judges but if i drive out demons by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god has come upon you or again how can anyone enter a strong mans house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man then he can rob his house he who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters and so i tell you every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men but the blasphemy against the spirit will not be forgiven anyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but anyone who speaks against the holy spirit will not be forgiven either in this age or in the age to come make a tree good and its fruit will be good or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad for a tree is recognized by its fruit you brood of vipers how can you who are evil say anything good for out of the overflow of the heart the mouth speaks the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in him and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in him but i tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken for by your words you will be acquitted and by your words you will be condemned then some of the pharisees and teachers of the law said to him teacher we want to see a miraculous sign from you he answered a wicked and adulterous generation asks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of the prophet jonah for as jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of a huge fish so the son of man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth the men of nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and now one greater than jonah is here the queen of the south will rise at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to solomons wisdom and now one greater than solomon is here when an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it then it says i will return to the house i left when it arrives it finds the house unoccupied swept clean and put in order then it goes and takes with it seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there and the final condition of that man is worse than the first that is how it will be with this wicked generation while jesus was still talking to the crowd his mother and brothers stood outside wanting to speak to him someone told him your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you he replied to him who is my mother and who are my brothers pointing to his disciples he said here are my mother and my brothers for whoever does the will of my father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother that same day jesus went out of the house and sat by the lake such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it while all the people stood on the shore then he told them many things in parables saying a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil where it produced a crop a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown he who has ears let him hear the disciples came to him and asked why do you speak to the people in parables he replied the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of heaven has been given to you but not to them whoever has will be given more and he will have an abundance whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him this is why i speak to them in parables though seeing they do not see though hearing they do not hear or understand in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaiah you will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving for this peoples heart has become calloused they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and i would heal them but blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear for i tell you the truth many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it listen then to what the parable of the sower means when anyone hears the message about the kingdom and does not understand it the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart this is the seed sown along the path the one who received the seed that fell on rocky places is the man who hears the word and at once receives it with joy but since he has no root he lasts only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word he quickly falls away the one who received the seed that fell among the thorns is the man who hears the word but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke it making it unfruitful but the one who received the seed that fell on good soil is the man who hears the word and understands it he produces a crop yielding a hundred sixty or thirty times what was sown jesus told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field but while everyone was sleeping his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away when the wheat sprouted and formed heads then the weeds also appeared the owners servants came to him and said sir didnt you sow good seed in your field where then did the weeds come from an enemy did this he replied the servants asked him do you want us to go and pull them up no he answered because while you are pulling the weeds you may root up the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest at that time i will tell the harvesters first collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn he told them another parable the kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his field though it is the smallest of all your seeds yet when it grows it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and perch in its branches he told them still another parable the kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough jesus spoke all these things to the crowd in parables he did not say anything to them without using a parable so was fulfilled what was spoken through the prophet i will open my mouth in parables i will utter things hidden since the creation of the world then he left the crowd and went into the house his disciples came to him and said explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field he answered the one who sowed the good seed is the son of man the field is the world and the good seed stands for the sons of the kingdom the weeds are the sons of the evil one and the enemy who sows them is the devil the harvest is the end of the age and the harvesters are angels as the weeds are pulled up and burned in the fire so it will be at the end of the age the son of man will send out his angels and they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil they will throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father he who has ears let him hear the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field when a man found it he hid it again and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant looking for fine pearls when he found one of great value he went away and sold everything he had and bought it once again the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was let down into the lake and caught all kinds of fish when it was full the fishermen pulled it up on the shore then they sat down and collected the good fish in baskets but threw the bad away this is how it will be at the end of the age the angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous and throw them into the fiery furnace where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth have you understood all these things jesus asked yes they replied he said to them therefore every teacher of the law who has been instructed about the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his storeroom new treasures as well as old when jesus had finished these parables he moved on from there coming to his hometown he began teaching the people in their synagogue and they were amazed where did this man get this wisdom and these miraculous powers they asked isnt this the carpenters son isnt his mothers name mary and arent his brothers james joseph simon and judas arent all his sisters with us where then did this man get all these things and they took offense at him but jesus said to them only in his hometown and in his own house is a prophet without honor and he did not do many miracles there because of their lack of faith at that time herod the tetrarch heard the reports about jesus and he said to his attendants this is john the baptist he has risen from the dead that is why miraculous powers are at work in him now herod had arrested john and bound him and put him in prison because of herodias his brother philips wife for john had been saying to him it is not lawful for you to have her herod wanted to kill john but he was afraid of the people because they considered him a prophet on herods birthday the daughter of herodias danced for them and pleased herod so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked prompted by her mother she said give me here on a platter the head of john the baptist the king was distressed but because of his oaths and his dinner guests he ordered that her request be granted and had john beheaded in the prison his head was brought in on a platter and given to the girl who carried it to her mother johns disciples came and took his body and buried it then they went and told jesus when jesus heard what had happened he withdrew by boat privately to a solitary place hearing of this the crowds followed him on foot from the towns when jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them and healed their sick as evening approached the disciples came to him and said this is a remote place and its already getting late send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy themselves some food jesus replied they do not need to go away you give them something to eat we have here only five loaves of bread and two fish they answered bring them here to me he said and he directed the people to sit down on the grass taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves then he gave them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people they all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over the number of those who ate was about five thousand men besides women and children immediately jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to the other side while he dismissed the crowd after he had dismissed them he went up on a mountainside by himself to pray when evening came he was there alone but the boat was already a considerable distance from land buffeted by the waves because the wind was against it during the fourth watch of the night jesus went out to them walking on the lake when the disciples saw him walking on the lake they were terrified its a ghost they said and cried out in fear but jesus immediately said to them take courage it is i dont be afraid lord if its you peter replied tell me to come to you on the water come he said then peter got down out of the boat walked on the water and came toward jesus but when he saw the wind he was afraid and beginning to sink cried out lord save me immediately jesus reached out his hand and caught him you of little faith he said why did you doubt and when they climbed into the boat the wind died down then those who were in the boat worshiped him saying truly you are the son of god when they had crossed over they landed at gennesaret and when the men of that place recognized jesus they sent word to all the surrounding country people brought all their sick to him and begged him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak and all who touched him were healed then some pharisees and teachers of the law came to jesus from jerusalem and asked why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders they dont wash their hands before they eat jesus replied and why do you break the command of god for the sake of your tradition for god said honor your father and mother and anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death but you say that if a man says to his father or mother whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is a gift devoted to god he is not to honor his father with it thus you nullify the word of god for the sake of your tradition you hypocrites isaiah was right when he prophesied about you these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men jesus called the crowd to him and said listen and understand what goes into a mans mouth does not make him unclean but what comes out of his mouth that is what makes him unclean then the disciples came to him and asked do you know that the pharisees were offended when they heard this he replied every plant that my heavenly father has not planted will be pulled up by the roots leave them they are blind guides if a blind man leads a blind man both will fall into a pit peter said explain the parable to us are you still so dull jesus asked them dont you see that whatever enters the mouth goes into the stomach and then out of the body but the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart and these make a man unclean for out of the heart come evil thoughts murder adultery sexual immorality theft false testimony slander these are what make a man unclean but eating with unwashed hands does not make him unclean leaving that place jesus withdrew to the region of tyre and sidon a canaanite woman from that vicinity came to him crying out lord son of david have mercy on me my daughter is suffering terribly from demon possession jesus did not answer a word so his disciples came to him and urged him send her away for she keeps crying out after us he answered i was sent only to the lost sheep of israel the woman came and knelt before him lord help me she said he replied it is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to their dogs yes lord she said but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters table then jesus answered woman you have great faith your request is granted and her daughter was healed from that very hour jesus left there and went along the sea of galilee then he went up on a mountainside and sat down great crowds came to him bringing the lame the blind the crippled the mute and many others and laid them at his feet and he healed them the people were amazed when they saw the mute speaking the crippled made well the lame walking and the blind seeing and they praised the god of israel jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion for these people they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat i do not want to send them away hungry or they may collapse on the way his disciples answered where could we get enough bread in this remote place to feed such a crowd how many loaves do you have jesus asked seven they replied and a few small fish he told the crowd to sit down on the ground then he took the seven loaves and the fish and when he had given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples and they in turn to the people they all ate and were satisfied afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over the number of those who ate was four thousand besides women and children after jesus had sent the crowd away he got into the boat and went to the vicinity of magadan the pharisees and sadducees came to jesus and tested him by asking him to show them a sign from heaven he replied when evening comes you say it will be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning today it will be stormy for the sky is red and overcast you know how to interpret the appearance of the sky but you cannot interpret the signs of the times a wicked and adulterous generation looks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of jonah jesus then left them and went away when they went across the lake the disciples forgot to take bread be careful jesus said to them be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees they discussed this among themselves and said it is because we didnt bring any bread aware of their discussion jesus asked you of little faith why are you talking among yourselves about having no bread do you still not understand dont you remember the five loaves for the five thousand and how many basketfuls you gathered or the seven loaves for the four thousand and how many basketfuls you gathered how is it you dont understand that i was not talking to you about bread but be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees and sadducees then they understood that he was not telling them to guard against the yeast used in bread but against the teaching of the pharisees and sadducees when jesus came to the region of caesarea philippi he asked his disciples who do people say the son of man is they replied some say john the baptist others say elijah and still others jeremiah or one of the prophets but what about you he asked who do you say i am simon peter answered you are the christ the son of the living god jesus replied blessed are you simon son of jonah for this was not revealed to you by man but by my father in heaven and i tell you that you are peter and on this rock i will build my church and the gates of hades will not overcome it i will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven then he warned his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the christ from that time on jesus began to explain to his disciples that he must go to jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life peter took him aside and began to rebuke him never lord he said this shall never happen to you jesus turned and said to peter get behind me satan you are a stumbling block to me you do not have in mind the things of god but the things of men then jesus said to his disciples if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will find it what good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world yet forfeits his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul for the son of man is going to come in his fathers glory with his angels and then he will reward each person according to what he has done i tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the son of man coming in his kingdom after six days jesus took with him peter james and john the brother of james and led them up a high mountain by themselves there he was transfigured before them his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light just then there appeared before them moses and elijah talking with jesus peter said to jesus lord it is good for us to be here if you wish i will put up three shelters one for you one for moses and one for elijah while he was still speaking a bright cloud enveloped them and a voice from the cloud said this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased listen to him when the disciples heard this they fell facedown to the ground terrified but jesus came and touched them get up he said dont be afraid when they looked up they saw no one except jesus as they were coming down the mountain jesus instructed them dont tell anyone what you have seen until the son of man has been raised from the dead the disciples asked him why then do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come first jesus replied to be sure elijah comes and will restore all things but i tell you elijah has already come and they did not recognize him but have done to him everything they wished in the same way the son of man is going to suffer at their hands then the disciples understood that he was talking to them about john the baptist when they came to the crowd a man approached jesus and knelt before him lord have mercy on my son he said he has seizures and is suffering greatly he often falls into the fire or into the water i brought him to your disciples but they could not heal him o unbelieving and perverse generation jesus replied how long shall i stay with you how long shall i put up with you bring the boy here to me jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of the boy and he was healed from that moment then the disciples came to jesus in private and asked why couldnt we drive it out he replied because you have so little faith i tell you the truth if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move nothing will be impossible for you see footnote when they came together in galilee he said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men they will kill him and on the third day he will be raised to life and the disciples were filled with grief after jesus and his disciples arrived in capernaum the collectors of the two drachma tax came to peter and asked doesnt your teacher pay the temple tax yes he does he replied when peter came into the house jesus was the first to speak what do you think simon he asked from whom do the kings of the earth collect duty and taxes from their own sons or from others from others peter answered then the sons are exempt jesus said to him but so that we may not offend them go to the lake and throw out your line take the first fish you catch open its mouth and you will find a four drachma coin take it and give it to them for my tax and yours at that time the disciples came to jesus and asked who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven he called a little child and had him stand among them and he said i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven therefore whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me but if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin such things must come but woe to the man through whom they come if your hand or your foot causes you to sin cut it off and throw it away it is better for you to enter life maimed or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire and if your eye causes you to sin gouge it out and throw it away it is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell see that you do not look down on one of these little ones for i tell you that their angels in heaven always see the face of my father in heaven see footnote what do you think if a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away will he not leave the ninety nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off and if he finds it i tell you the truth he is happier about that one sheep than about the ninety nine that did not wander off in the same way your father in heaven is not willing that any of these little ones should be lost if your brother sins against you go and show him his fault just between the two of you if he listens to you you have won your brother over but if he will not listen take one or two others along so that every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses if he refuses to listen to them tell it to the church and if he refuses to listen even to the church treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector i tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven again i tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for it will be done for you by my father in heaven for where two or three come together in my name there am i with them then peter came to jesus and asked lord how many times shall i forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times jesus answered i tell you not seven times but seventy seven times therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants as he began the settlement a man who owed him ten thousand talents was brought to him since he was not able to pay the master ordered that he and his wife and his children and all that he had be sold to repay the debt the servant fell on his knees before him be patient with me he begged and i will pay back everything the servants master took pity on him canceled the debt and let him go but when that servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii he grabbed him and began to choke him pay back what you owe me he demanded his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back but he refused instead he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt when the other servants saw what had happened they were greatly distressed and went and told their master everything that had happened then the master called the servant in you wicked servant he said i canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to shouldnt you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as i had on you in anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured until he should pay back all he owed this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart when jesus had finished saying these things he left galilee and went into the region of judea to the other side of the jordan large crowds followed him and he healed them there some pharisees came to him to test him they asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason havent you read he replied that at the beginning the creator made them male and female and said for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate why then they asked did moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away jesus replied moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard but it was not this way from the beginning i tell you that anyone who divorces his wife except for marital unfaithfulness and marries another woman commits adultery the disciples said to him if this is the situation between a husband and wife it is better not to marry jesus replied not everyone can accept this word but only those to whom it has been given for some are eunuchs because they were born that way others were made that way by men and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven the one who can accept this should accept it then little children were brought to jesus for him to place his hands on them and pray for them but the disciples rebuked those who brought them jesus said let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these when he had placed his hands on them he went on from there now a man came up to jesus and asked teacher what good thing must i do to get eternal life why do you ask me about what is good jesus replied there is only one who is good if you want to enter life obey the commandments which ones the man inquired jesus replied do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not give false testimony honor your father and mother and love your neighbor as yourself all these i have kept the young man said what do i still lack jesus answered if you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me when the young man heard this he went away sad because he had great wealth then jesus said to his disciples i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god when the disciples heard this they were greatly astonished and asked who then can be saved jesus looked at them and said with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible peter answered him we have left everything to follow you what then will there be for us jesus said to them i tell you the truth at the renewal of all things when the son of man sits on his glorious throne you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel and everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for my sake will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life but many who are first will be last and many who are last will be first for the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire men to work in his vineyard he agreed to pay them a denarius for the day and sent them into his vineyard about the third hour he went out and saw others standing in the marketplace doing nothing he told them you also go and work in my vineyard and i will pay you whatever is right so they went he went out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour and did the same thing about the eleventh hour he went out and found still others standing around he asked them why have you been standing here all day long doing nothing because no one has hired us they answered he said to them you also go and work in my vineyard when evening came the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman call the workers and pay them their wages beginning with the last ones hired and going on to the first the workers who were hired about the eleventh hour came and each received a denarius so when those came who were hired first they expected to receive more but each one of them also received a denarius when they received it they began to grumble against the landowner these men who were hired last worked only one hour they said and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the work and the heat of the day but he answered one of them friend i am not being unfair to you didnt you agree to work for a denarius take your pay and go i want to give the man who was hired last the same as i gave you dont i have the right to do what i want with my own money or are you envious because i am generous so the last will be first and the first will be last now as jesus was going up to jerusalem he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them we are going up to jerusalem and the son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and the teachers of the law they will condemn him to death and will turn him over to the gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified on the third day he will be raised to life then the mother of zebedees sons came to jesus with her sons and kneeling down asked a favor of him what is it you want he asked she said grant that one of these two sons of mine may sit at your right and the other at your left in your kingdom you dont know what you are asking jesus said to them can you drink the cup i am going to drinkwe can they answered jesus said to them you will indeed drink from my cup but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant these places belong to those for whom they have been prepared by my father when the ten heard about this they were indignant with the two brothers jesus called them together and said you know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be your slave just as the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many as jesus and his disciples were leaving jericho a large crowd followed him two blind men were sitting by the roadside and when they heard that jesus was going by they shouted lord son of david have mercy on us the crowd rebuked them and told them to be quiet but they shouted all the louder lord son of david have mercy on us jesus stopped and called them what do you want me to do for you he asked lord they answered we want our sight jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes immediately they received their sight and followed him as they approached jerusalem and came to bethphage on the mount of olives jesus sent two disciples saying to them go to the village ahead of you and at once you will find a donkey tied there with her colt by her untie them and bring them to me if anyone says anything to you tell him that the lord needs them and he will send them right away this took place to fulfill what was spoken through the prophet say to the daughter of zion see your king comes to you gentle and riding on a donkey on a colt the foal of a donkey the disciples went and did as jesus had instructed them they brought the donkey and the colt placed their cloaks on them and jesus sat on them a very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road while others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed shouted hosanna to the son of davidblessed is he who comes in the name of the lordhosanna in the highest when jesus entered jerusalem the whole city was stirred and asked who is this the crowds answered this is jesus the prophet from nazareth in galilee jesus entered the temple area and drove out all who were buying and selling there he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves it is written he said to them my house will be called a house of prayer but you are making it a den of robbers the blind and the lame came to him at the temple and he healed them but when the chief priests and the teachers of the law saw the wonderful things he did and the children shouting in the temple area hosanna to the son of david they were indignant do you hear what these children are saying they asked him yes replied jesus have you never read from the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise and he left them and went out of the city to bethany where he spent the night early in the morning as he was on his way back to the city he was hungry seeing a fig tree by the road he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves then he said to it may you never bear fruit again immediately the tree withered when the disciples saw this they were amazed how did the fig tree wither so quickly they asked jesus replied i tell you the truth if you have faith and do not doubt not only can you do what was done to the fig tree but also you can say to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and it will be done if you believe you will receive whatever you ask for in prayer jesus entered the temple courts and while he was teaching the chief priests and the elders of the people came to him by what authority are you doing these things they asked and who gave you this authority jesus replied i will also ask you one question if you answer me i will tell you by what authority i am doing these things johns baptism where did it come from was it from heaven or from men they discussed it among themselves and said if we say from heaven he will ask then why didnt you believe him but if we say from men we are afraid of the people for they all hold that john was a prophet so they answered jesus we dont know then he said neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things what do you think there was a man who had two sons he went to the first and said son go and work today in the vineyard i will not he answered but later he changed his mind and went then the father went to the other son and said the same thing he answered i will sir but he did not go which of the two did what his father wantedthe first they answered jesus said to them i tell you the truth the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering the kingdom of god ahead of you for john came to you to show you the way of righteousness and you did not believe him but the tax collectors and the prostitutes did and even after you saw this you did not repent and believe him listen to another parable there was a landowner who planted a vineyard he put a wall around it dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey when the harvest time approached he sent his servants to the tenants to collect his fruit the tenants seized his servants they beat one killed another and stoned a third then he sent other servants to them more than the first time and the tenants treated them the same way last of all he sent his son to them they will respect my son he said but when the tenants saw the son they said to each other this is the heir come lets kill him and take his inheritance so they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him therefore when the owner of the vineyard comes what will he do to those tenants he will bring those wretches to a wretched end they replied and he will rent the vineyard to other tenants who will give him his share of the crop at harvest time jesus said to them have you never read in the scriptures the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone the lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes therefore i tell you that the kingdom of god will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce its fruit he who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom it falls will be crushed when the chief priests and the pharisees heard jesus parables they knew he was talking about them they looked for a way to arrest him but they were afraid of the crowd because the people held that he was a prophet jesus spoke to them again in parables saying the kingdom of heaven is like a king who prepared a wedding banquet for his son he sent his servants to those who had been invited to the banquet to tell them to come but they refused to come then he sent some more servants and said tell those who have been invited that i have prepared my dinner my oxen and fattened cattle have been butchered and everything is ready come to the wedding banquet but they paid no attention and went off one to his field another to his business the rest seized his servants mistreated them and killed them the king was enraged he sent his army and destroyed those murderers and burned their city then he said to his servants the wedding banquet is ready but those i invited did not deserve to come go to the street corners and invite to the banquet anyone you find so the servants went out into the streets and gathered all the people they could find both good and bad and the wedding hall was filled with guests but when the king came in to see the guests he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes friend he asked how did you get in here without wedding clothes the man was speechless then the king told the attendants tie him hand and foot and throw him outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are invited but few are chosen then the pharisees went out and laid plans to trap him in his words they sent their disciples to him along with the herodians teacher they said we know you are a man of integrity and that you teach the way of god in accordance with the truth you arent swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are tell us then what is your opinion is it right to pay taxes to caesar or not but jesus knowing their evil intent said you hypocrites why are you trying to trap me show me the coin used for paying the tax they brought him a denarius and he asked them whose portrait is this and whose inscription caesars they replied then he said to them give to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods when they heard this they were amazed so they left him and went away that same day the sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question teacher they said moses told us that if a man dies without having children his brother must marry the widow and have children for him now there were seven brothers among us the first one married and died and since he had no children he left his wife to his brother the same thing happened to the second and third brother right on down to the seventh finally the woman died now then at the resurrection whose wife will she be of the seven since all of them were married to her jesus replied you are in error because you do not know the scriptures or the power of god at the resurrection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage they will be like the angels in heaven but about the resurrection of the dead have you not read what god said to you i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living when the crowds heard this they were astonished at his teaching hearing that jesus had silenced the sadducees the pharisees got together one of them an expert in the law tested him with this question teacher which is the greatest commandment in the law jesus replied love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind this is the first and greatest commandment and the second is like it love your neighbor as yourself all the law and the prophets hang on these two commandments while the pharisees were gathered together jesus asked them what do you think about the christ whose son is hethe son of david they replied he said to them how is it then that david speaking by the spirit calls him lord for he says the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet if then david calls him lord how can he be his son no one could say a word in reply and from that day on no one dared to ask him any more questions then jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples the teachers of the law and the pharisees sit in moses seat so you must obey them and do everything they tell you but do not do what they do for they do not practice what they preach they tie up heavy loads and put them on mens shoulders but they themselves are not willing to lift a finger to move them everything they do is done for men to see they make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long they love the place of honor at banquets and the most important seats in the synagogues they love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have men call them rabbi but you are not to be called rabbi for you have only one master and you are all brothers and do not call anyone on earth father for you have one father and he is in heaven nor are you to be called teacher for you have one teacher the christ the greatest among you will be your servant for whoever exalts himself will be humbled and whoever humbles himself will be exalted woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you shut the kingdom of heaven in mens faces you yourselves do not enter nor will you let those enter who are trying to see footnote woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you travel over land and sea to win a single convert and when he becomes one you make him twice as much a son of hell as you are woe to you blind guides you say if anyone swears by the temple it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple he is bound by his oath you blind fools which is greater the gold or the temple that makes the gold sacred you also say if anyone swears by the altar it means nothing but if anyone swears by the gift on it he is bound by his oath you blind men which is greater the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred therefore he who swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it and he who swears by the temple swears by it and by the one who dwells in it and he who swears by heaven swears by gods throne and by the one who sits on it woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you give a tenth of your spices mint dill and cummin but you have neglected the more important matters of the law justice mercy and faithfulness you should have practiced the latter without neglecting the former you blind guides you strain out a gnat but swallow a camel woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you clean the outside of the cup and dish but inside they are full of greed and self indulgence blind pharisee first clean the inside of the cup and dish and then the outside also will be clean woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you are like whitewashed tombs which look beautiful on the outside but on the inside are full of dead mens bones and everything unclean in the same way on the outside you appear to people as righteous but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and wickedness woe to you teachers of the law and pharisees you hypocrites you build tombs for the prophets and decorate the graves of the righteous and you say if we had lived in the days of our forefathers we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets so you testify against yourselves that you are the descendants of those who murdered the prophets fill up then the measure of the sin of your forefathers you snakes you brood of vipers how will you escape being condemned to hell therefore i am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers some of them you will kill and crucify others you will flog in your synagogues and pursue from town to town and so upon you will come all the righteous blood that has been shed on earth from the blood of righteous abel to the blood of zechariah son of berekiah whom you murdered between the temple and the altar i tell you the truth all this will come upon this generation o jerusalem jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you how often i have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing look your house is left to you desolate for i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord jesus left the temple and was walking away when his disciples came up to him to call his attention to its buildings do you see all these things he asked i tell you the truth not one stone here will be left on another every one will be thrown down as jesus was sitting on the mount of olives the disciples came to him privately tell us they said when will this happen and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age jesus answered watch out that no one deceives you for many will come in my name claiming i am the christ and will deceive many you will hear of wars and rumors of wars but see to it that you are not alarmed such things must happen but the end is still to come nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be famines and earthquakes in various places all these are the beginning of birth pains then you will be handed over to be persecuted and put to death and you will be hated by all nations because of me at that time many will turn away from the faith and will betray and hate each other and many false prophets will appear and deceive many people because of the increase of wickedness the love of most will grow cold but he who stands firm to the end will be saved and this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come so when you see standing in the holy place the abomination that causes desolation spoken of through the prophet daniel let the reader understand then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains let no one on the roof of his house go down to take anything out of the house let no one in the field go back to get his cloak how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers pray that your flight will not take place in winter or on the sabbath for then there will be great distress unequaled from the beginning of the world until now and never to be equaled again if those days had not been cut short no one would survive but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened at that time if anyone says to you look here is the christ or there he is do not believe it for false christs and false prophets will appear and perform great signs and miracles to deceive even the elect if that were possible see i have told you ahead of time so if anyone tells you there he is out in the desert do not go out or here he is in the inner rooms do not believe it for as lightning that comes from the east is visible even in the west so will be the coming of the son of man wherever there is a carcass there the vultures will gather immediately after the distress of those days the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken at that time the sign of the son of man will appear in the sky and all the nations of the earth will mourn they will see the son of man coming on the clouds of the sky with power and great glory and he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call and they will gather his elect from the four winds from one end of the heavens to the other now learn this lesson from the fig tree as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out you know that summer is near even so when you see all these things you know that it is near right at the door i tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away no one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father as it was in the days of noah so it will be at the coming of the son of man for in the days before the flood people were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage up to the day noah entered the ark and they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away that is how it will be at the coming of the son of man two men will be in the field one will be taken and the other left two women will be grinding with a hand mill one will be taken and the other left therefore keep watch because you do not know on what day your lord will come but understand this if the owner of the house had known at what time of night the thief was coming he would have kept watch and would not have let his house be broken into so you also must be ready because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him who then is the faithful and wise servant whom the master has put in charge of the servants in his household to give them their food at the proper time it will be good for that servant whose master finds him doing so when he returns i tell you the truth he will put him in charge of all his possessions but suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself my master is staying away a long time and he then begins to beat his fellow servants and to eat and drink with drunkards the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth at that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom five of them were foolish and five were wise the foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them the wise however took oil in jars along with their lamps the bridegroom was a long time in coming and they all became drowsy and fell asleep at midnight the cry rang out heres the bridegroom come out to meet him then all the virgins woke up and trimmed their lamps the foolish ones said to the wise give us some of your oil our lamps are going out no they replied there may not be enough for both us and you instead go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves but while they were on their way to buy the oil the bridegroom arrived the virgins who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet and the door was shut later the others also came sir sir they said open the door for us but he replied i tell you the truth i dont know you therefore keep watch because you do not know the day or the hour again it will be like a man going on a journey who called his servants and entrusted his property to them to one he gave five talents of money to another two talents and to another one talent each according to his ability then he went on his journey the man who had received the five talents went at once and put his money to work and gained five more so also the one with the two talents gained two more but the man who had received the one talent went off dug a hole in the ground and hid his masters money after a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them the man who had received the five talents brought the other five master he said you entrusted me with five talents see i have gained five more his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness the man with the two talents also came master he said you entrusted me with two talents see i have gained two more his master replied well done good and faithful servant you have been faithful with a few things i will put you in charge of many things come and share your masters happiness then the man who had received the one talent came master he said i knew that you are a hard man harvesting where you have not sown and gathering where you have not scattered seed so i was afraid and went out and hid your talent in the ground see here is what belongs to you his master replied you wicked lazy servant so you knew that i harvest where i have not sown and gather where i have not scattered seed well then you should have put my money on deposit with the bankers so that when i returned i would have received it back with interest take the talent from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents for everyone who has will be given more and he will have an abundance whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him and throw that worthless servant outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory all the nations will be gathered before him and he will separate the people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats he will put the sheep on his right and the goats on his left then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world for i was hungry and you gave me something to eat i was thirsty and you gave me something to drink i was a stranger and you invited me in i needed clothes and you clothed me i was sick and you looked after me i was in prison and you came to visit me then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels for i was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat i was thirsty and you gave me nothing to drink i was a stranger and you did not invite me in i needed clothes and you did not clothe me i was sick and in prison and you did not look after me they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life when jesus had finished saying all these things he said to his disciples as you know the passover is two days away and the son of man will be handed over to be crucified then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest whose name was caiaphas and they plotted to arrest jesus in some sly way and kill him but not during the feast they said or there may be a riot among the people while jesus was in bethany in the home of a man known as simon the leper a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume which she poured on his head as he was reclining at the table when the disciples saw this they were indignant why this waste they asked this perfume could have been sold at a high price and the money given to the poor aware of this jesus said to them why are you bothering this woman she has done a beautiful thing to me the poor you will always have with you but you will not always have me when she poured this perfume on my body she did it to prepare me for burial i tell you the truth wherever this gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also be told in memory of her then one of the twelve the one called judas iscariot went to the chief priests and asked what are you willing to give me if i hand him over to you so they counted out for him thirty silver coins from then on judas watched for an opportunity to hand him over on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to jesus and asked where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the passover he replied go into the city to a certain man and tell him the teacher says my appointed time is near i am going to celebrate the passover with my disciples at your house so the disciples did as jesus had directed them and prepared the passover when evening came jesus was reclining at the table with the twelve and while they were eating he said i tell you the truth one of you will betray me they were very sad and began to say to him one after the other surely not i lord jesus replied the one who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me the son of man will go just as it is written about him but woe to that man who betrays the son of man it would be better for him if he had not been born then judas the one who would betray him said surely not i rabbi jesus answered yes it is you while they were eating jesus took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take and eat this is my body then he took the cup gave thanks and offered it to them saying drink from it all of you this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins i tell you i will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when i drink it anew with you in my fathers kingdom when they had sung a hymn they went out to the mount of olives then jesus told them this very night you will all fall away on account of me for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered but after i have risen i will go ahead of you into galilee peter replied even if all fall away on account of you i never will i tell you the truth jesus answered this very night before the rooster crows you will disown me three times but peter declared even if i have to die with you i will never disown you and all the other disciples said the same then jesus went with his disciples to a place called gethsemane and he said to them sit here while i go over there and pray he took peter and the two sons of zebedee along with him and he began to be sorrowful and troubled then he said to them my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death stay here and keep watch with me going a little farther he fell with his face to the ground and prayed my father if it is possible may this cup be taken from me yet not as i will but as you will then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping could you men not keep watch with me for one hour he asked peter watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation the spirit is willing but the body is weak he went away a second time and prayed my father if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless i drink it may your will be done when he came back he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy so he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time saying the same thing then he returned to the disciples and said to them are you still sleeping and resting look the hour is near and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us go here comes my betrayer while he was still speaking judas one of the twelve arrived with him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them the one i kiss is the man arrest him going at once to jesus judas said greetings rabbi and kissed him jesus replied friend do what you came for then the men stepped forward seized jesus and arrested him with that one of jesus companions reached for his sword drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his ear put your sword back in its place jesus said to him for all who draw the sword will die by the sword do you think i cannot call on my father and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels but how then would the scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way at that time jesus said to the crowd am i leading a rebellion that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me every day i sat in the temple courts teaching and you did not arrest me but this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled then all the disciples deserted him and fled those who had arrested jesus took him to caiaphas the high priest where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled but peter followed him at a distance right up to the courtyard of the high priest he entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome the chief priests and the whole sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against jesus so that they could put him to death but they did not find any though many false witnesses came forward finally two came forward and declared this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and rebuild it in three days then the high priest stood up and said to jesus are you not going to answer what is this testimony that these men are bringing against you but jesus remained silent the high priest said to him i charge you under oath by the living god tell us if you are the christ the son of god yes it is as you say jesus replied but i say to all of you in the future you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven then the high priest tore his clothes and said he has spoken blasphemy why do we need any more witnesses look now you have heard the blasphemy what do you thinkhe is worthy of death they answered then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists others slapped him and said prophesy to us christ who hit you now peter was sitting out in the courtyard and a servant girl came to him you also were with jesus of galilee she said but he denied it before them all i dont know what youre talking about he said then he went out to the gateway where another girl saw him and said to the people there this fellow was with jesus of nazareth he denied it again with an oath i dont know the man after a little while those standing there went up to peter and said surely you are one of them for your accent gives you away then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them i dont know the man immediately a rooster crowed then peter remembered the word jesus had spoken before the rooster crows you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly early in the morning all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put jesus to death they bound him led him away and handed him over to pilate the governor when judas who had betrayed him saw that jesus was condemned he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders i have sinned he said for i have betrayed innocent bloodwhat is that to us they replied thats your responsibility so judas threw the money into the temple and left then he went away and hanged himself the chief priests picked up the coins and said it is against the law to put this into the treasury since it is blood money so they decided to use the money to buy the potters field as a burial place for foreigners that is why it has been called the field of blood to this day then what was spoken by jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled they took the thirty silver coins the price set on him by the people of israel and they used them to buy the potters field as the lord commanded me meanwhile jesus stood before the governor and the governor asked him are you the king of the jewsyes it is as you say jesus replied when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders he gave no answer then pilate asked him dont you hear the testimony they are bringing against you but jesus made no reply not even to a single charge to the great amazement of the governor now it was the governors custom at the feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd at that time they had a notorious prisoner called barabbas so when the crowd had gathered pilate asked them which one do you want me to release to you barabbas or jesus who is called christ for he knew it was out of envy that they had handed jesus over to him while pilate was sitting on the judges seat his wife sent him this message dont have anything to do with that innocent man for i have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him but the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for barabbas and to have jesus executed which of the two do you want me to release to you asked the governor barabbas they answered what shall i do then with jesus who is called christ pilate asked they all answered crucify him why what crime has he committed asked pilate but they shouted all the louder crucify him when pilate saw that he was getting nowhere but that instead an uproar was starting he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd i am innocent of this mans blood he said it is your responsibility all the people answered let his blood be on us and on our children then he released barabbas to them but he had jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified then the governors soldiers took jesus into the praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head they put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him hail king of the jews they said they spit on him and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again after they had mocked him they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him then they led him away to crucify him as they were going out they met a man from cyrene named simon and they forced him to carry the cross they came to a place called golgotha which means the place of the skull there they offered jesus wine to drink mixed with gall but after tasting it he refused to drink it when they had crucified him they divided up his clothes by casting lots and sitting down they kept watch over him there above his head they placed the written charge against him this is jesus the king of the jews two robbers were crucified with him one on his right and one on his left those who passed by hurled insults at him shaking their heads and saying you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days save yourself come down from the cross if you are the son of god in the same way the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him he saved others they said but he cant save himself hes the king of israel let him come down now from the cross and we will believe in him he trusts in god let god rescue him now if he wants him for he said i am the son of god in the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him from the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land about the ninth hour jesus cried out in a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which means my god my god why have you forsaken me when some of those standing there heard this they said hes calling elijah immediately one of them ran and got a sponge he filled it with wine vinegar put it on a stick and offered it to jesus to drink the rest said now leave him alone lets see if elijah comes to save him and when jesus had cried out again in a loud voice he gave up his spirit at that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom the earth shook and the rocks split the tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life they came out of the tombs and after jesus resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people when the centurion and those with him who were guarding jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened they were terrified and exclaimed surely he was the son of god many women were there watching from a distance they had followed jesus from galilee to care for his needs among them were mary magdalene mary the mother of james and joses and the mother of zebedees sons as evening approached there came a rich man from arimathea named joseph who had himself become a disciple of jesus going to pilate he asked for jesus body and pilate ordered that it be given to him joseph took the body wrapped it in a clean linen cloth and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock he rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away mary magdalene and the other mary were sitting there opposite the tomb the next day the one after preparation day the chief priests and the pharisees went to pilate sir they said we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said after three days i will rise again so give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day otherwise his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead this last deception will be worse than the first take a guard pilate answered go make the tomb as secure as you know how so they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard after the sabbath at dawn on the first day of the week mary magdalene and the other mary went to look at the tomb there was a violent earthquake for an angel of the lord came down from heaven and going to the tomb rolled back the stone and sat on it his appearance was like lightning and his clothes were white as snow the guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men the angel said to the women do not be afraid for i know that you are looking for jesus who was crucified he is not here he has risen just as he said come and see the place where he lay then go quickly and tell his disciples he has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into galilee there you will see him now i have told you so the women hurried away from the tomb afraid yet filled with joy and ran to tell his disciples suddenly jesus met them greetings he said they came to him clasped his feet and worshiped him then jesus said to them do not be afraid go and tell my brothers to go to galilee there they will see me while the women were on their way some of the guards went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened when the chief priests had met with the elders and devised a plan they gave the soldiers a large sum of money telling them you are to say his disciples came during the night and stole him away while we were asleep if this report gets to the governor we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble so the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed and this story has been widely circulated among the jews to this very day then the eleven disciples went to galilee to the mountain where jesus had told them to go when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubted then jesus came to them and said all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me therefore go and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit and teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you and surely i am with you always to the very end of the age  the beginning of the gospel about jesus christ the son of god it is written in isaiah the prophet i will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way a voice of one calling in the desert prepare the way for the lord make straight paths for him and so john came baptizing in the desert region and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins the whole judean countryside and all the people of jerusalem went out to him confessing their sins they were baptized by him in the jordan river john wore clothing made of camels hair with a leather belt around his waist and he ate locusts and wild honey and this was his message after me will come one more powerful than i the thongs of whose sandals i am not worthy to stoop down and untie i baptize you with water but he will baptize you with the holy spirit at that time jesus came from nazareth in galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan as jesus was coming up out of the water he saw heaven being torn open and the spirit descending on him like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my son whom i love with you i am well pleased at once the spirit sent him out into the desert and he was in the desert forty days being tempted by satan he was with the wild animals and angels attended him after john was put in prison jesus went into galilee proclaiming the good news of god the time has come he said the kingdom of god is near repent and believe the good news as jesus walked beside the sea of galilee he saw simon and his brother andrew casting a net into the lake for they were fishermen come follow me jesus said and i will make you fishers of men at once they left their nets and followed him when he had gone a little farther he saw james son of zebedee and his brother john in a boat preparing their nets without delay he called them and they left their father zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him they went to capernaum and when the sabbath came jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach the people were amazed at his teaching because he taught them as one who had authority not as the teachers of the law just then a man in their synagogue who was possessed by an evil spirit cried out what do you want with us jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you are the holy one of god be quiet said jesus sternly come out of him the evil spirit shook the man violently and came out of him with a shriek the people were all so amazed that they asked each other what is this a new teaching and with authority he even gives orders to evil spirits and they obey him news about him spread quickly over the whole region of galilee as soon as they left the synagogue they went with james and john to the home of simon and andrew simons mother in law was in bed with a fever and they told jesus about her so he went to her took her hand and helped her up the fever left her and she began to wait on them that evening after sunset the people brought to jesus all the sick and demon possessed the whole town gathered at the door and jesus healed many who had various diseases he also drove out many demons but he would not let the demons speak because they knew who he was very early in the morning while it was still dark jesus got up left the house and went off to a solitary place where he prayed simon and his companions went to look for him and when they found him they exclaimed everyone is looking for you jesus replied let us go somewhere else to the nearby villages so i can preach there also that is why i have come so he traveled throughout galilee preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons a man with leprosy came to him and begged him on his knees if you are willing you can make me clean filled with compassion jesus reached out his hand and touched the man i am willing he said be clean immediately the leprosy left him and he was cured jesus sent him away at once with a strong warning see that you dont tell this to anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that moses commanded for your cleansing as a testimony to them instead he went out and began to talk freely spreading the news as a result jesus could no longer enter a town openly but stayed outside in lonely places yet the people still came to him from everywhere a few days later when jesus again entered capernaum the people heard that he had come home so many gathered that there was no room left not even outside the door and he preached the word to them some men came bringing to him a paralytic carried by four of them since they could not get him to jesus because of the crowd they made an opening in the roof above jesus and after digging through it lowered the mat the paralyzed man was lying on when jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic son your sins are forgiven now some teachers of the law were sitting there thinking to themselves why does this fellow talk like that hes blaspheming who can forgive sins but god alone immediately jesus knew in his spirit that this was what they were thinking in their hearts and he said to them why are you thinking these things which is easier to say to the paralytic your sins are forgiven or to say get up take your mat and walk but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralytic i tell you get up take your mat and go home he got up took his mat and walked out in full view of them all this amazed everyone and they praised god saying we have never seen anything like this once again jesus went out beside the lake a large crowd came to him and he began to teach them as he walked along he saw levi son of alphaeus sitting at the tax collectors booth follow me jesus told him and levi got up and followed him while jesus was having dinner at levis house many tax collectors and sinners were eating with him and his disciples for there were many who followed him when the teachers of the law who were pharisees saw him eating with the sinners and tax collectors they asked his disciples why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners on hearing this jesus said to them it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners now johns disciples and the pharisees were fasting some people came and asked jesus how is it that johns disciples and the disciples of the pharisees are fasting but yours are not jesus answered how can the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them they cannot so long as they have him with them but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them and on that day they will fast no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment if he does the new piece will pull away from the old making the tear worse and no one pours new wine into old wineskins if he does the wine will burst the skins and both the wine and the wineskins will be ruined no he pours new wine into new wineskins one sabbath jesus was going through the grainfields and as his disciples walked along they began to pick some heads of grain the pharisees said to him look why are they doing what is unlawful on the sabbath he answered have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry and in need in the days of abiathar the high priest he entered the house of god and ate the consecrated bread which is lawful only for priests to eat and he also gave some to his companions then he said to them the sabbath was made for man not man for the sabbath so the son of man is lord even of the sabbath another time he went into the synagogue and a man with a shriveled hand was there some of them were looking for a reason to accuse jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal him on the sabbath jesus said to the man with the shriveled hand stand up in front of everyone then jesus asked them which is lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to kill but they remained silent he looked around at them in anger and deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts said to the man stretch out your hand he stretched it out and his hand was completely restored then the pharisees went out and began to plot with the herodians how they might kill jesus jesus withdrew with his disciples to the lake and a large crowd from galilee followed when they heard all he was doing many people came to him from judea jerusalem idumea and the regions across the jordan and around tyre and sidon because of the crowd he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him to keep the people from crowding him for he had healed many so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him whenever the evil spirits saw him they fell down before him and cried out you are the son of god but he gave them strict orders not to tell who he was jesus went up on a mountainside and called to him those he wanted and they came to him he appointed twelve designating them apostles that they might be with him and that he might send them out to preach and to have authority to drive out demons these are the twelve he appointed simon to whom he gave the name peter james son of zebedee and his brother john to them he gave the name boanerges which means sons of thunder andrew philip bartholomew matthew thomas james son of alphaeus thaddaeus simon the zealot and judas iscariot who betrayed him then jesus entered a house and again a crowd gathered so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat when his family heard about this they went to take charge of him for they said he is out of his mind and the teachers of the law who came down from jerusalem said he is possessed by beelzebub by the prince of demons he is driving out demons so jesus called them and spoke to them in parables how can satan drive out satan if a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand if a house is divided against itself that house cannot stand and if satan opposes himself and is divided he cannot stand his end has come in fact no one can enter a strong mans house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man then he can rob his house i tell you the truth all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them but whoever blasphemes against the holy spirit will never be forgiven he is guilty of an eternal sin he said this because they were saying he has an evil spirit then jesus mother and brothers arrived standing outside they sent someone in to call him a crowd was sitting around him and they told him your mother and brothers are outside looking for you who are my mother and my brothers he asked then he looked at those seated in a circle around him and said here are my mother and my brothers whoever does gods will is my brother and sister and mother again jesus began to teach by the lake the crowd that gathered around him was so large that he got into a boat and sat in it out on the lake while all the people were along the shore at the waters edge he taught them many things by parables and in his teaching said listen a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path and the birds came and ate it up some fell on rocky places where it did not have much soil it sprang up quickly because the soil was shallow but when the sun came up the plants were scorched and they withered because they had no root other seed fell among thorns which grew up and choked the plants so that they did not bear grain still other seed fell on good soil it came up grew and produced a crop multiplying thirty sixty or even a hundred times then jesus said he who has ears to hear let him hear when he was alone the twelve and the others around him asked him about the parables he told them the secret of the kingdom of god has been given to you but to those on the outside everything is said in parables so that they may be ever seeing but never perceiving and ever hearing but never understanding otherwise they might turn and be forgiven then jesus said to them dont you understand this parable how then will you understand any parable the farmer sows the word some people are like seed along the path where the word is sown as soon as they hear it satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them others like seed sown on rocky places hear the word and at once receive it with joy but since they have no root they last only a short time when trouble or persecution comes because of the word they quickly fall away still others like seed sown among thorns hear the word but the worries of this life the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word making it unfruitful others like seed sown on good soil hear the word accept it and produce a crop thirty sixty or even a hundred times what was sown he said to them do you bring in a lamp to put it under a bowl or a bed instead dont you put it on its stand for whatever is hidden is meant to be disclosed and whatever is concealed is meant to be brought out into the open if anyone has ears to hear let him hear consider carefully what you hear he continued with the measure you use it will be measured to you and even more whoever has will be given more whoever does not have even what he has will be taken from him he also said this is what the kingdom of god is like a man scatters seed on the ground night and day whether he sleeps or gets up the seed sprouts and grows though he does not know how all by itself the soil produces grain first the stalk then the head then the full kernel in the head as soon as the grain is ripe he puts the sickle to it because the harvest has come again he said what shall we say the kingdom of god is like or what parable shall we use to describe it it is like a mustard seed which is the smallest seed you plant in the ground yet when planted it grows and becomes the largest of all garden plants with such big branches that the birds of the air can perch in its shade with many similar parables jesus spoke the word to them as much as they could understand he did not say anything to them without using a parable but when he was alone with his own disciples he explained everything that day when evening came he said to his disciples let us go over to the other side leaving the crowd behind they took him along just as he was in the boat there were also other boats with him a furious squall came up and the waves broke over the boat so that it was nearly swamped jesus was in the stern sleeping on a cushion the disciples woke him and said to him teacher dont you care if we drown he got up rebuked the wind and said to the waves quiet be still then the wind died down and it was completely calm he said to his disciples why are you so afraid do you still have no faith they were terrified and asked each other who is this even the wind and the waves obey him they went across the lake to the region of the gerasenes when jesus got out of the boat a man with an evil spirit came from the tombs to meet him this man lived in the tombs and no one could bind him any more not even with a chain for he had often been chained hand and foot but he tore the chains apart and broke the irons on his feet no one was strong enough to subdue him night and day among the tombs and in the hills he would cry out and cut himself with stones when he saw jesus from a distance he ran and fell on his knees in front of him he shouted at the top of his voice what do you want with me jesus son of the most high god swear to god that you wont torture me for jesus had said to him come out of this man you evil spirit then jesus asked him what is your name my name is legion he replied for we are many and he begged jesus again and again not to send them out of the area a large herd of pigs was feeding on the nearby hillside the demons begged jesus send us among the pigs allow us to go into them he gave them permission and the evil spirits came out and went into the pigs the herd about two thousand in number rushed down the steep bank into the lake and were drowned those tending the pigs ran off and reported this in the town and countryside and the people went out to see what had happened when they came to jesus they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons sitting there dressed and in his right mind and they were afraid those who had seen it told the people what had happened to the demon possessed man and told about the pigs as well then the people began to plead with jesus to leave their region as jesus was getting into the boat the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him jesus did not let him but said go home to your family and tell them how much the lord has done for you and how he has had mercy on you so the man went away and began to tell in the decapolis how much jesus had done for him and all the people were amazed when jesus had again crossed over by boat to the other side of the lake a large crowd gathered around him while he was by the lake then one of the synagogue rulers named jairus came there seeing jesus he fell at his feet and pleaded earnestly with him my little daughter is dying please come and put your hands on her so that she will be healed and live so jesus went with him a large crowd followed and pressed around him and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years she had suffered a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all she had yet instead of getting better she grew worse when she heard about jesus she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak because she thought if i just touch his clothes i will be healed immediately her bleeding stopped and she felt in her body that she was freed from her suffering at once jesus realized that power had gone out from him he turned around in the crowd and asked who touched my clothes you see the people crowding against you his disciples answered and yet you can ask who touched me but jesus kept looking around to see who had done it then the woman knowing what had happened to her came and fell at his feet and trembling with fear told him the whole truth he said to her daughter your faith has healed you go in peace and be freed from your suffering while jesus was still speaking some men came from the house of jairus the synagogue ruler your daughter is dead they said why bother the teacher any more ignoring what they said jesus told the synagogue ruler dont be afraid just believe he did not let anyone follow him except peter james and john the brother of james when they came to the home of the synagogue ruler jesus saw a commotion with people crying and wailing loudly he went in and said to them why all this commotion and wailing the child is not dead but asleep but they laughed at him after he put them all out he took the childs father and mother and the disciples who were with him and went in where the child was he took her by the hand and said to her talitha koum which means little girl i say to you get up  immediately the girl stood up and walked around she was twelve years old at this they were completely astonished he gave strict orders not to let anyone know about this and told them to give her something to eat jesus left there and went to his hometown accompanied by his disciples when the sabbath came he began to teach in the synagogue and many who heard him were amazed where did this man get these things they asked whats this wisdom that has been given him that he even does miracles isnt this the carpenter isnt this marys son and the brother of james joseph judas and simon arent his sisters here with us and they took offense at him jesus said to them only in his hometown among his relatives and in his own house is a prophet without honor he could not do any miracles there except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them and he was amazed at their lack of faith then jesus went around teaching from village to village calling the twelve to him he sent them out two by two and gave them authority over evil spirits these were his instructions take nothing for the journey except a staff no bread no bag no money in your belts wear sandals but not an extra tunic whenever you enter a house stay there until you leave that town and if any place will not welcome you or listen to you shake the dust off your feet when you leave as a testimony against them they went out and preached that people should repent they drove out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them king herod heard about this for jesus name had become well known some were saying john the baptist has been raised from the dead and that is why miraculous powers are at work in him others said he is elijah and still others claimed he is a prophet like one of the prophets of long ago but when herod heard this he said john the man i beheaded has been raised from the dead for herod himself had given orders to have john arrested and he had him bound and put in prison he did this because of herodias his brother philips wife whom he had married for john had been saying to herod it is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife so herodias nursed a grudge against john and wanted to kill him but she was not able to because herod feared john and protected him knowing him to be a righteous and holy man when herod heard john he was greatly puzzled yet he liked to listen to him finally the opportune time came on his birthday herod gave a banquet for his high officials and military commanders and the leading men of galilee when the daughter of herodias came in and danced she pleased herod and his dinner guests the king said to the girl ask me for anything you want and ill give it to you and he promised her with an oath whatever you ask i will give you up to half my kingdom she went out and said to her mother what shall i ask forthe head of john the baptist she answered at once the girl hurried in to the king with the request i want you to give me right now the head of john the baptist on a platter the king was greatly distressed but because of his oaths and his dinner guests he did not want to refuse her so he immediately sent an executioner with orders to bring johns head the man went beheaded john in the prison and brought back his head on a platter he presented it to the girl and she gave it to her mother on hearing of this johns disciples came and took his body and laid it in a tomb the apostles gathered around jesus and reported to him all they had done and taught then because so many people were coming and going that they did not even have a chance to eat he said to them come with me by yourselves to a quiet place and get some rest so they went away by themselves in a boat to a solitary place but many who saw them leaving recognized them and ran on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them when jesus landed and saw a large crowd he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd so he began teaching them many things by this time it was late in the day so his disciples came to him this is a remote place they said and its already very late send the people away so they can go to the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat but he answered you give them something to eat they said to him that would take eight months of a mans wages are we to go and spend that much on bread and give it to them to eat how many loaves do you have he asked go and see when they found out they said five and two fish then jesus directed them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass so they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves then he gave them to his disciples to set before the people he also divided the two fish among them all they all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces of bread and fish the number of the men who had eaten was five thousand immediately jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead of him to bethsaida while he dismissed the crowd after leaving them he went up on a mountainside to pray when evening came the boat was in the middle of the lake and he was alone on land he saw the disciples straining at the oars because the wind was against them about the fourth watch of the night he went out to them walking on the lake he was about to pass by them but when they saw him walking on the lake they thought he was a ghost they cried out because they all saw him and were terrified immediately he spoke to them and said take courage it is i dont be afraid then he climbed into the boat with them and the wind died down they were completely amazed for they had not understood about the loaves their hearts were hardened when they had crossed over they landed at gennesaret and anchored there as soon as they got out of the boat people recognized jesus they ran throughout that whole region and carried the sick on mats to wherever they heard he was and wherever he went into villages towns or countryside they placed the sick in the marketplaces they begged him to let them touch even the edge of his cloak and all who touched him were healed the pharisees and some of the teachers of the law who had come from jerusalem gathered around jesus and saw some of his disciples eating food with hands that were unclean that is unwashed the pharisees and all the jews do not eat unless they give their hands a ceremonial washing holding to the tradition of the elders when they come from the marketplace they do not eat unless they wash and they observe many other traditions such as the washing of cups pitchers and kettles  so the pharisees and teachers of the law asked jesus why dont your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders instead of eating their food with unclean hands he replied isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites as it is written these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me they worship me in vain their teachings are but rules taught by men you have let go of the commands of god and are holding on to the traditions of men and he said to them you have a fine way of setting aside the commands of god in order to observe your own traditions for moses said honor your father and your mother and anyone who curses his father or mother must be put to death but you say that if a man says to his father or mother whatever help you might otherwise have received from me is corban that is a gift devoted to god then you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother thus you nullify the word of god by your tradition that you have handed down and you do many things like that again jesus called the crowd to him and said listen to me everyone and understand this nothing outside a man can make him unclean by going into him rather it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean see footnote after he had left the crowd and entered the house his disciples asked him about this parable are you so dull he asked dont you see that nothing that enters a man from the outside can make him unclean for it doesnt go into his heart but into his stomach and then out of his body in saying this jesus declared all foods clean he went on what comes out of a man is what makes him unclean for from within out of mens hearts come evil thoughts sexual immorality theft murder adultery greed malice deceit lewdness envy slander arrogance and folly all these evils come from inside and make a man unclean jesus left that place and went to the vicinity of tyre he entered a house and did not want anyone to know it yet he could not keep his presence secret in fact as soon as she heard about him a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit came and fell at his feet the woman was a greek born in syrian phoenicia she begged jesus to drive the demon out of her daughter first let the children eat all they want he told her for it is not right to take the childrens bread and toss it to their dogs yes lord she replied but even the dogs under the table eat the childrens crumbs then he told her for such a reply you may go the demon has left your daughter she went home and found her child lying on the bed and the demon gone then jesus left the vicinity of tyre and went through sidon down to the sea of galilee and into the region of the decapolis there some people brought to him a man who was deaf and could hardly talk and they begged him to place his hand on the man after he took him aside away from the crowd jesus put his fingers into the mans ears then he spit and touched the mans tongue he looked up to heaven and with a deep sigh said to him ephphatha which means be opened  at this the mans ears were opened his tongue was loosened and he began to speak plainly jesus commanded them not to tell anyone but the more he did so the more they kept talking about it people were overwhelmed with amazement he has done everything well they said he even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak during those days another large crowd gathered since they had nothing to eat jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion for these people they have already been with me three days and have nothing to eat if i send them home hungry they will collapse on the way because some of them have come a long distance his disciples answered but where in this remote place can anyone get enough bread to feed them how many loaves do you have jesus asked seven they replied he told the crowd to sit down on the ground when he had taken the seven loaves and given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people and they did so they had a few small fish as well he gave thanks for them also and told the disciples to distribute them the people ate and were satisfied afterward the disciples picked up seven basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over about four thousand men were present and having sent them away he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the region of dalmanutha the pharisees came and began to question jesus to test him they asked him for a sign from heaven he sighed deeply and said why does this generation ask for a miraculous sign i tell you the truth no sign will be given to it then he left them got back into the boat and crossed to the other side the disciples had forgotten to bring bread except for one loaf they had with them in the boat be careful jesus warned them watch out for the yeast of the pharisees and that of herod they discussed this with one another and said it is because we have no bread aware of their discussion jesus asked them why are you talking about having no bread do you still not see or understand are your hearts hardened do you have eyes but fail to see and ears but fail to hear and dont you remember when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick uptwelve they replied and when i broke the seven loaves for the four thousand how many basketfuls of pieces did you pick up they answered seven he said to them do you still not understand they came to bethsaida and some people brought a blind man and begged jesus to touch him he took the blind man by the hand and led him outside the village when he had spit on the mans eyes and put his hands on him jesus asked do you see anything he looked up and said i see people they look like trees walking around once more jesus put his hands on the mans eyes then his eyes were opened his sight was restored and he saw everything clearly jesus sent him home saying dont go into the village jesus and his disciples went on to the villages around caesarea philippi on the way he asked them who do people say i am they replied some say john the baptist others say elijah and still others one of the prophets but what about you he asked who do you say i am peter answered you are the christ jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him he then began to teach them that the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and that he must be killed and after three days rise again he spoke plainly about this and peter took him aside and began to rebuke him but when jesus turned and looked at his disciples he rebuked peter get behind me satan he said you do not have in mind the things of god but the things of men then he called the crowd to him along with his disciples and said if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it what good is it for a man to gain the whole world yet forfeit his soul or what can a man give in exchange for his soul if anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his fathers glory with the holy angels and he said to them i tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god come with power after six days jesus took peter james and john with him and led them up a high mountain where they were all alone there he was transfigured before them his clothes became dazzling white whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them and there appeared before them elijah and moses who were talking with jesus peter said to jesus rabbi it is good for us to be here let us put up three shelters one for you one for moses and one for elijah he did not know what to say they were so frightened then a cloud appeared and enveloped them and a voice came from the cloud this is my son whom i love listen to him suddenly when they looked around they no longer saw anyone with them except jesus as they were coming down the mountain jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the son of man had risen from the dead they kept the matter to themselves discussing what rising from the dead meant and they asked him why do the teachers of the law say that elijah must come first jesus replied to be sure elijah does come first and restores all things why then is it written that the son of man must suffer much and be rejected but i tell you elijah has come and they have done to him everything they wished just as it is written about him when they came to the other disciples they saw a large crowd around them and the teachers of the law arguing with them as soon as all the people saw jesus they were overwhelmed with wonder and ran to greet him what are you arguing with them about he asked a man in the crowd answered teacher i brought you my son who is possessed by a spirit that has robbed him of speech whenever it seizes him it throws him to the ground he foams at the mouth gnashes his teeth and becomes rigid i asked your disciples to drive out the spirit but they could not o unbelieving generation jesus replied how long shall i stay with you how long shall i put up with you bring the boy to me so they brought him when the spirit saw jesus it immediately threw the boy into a convulsion he fell to the ground and rolled around foaming at the mouth jesus asked the boys father how long has he been like this from childhood he answered it has often thrown him into fire or water to kill him but if you can do anything take pity on us and help us if you can said jesus everything is possible for him who believes immediately the boys father exclaimed i do believe help me overcome my unbelief when jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene he rebuked the evil spirit you deaf and mute spirit he said i command you come out of him and never enter him again the spirit shrieked convulsed him violently and came out the boy looked so much like a corpse that many said hes dead but jesus took him by the hand and lifted him to his feet and he stood up after jesus had gone indoors his disciples asked him privately why couldnt we drive it out he replied this kind can come out only by prayer they left that place and passed through galilee jesus did not want anyone to know where they were because he was teaching his disciples he said to them the son of man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men they will kill him and after three days he will rise but they did not understand what he meant and were afraid to ask him about it they came to capernaum when he was in the house he asked them what were you arguing about on the road but they kept quiet because on the way they had argued about who was the greatest sitting down jesus called the twelve and said if anyone wants to be first he must be the very last and the servant of all he took a little child and had him stand among them taking him in his arms he said to them whoever welcomes one of these little children in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me does not welcome me but the one who sent me teacher said john we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we told him to stop because he was not one of us do not stop him jesus said no one who does a miracle in my name can in the next moment say anything bad about me for whoever is not against us is for us i tell you the truth anyone who gives you a cup of water in my name because you belong to christ will certainly not lose his reward and if anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck if your hand causes you to sin cut it off it is better for you to enter life maimed than with two hands to go into hell where the fire never goes out see footnote and if your foot causes you to sin cut it off it is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell see footnote and if your eye causes you to sin pluck it out it is better for you to enter the kingdom of god with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched everyone will be salted with fire salt is good but if it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again have salt in yourselves and be at peace with each other jesus then left that place and went into the region of judea and across the jordan again crowds of people came to him and as was his custom he taught them some pharisees came and tested him by asking is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife what did moses command you he replied they said moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away it was because your hearts were hard that moses wrote you this law jesus replied but at the beginning of creation god made them male and female for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh so they are no longer two but one therefore what god has joined together let man not separate when they were in the house again the disciples asked jesus about this he answered anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her and if she divorces her husband and marries another man she commits adultery people were bringing little children to jesus to have him touch them but the disciples rebuked them when jesus saw this he was indignant he said to them let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it and he took the children in his arms put his hands on them and blessed them as jesus started on his way a man ran up to him and fell on his knees before him good teacher he asked what must i do to inherit eternal life why do you call me good jesus answered no one is good except god alone you know the commandments do not murder do not commit adultery do not steal do not give false testimony do not defraud honor your father and mother teacher he declared all these i have kept since i was a boy jesus looked at him and loved him one thing you lack he said go sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me at this the mans face fell he went away sad because he had great wealth jesus looked around and said to his disciples how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god the disciples were amazed at his words but jesus said again children how hard it is to enter the kingdom of god it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god the disciples were even more amazed and said to each other who then can be saved jesus looked at them and said with man this is impossible but not with god all things are possible with god peter said to him we have left everything to follow you i tell you the truth jesus replied no one who has left home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel will fail to receive a hundred times as much in this present age homes brothers sisters mothers children and fields and with them persecutions and in the age to come eternal life but many who are first will be last and the last first they were on their way up to jerusalem with jesus leading the way and the disciples were astonished while those who followed were afraid again he took the twelve aside and told them what was going to happen to him we are going up to jerusalem he said and the son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and teachers of the law they will condemn him to death and will hand him over to the gentiles who will mock him and spit on him flog him and kill him three days later he will rise then james and john the sons of zebedee came to him teacher they said we want you to do for us whatever we ask what do you want me to do for you he asked they replied let one of us sit at your right and the other at your left in your glory you dont know what you are asking jesus said can you drink the cup i drink or be baptized with the baptism i am baptized with we can they answered jesus said to them you will drink the cup i drink and be baptized with the baptism i am baptized with but to sit at my right or left is not for me to grant these places belong to those for whom they have been prepared when the ten heard about this they became indignant with james and john jesus called them together and said you know that those who are regarded as rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their high officials exercise authority over them not so with you instead whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first must be slave of all for even the son of man did not come to be served but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many then they came to jericho as jesus and his disciples together with a large crowd were leaving the city a blind man bartimaeus that is the son of timaeus was sitting by the roadside begging when he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to shout jesus son of david have mercy on me many rebuked him and told him to be quiet but he shouted all the more son of david have mercy on me jesus stopped and said call him so they called to the blind man cheer up on your feet hes calling you throwing his cloak aside he jumped to his feet and came to jesus what do you want me to do for you jesus asked him the blind man said rabbi i want to see go said jesus your faith has healed you immediately he received his sight and followed jesus along the road as they approached jerusalem and came to bethphage and bethany at the mount of olives jesus sent two of his disciples saying to them go to the village ahead of you and just as you enter it you will find a colt tied there which no one has ever ridden untie it and bring it here if anyone asks you why are you doing this tell him the lord needs it and will send it back here shortly they went and found a colt outside in the street tied at a doorway as they untied it some people standing there asked what are you doing untying that colt they answered as jesus had told them to and the people let them go when they brought the colt to jesus and threw their cloaks over it he sat on it many people spread their cloaks on the road while others spread branches they had cut in the fields those who went ahead and those who followed shouted hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord blessed is the coming kingdom of our father davidhosanna in the highest jesus entered jerusalem and went to the temple he looked around at everything but since it was already late he went out to bethany with the twelve the next day as they were leaving bethany jesus was hungry seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf he went to find out if it had any fruit when he reached it he found nothing but leaves because it was not the season for figs then he said to the tree may no one ever eat fruit from you again and his disciples heard him say it on reaching jerusalem jesus entered the temple area and began driving out those who were buying and selling there he overturned the tables of the money changers and the benches of those selling doves and would not allow anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts and as he taught them he said is it not written my house will be called a house of prayer for all nations but you have made it a den of robbers the chief priests and the teachers of the law heard this and began looking for a way to kill him for they feared him because the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching when evening came they went out of the city in the morning as they went along they saw the fig tree withered from the roots peter remembered and said to jesus rabbi look the fig tree you cursed has withered have faith in god jesus answered i tell you the truth if anyone says to this mountain go throw yourself into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen it will be done for him therefore i tell you whatever you ask for in prayer believe that you have received it and it will be yours and when you stand praying if you hold anything against anyone forgive him so that your father in heaven may forgive you your sins see footnote they arrived again in jerusalem and while jesus was walking in the temple courts the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders came to him by what authority are you doing these things they asked and who gave you authority to do this jesus replied i will ask you one question answer me and i will tell you by what authority i am doing these things johns baptism was it from heaven or from men tell me they discussed it among themselves and said if we say from heaven he will ask then why didnt you believe him but if we say from men they feared the people for everyone held that john really was a prophet so they answered jesus we dont know jesus said neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things he then began to speak to them in parables a man planted a vineyard he put a wall around it dug a pit for the winepress and built a watchtower then he rented the vineyard to some farmers and went away on a journey at harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants to collect from them some of the fruit of the vineyard but they seized him beat him and sent him away empty handed then he sent another servant to them they struck this man on the head and treated him shamefully he sent still another and that one they killed he sent many others some of them they beat others they killed he had one left to send a son whom he loved he sent him last of all saying they will respect my son but the tenants said to one another this is the heir come lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours so they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard what then will the owner of the vineyard do he will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others havent you read this scripture the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone the lord has done this and it is marvelous in our eyes then they looked for a way to arrest him because they knew he had spoken the parable against them but they were afraid of the crowd so they left him and went away later they sent some of the pharisees and herodians to jesus to catch him in his words they came to him and said teacher we know you are a man of integrity you arent swayed by men because you pay no attention to who they are but you teach the way of god in accordance with the truth is it right to pay taxes to caesar or not should we pay or shouldnt we but jesus knew their hypocrisy why are you trying to trap me he asked bring me a denarius and let me look at it they brought the coin and he asked them whose portrait is this and whose inscriptioncaesars they replied then jesus said to them give to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods and they were amazed at him then the sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to him with a question teacher they said moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother now there were seven brothers the first one married and died without leaving any children the second one married the widow but he also died leaving no child it was the same with the third in fact none of the seven left any children last of all the woman died too at the resurrection whose wife will she be since the seven were married to her jesus replied are you not in error because you do not know the scriptures or the power of god when the dead rise they will neither marry nor be given in marriage they will be like the angels in heaven now about the dead rising have you not read in the book of moses in the account of the bush how god said to him i am the god of abraham the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living you are badly mistaken one of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating noticing that jesus had given them a good answer he asked him of all the commandments which is the most important the most important one answered jesus is this hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this love your neighbor as yourself there is no commandment greater than these well said teacher the man replied you are right in saying that god is one and there is no other but him to love him with all your heart with all your understanding and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices when jesus saw that he had answered wisely he said to him you are not far from the kingdom of god and from then on no one dared ask him any more questions while jesus was teaching in the temple courts he asked how is it that the teachers of the law say that the christ is the son of david david himself speaking by the holy spirit declared the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i put your enemies under your feet david himself calls him lord how then can he be his son the large crowd listened to him with delight as he taught jesus said watch out for the teachers of the law they like to walk around in flowing robes and be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for a show make lengthy prayers such men will be punished most severely jesus sat down opposite the place where the offerings were put and watched the crowd putting their money into the temple treasury many rich people threw in large amounts but a poor widow came and put in two very small copper coins worth only a fraction of a penny calling his disciples to him jesus said i tell you the truth this poor widow has put more into the treasury than all the others they all gave out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in everything all she had to live on as he was leaving the temple one of his disciples said to him look teacher what massive stones what magnificent buildings do you see all these great buildings replied jesus not one stone here will be left on another every one will be thrown down as jesus was sitting on the mount of olives opposite the temple peter james john and andrew asked him privately tell us when will these things happen and what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled jesus said to them watch out that no one deceives you many will come in my name claiming i am he and will deceive many when you hear of wars and rumors of wars do not be alarmed such things must happen but the end is still to come nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be earthquakes in various places and famines these are the beginning of birth pains you must be on your guard you will be handed over to the local councils and flogged in the synagogues on account of me you will stand before governors and kings as witnesses to them and the gospel must first be preached to all nations whenever you are arrested and brought to trial do not worry beforehand about what to say just say whatever is given you at the time for it is not you speaking but the holy spirit brother will betray brother to death and a father his child children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death all men will hate you because of me but he who stands firm to the end will be saved when you see the abomination that causes desolation standing where it does not belong let the reader understand then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains let no one on the roof of his house go down or enter the house to take anything out let no one in the field go back to get his cloak how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers pray that this will not take place in winter because those will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning when god created the world until now and never to be equaled again if the lord had not cut short those days no one would survive but for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen he has shortened them at that time if anyone says to you look here is the christ or look there he is do not believe it for false christs and false prophets will appear and perform signs and miracles to deceive the elect if that were possible so be on your guard i have told you everything ahead of time but in those days following that distress the sun will be darkened and the moon will not give its light the stars will fall from the sky and the heavenly bodies will be shaken at that time men will see the son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory and he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens now learn this lesson from the fig tree as soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out you know that summer is near even so when you see these things happening you know that it is near right at the door i tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away no one knows about that day or hour not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father be on guard be alert you do not know when that time will come its like a man going away he leaves his house and puts his servants in charge each with his assigned task and tells the one at the door to keep watch therefore keep watch because you do not know when the owner of the house will come back whether in the evening or at midnight or when the rooster crows or at dawn if he comes suddenly do not let him find you sleeping what i say to you i say to everyone watch now the passover and the feast of unleavened bread were only two days away and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some sly way to arrest jesus and kill him but not during the feast they said or the people may riot while he was in bethany reclining at the table in the home of a man known as simon the leper a woman came with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made of pure nard she broke the jar and poured the perfume on his head some of those present were saying indignantly to one another why this waste of perfume it could have been sold for more than a years wages and the money given to the poor and they rebuked her harshly leave her alone said jesus why are you bothering her she has done a beautiful thing to me the poor you will always have with you and you can help them any time you want but you will not always have me she did what she could she poured perfume on my body beforehand to prepare for my burial i tell you the truth wherever the gospel is preached throughout the world what she has done will also be told in memory of her then judas iscariot one of the twelve went to the chief priests to betray jesus to them they were delighted to hear this and promised to give him money so he watched for an opportunity to hand him over on the first day of the feast of unleavened bread when it was customary to sacrifice the passover lamb jesus disciples asked him where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the passover so he sent two of his disciples telling them go into the city and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him say to the owner of the house he enters the teacher asks where is my guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready make preparations for us there the disciples left went into the city and found things just as jesus had told them so they prepared the passover when evening came jesus arrived with the twelve while they were reclining at the table eating he said i tell you the truth one of you will betray me one who is eating with me they were saddened and one by one they said to him surely not i it is one of the twelve he replied one who dips bread into the bowl with me the son of man will go just as it is written about him but woe to that man who betrays the son of man it would be better for him if he had not been born while they were eating jesus took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to his disciples saying take it this is my body then he took the cup gave thanks and offered it to them and they all drank from it this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many he said to them i tell you the truth i will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when i drink it anew in the kingdom of god when they had sung a hymn they went out to the mount of olives you will all fall away jesus told them for it is written i will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered but after i have risen i will go ahead of you into galilee peter declared even if all fall away i will not i tell you the truth jesus answered today yes tonight before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times but peter insisted emphatically even if i have to die with you i will never disown you and all the others said the same they went to a place called gethsemane and jesus said to his disciples sit here while i pray he took peter james and john along with him and he began to be deeply distressed and troubled my soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death he said to them stay here and keep watch going a little farther he fell to the ground and prayed that if possible the hour might pass from him abba father he said everything is possible for you take this cup from me yet not what i will but what you will then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping simon he said to peter are you asleep could you not keep watch for one hour watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation the spirit is willing but the body is weak once more he went away and prayed the same thing when he came back he again found them sleeping because their eyes were heavy they did not know what to say to him returning the third time he said to them are you still sleeping and resting enough the hour has come look the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners rise let us go here comes my betrayer just as he was speaking judas one of the twelve appeared with him was a crowd armed with swords and clubs sent from the chief priests the teachers of the law and the elders now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them the one i kiss is the man arrest him and lead him away under guard going at once to jesus judas said rabbi and kissed him the men seized jesus and arrested him then one of those standing near drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his ear am i leading a rebellion said jesus that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me every day i was with you teaching in the temple courts and you did not arrest me but the scriptures must be fulfilled then everyone deserted him and fled a young man wearing nothing but a linen garment was following jesus when they seized him he fled naked leaving his garment behind they took jesus to the high priest and all the chief priests elders and teachers of the law came together peter followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest there he sat with the guards and warmed himself at the fire the chief priests and the whole sanhedrin were looking for evidence against jesus so that they could put him to death but they did not find any many testified falsely against him but their statements did not agree then some stood up and gave this false testimony against him we heard him say i will destroy this man made temple and in three days will build another not made by man yet even then their testimony did not agree then the high priest stood up before them and asked jesus are you not going to answer what is this testimony that these men are bringing against you but jesus remained silent and gave no answer again the high priest asked him are you the christ the son of the blessed one i am said jesus and you will see the son of man sitting at the right hand of the mighty one and coming on the clouds of heaven the high priest tore his clothes why do we need any more witnesses he asked you have heard the blasphemy what do you think they all condemned him as worthy of death then some began to spit at him they blindfolded him struck him with their fists and said prophesy and the guards took him and beat him while peter was below in the courtyard one of the servant girls of the high priest came by when she saw peter warming himself she looked closely at him you also were with that nazarene jesus she said but he denied it i dont know or understand what youre talking about he said and went out into the entryway when the servant girl saw him there she said again to those standing around this fellow is one of them again he denied it after a little while those standing near said to peter surely you are one of them for you are a galilean he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them i dont know this man youre talking about immediately the rooster crowed the second time then peter remembered the word jesus had spoken to him before the rooster crows twice you will disown me three times and he broke down and wept very early in the morning the chief priests with the elders the teachers of the law and the whole sanhedrin reached a decision they bound jesus led him away and handed him over to pilate are you the king of the jews asked pilate yes it is as you say jesus replied the chief priests accused him of many things so again pilate asked him arent you going to answer see how many things they are accusing you of but jesus still made no reply and pilate was amazed now it was the custom at the feast to release a prisoner whom the people requested a man called barabbas was in prison with the insurrectionists who had committed murder in the uprising the crowd came up and asked pilate to do for them what he usually did do you want me to release to you the king of the jews asked pilate knowing it was out of envy that the chief priests had handed jesus over to him but the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have pilate release barabbas instead what shall i do then with the one you call the king of the jews pilate asked them crucify him they shouted why what crime has he committed asked pilate but they shouted all the louder crucify him wanting to satisfy the crowd pilate released barabbas to them he had jesus flogged and handed him over to be crucified the soldiers led jesus away into the palace that is the praetorium and called together the whole company of soldiers they put a purple robe on him then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on him and they began to call out to him hail king of the jews again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him falling on their knees they paid homage to him and when they had mocked him they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him then they led him out to crucify him a certain man from cyrene simon the father of alexander and rufus was passing by on his way in from the country and they forced him to carry the cross they brought jesus to the place called golgotha which means the place of the skull then they offered him wine mixed with myrrh but he did not take it and they crucified him dividing up his clothes they cast lots to see what each would get it was the third hour when they crucified him the written notice of the charge against him read the king of the jews they crucified two robbers with him one on his right and one on his left see footnote those who passed by hurled insults at him shaking their heads and saying so you who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days come down from the cross and save yourself in the same way the chief priests and the teachers of the law mocked him among themselves he saved others they said but he cant save himself let this christ this king of israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe those crucified with him also heaped insults on him at the sixth hour darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour and at the ninth hour jesus cried out in a loud voice eloi eloi lama sabachthani which means my god my god why have you forsaken me when some of those standing near heard this they said listen hes calling elijah one man ran filled a sponge with wine vinegar put it on a stick and offered it to jesus to drink now leave him alone lets see if elijah comes to take him down he said with a loud cry jesus breathed his last the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom and when the centurion who stood there in front of jesus heard his cry and saw how he died he said surely this man was the son of god some women were watching from a distance among them were mary magdalene mary the mother of james the younger and of joses and salome in galilee these women had followed him and cared for his needs many other women who had come up with him to jerusalem were also there it was preparation day that is the day before the sabbath so as evening approached joseph of arimathea a prominent member of the council who was himself waiting for the kingdom of god went boldly to pilate and asked for jesus body pilate was surprised to hear that he was already dead summoning the centurion he asked him if jesus had already died when he learned from the centurion that it was so he gave the body to joseph so joseph bought some linen cloth took down the body wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of rock then he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb mary magdalene and mary the mother of joses saw where he was laid when the sabbath was over mary magdalene mary the mother of james and salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint jesus body very early on the first day of the week just after sunrise they were on their way to the tomb and they asked each other who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb but when they looked up they saw that the stone which was very large had been rolled away as they entered the tomb they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side and they were alarmed dont be alarmed he said you are looking for jesus the nazarene who was crucified he has risen he is not here see the place where they laid him but go tell his disciples and peter he is going ahead of you into galilee there you will see him just as he told you trembling and bewildered the women went out and fled from the tomb they said nothing to anyone because they were afraid when jesus rose early on the first day of the week he appeared first to mary magdalene out of whom he had driven seven demons she went and told those who had been with him and who were mourning and weeping when they heard that jesus was alive and that she had seen him they did not believe it afterward jesus appeared in a different form to two of them while they were walking in the country these returned and reported it to the rest but they did not believe them either later jesus appeared to the eleven as they were eating he rebuked them for their lack of faith and their stubborn refusal to believe those who had seen him after he had risen he said to them go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation whoever believes and is baptized will be saved but whoever does not believe will be condemned and these signs will accompany those who believe in my name they will drive out demons they will speak in new tongues they will pick up snakes with their hands and when they drink deadly poison it will not hurt them at all they will place their hands on sick people and they will get well after the lord jesus had spoken to them he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of god then the disciples went out and preached everywhere and the lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it  many have undertaken to draw up an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us just as they were handed down to us by those who from the first were eyewitnesses and servants of the word therefore since i myself have carefully investigated everything from the beginning it seemed good also to me to write an orderly account for you most excellent theophilus so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught in the time of herod king of judea there was a priest named zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of abijah his wife elizabeth was also a descendant of aaron both of them were upright in the sight of god observing all the lords commandments and regulations blamelessly but they had no children because elizabeth was barren and they were both well along in years once when zechariahs division was on duty and he was serving as priest before god he was chosen by lot according to the custom of the priesthood to go into the temple of the lord and burn incense and when the time for the burning of incense came all the assembled worshipers were praying outside then an angel of the lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense when zechariah saw him he was startled and was gripped with fear but the angel said to him do not be afraid zechariah your prayer has been heard your wife elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to give him the name john he will be a joy and delight to you and many will rejoice because of his birth for he will be great in the sight of the lord he is never to take wine or other fermented drink and he will be filled with the holy spirit even from birth many of the people of israel will he bring back to the lord their god and he will go on before the lord in the spirit and power of elijah to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous to make ready a people prepared for the lord zechariah asked the angel how can i be sure of this i am an old man and my wife is well along in years the angel answered i am gabriel i stand in the presence of god and i have been sent to speak to you and to tell you this good news and now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens because you did not believe my words which will come true at their proper time meanwhile the people were waiting for zechariah and wondering why he stayed so long in the temple when he came out he could not speak to them they realized he had seen a vision in the temple for he kept making signs to them but remained unable to speak when his time of service was completed he returned home after this his wife elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in seclusion the lord has done this for me she said in these days he has shown his favor and taken away my disgrace among the people in the sixth month god sent the angel gabriel to nazareth a town in galilee to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named joseph a descendant of david the virgins name was mary the angel went to her and said greetings you who are highly favored the lord is with you mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be but the angel said to her do not be afraid mary you have found favor with god you will be with child and give birth to a son and you are to give him the name jesus he will be great and will be called the son of the most high the lord god will give him the throne of his father david and he will reign over the house of jacob forever his kingdom will never end how will this be mary asked the angel since i am a virgin the angel answered the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you so the holy one to be born will be called the son of god even elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age and she who was said to be barren is in her sixth month for nothing is impossible with god i am the lords servant mary answered may it be to me as you have said then the angel left her at that time mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of judea where she entered zechariahs home and greeted elizabeth when elizabeth heard marys greeting the baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit in a loud voice she exclaimed blessed are you among women and blessed is the child you will bear but why am i so favored that the mother of my lord should come to me as soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy blessed is she who has believed that what the lord has said to her will be accomplished and mary said my soul glorifies the lord and my spirit rejoices in god my savior for he has been mindful of the humble state of his servant from now on all generations will call me blessed for the mighty one has done great things for me holy is his name his mercy extends to those who fear him from generation to generation he has performed mighty deeds with his arm he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts he has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble he has filled the hungry with good things but has sent the rich away empty he has helped his servant israel remembering to be merciful to abraham and his descendants forever even as he said to our fathers mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then returned home when it was time for elizabeth to have her baby she gave birth to a son her neighbors and relatives heard that the lord had shown her great mercy and they shared her joy on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child and they were going to name him after his father zechariah but his mother spoke up and said no he is to be called john they said to her there is no one among your relatives who has that name then they made signs to his father to find out what he would like to name the child he asked for a writing tablet and to everyones astonishment he wrote his name is john immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue was loosed and he began to speak praising god the neighbors were all filled with awe and throughout the hill country of judea people were talking about all these things everyone who heard this wondered about it asking what then is this child going to be for the lords hand was with him his father zechariah was filled with the holy spirit and prophesied praise be to the lord the god of israel because he has come and has redeemed his people he has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david as he said through his holy prophets of long ago salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us to show mercy to our fathers and to remember his holy covenant the oath he swore to our father abraham to rescue us from the hand of our enemies and to enable us to serve him without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all our days and you my child will be called a prophet of the most high for you will go on before the lord to prepare the way for him to give his people the knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins because of the tender mercy of our god by which the rising sun will come to us from heaven to shine on those living in darkness and in the shadow of death to guide our feet into the path of peace and the child grew and became strong in spirit and he lived in the desert until he appeared publicly to israel in those days caesar augustus issued a decree that a census should be taken of the entire roman world this was the first census that took place while quirinius was governor of syria and everyone went to his own town to register so joseph also went up from the town of nazareth in galilee to judea to bethlehem the town of david because he belonged to the house and line of david he went there to register with mary who was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child while they were there the time came for the baby to be born and she gave birth to her firstborn a son she wrapped him in cloths and placed him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn and there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks at night an angel of the lord appeared to them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were terrified but the angel said to them do not be afraid i bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people today in the town of david a savior has been born to you he is christ the lord this will be a sign to you you will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger suddenly a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel praising god and saying glory to god in the highest and on earth peace to men on whom his favor rests when the angels had left them and gone into heaven the shepherds said to one another lets go to bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the lord has told us about so they hurried off and found mary and joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger when they had seen him they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them but mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart the shepherds returned glorifying and praising god for all the things they had heard and seen which were just as they had been told on the eighth day when it was time to circumcise him he was named jesus the name the angel had given him before he had been conceived when the time of their purification according to the law of moses had been completed joseph and mary took him to jerusalem to present him to the lord as it is written in the law of the lord every firstborn male is to be consecrated to the lord  and to offer a sacrifice in keeping with what is said in the law of the lord a pair of doves or two young pigeons now there was a man in jerusalem called simeon who was righteous and devout he was waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy spirit was upon him it had been revealed to him by the holy spirit that he would not die before he had seen the lords christ moved by the spirit he went into the temple courts when the parents brought in the child jesus to do for him what the custom of the law required simeon took him in his arms and praised god saying sovereign lord as you have promised you now dismiss your servant in peace for my eyes have seen your salvation which you have prepared in the sight of all people a light for revelation to the gentiles and for glory to your people israel the childs father and mother marveled at what was said about him then simeon blessed them and said to mary his mother this child is destined to cause the falling and rising of many in israel and to be a sign that will be spoken against so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed and a sword will pierce your own soul too there was also a prophetess anna the daughter of phanuel of the tribe of asher she was very old she had lived with her husband seven years after her marriage and then was a widow until she was eighty four she never left the temple but worshiped night and day fasting and praying coming up to them at that very moment she gave thanks to god and spoke about the child to all who were looking forward to the redemption of jerusalem when joseph and mary had done everything required by the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own town of nazareth and the child grew and became strong he was filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him every year his parents went to jerusalem for the feast of the passover when he was twelve years old they went up to the feast according to the custom after the feast was over while his parents were returning home the boy jesus stayed behind in jerusalem but they were unaware of it thinking he was in their company they traveled on for a day then they began looking for him among their relatives and friends when they did not find him they went back to jerusalem to look for him after three days they found him in the temple courts sitting among the teachers listening to them and asking them questions everyone who heard him was amazed at his understanding and his answers when his parents saw him they were astonished his mother said to him son why have you treated us like this your father and i have been anxiously searching for you why were you searching for me he asked didnt you know i had to be in my fathers house but they did not understand what he was saying to them then he went down to nazareth with them and was obedient to them but his mother treasured all these things in her heart and jesus grew in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and men in the fifteenth year of the reign of tiberius caesar when pontius pilate was governor of judea herod tetrarch of galilee his brother philip tetrarch of iturea and traconitis and lysanias tetrarch of abilene during the high priesthood of annas and caiaphas the word of god came to john son of zechariah in the desert he went into all the country around the jordan preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins as is written in the book of the words of isaiah the prophet a voice of one calling in the desert prepare the way for the lord make straight paths for him every valley shall be filled in every mountain and hill made low the crooked roads shall become straight the rough ways smooth and all mankind will see gods salvation john said to the crowds coming out to be baptized by him you brood of vipers who warned you to flee from the coming wrath produce fruit in keeping with repentance and do not begin to say to yourselves we have abraham as our father for i tell you that out of these stones god can raise up children for abraham the ax is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire what should we do then the crowd asked john answered the man with two tunics should share with him who has none and the one who has food should do the same tax collectors also came to be baptized teacher they asked what should we do dont collect any more than you are required to he told them then some soldiers asked him and what should we do he replied dont extort money and dont accuse people falsely be content with your pay the people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if john might possibly be the christ john answered them all i baptize you with water but one more powerful than i will come the thongs of whose sandals i am not worthy to untie he will baptize you with the holy spirit and with fire his winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire and with many other words john exhorted the people and preached the good news to them but when john rebuked herod the tetrarch because of herodias his brothers wife and all the other evil things he had done herod added this to them all he locked john up in prison when all the people were being baptized jesus was baptized too and as he was praying heaven was opened and the holy spirit descended on him in bodily form like a dove and a voice came from heaven you are my son whom i love with you i am well pleased now jesus himself was about thirty years old when he began his ministry he was the son so it was thought of joseph the son of heli the son of matthat the son of levi the son of melki the son of jannai the son of joseph the son of mattathias the son of amos the son of nahum the son of esli the son of naggai the son of maath the son of mattathias the son of semein the son of josech the son of joda the son of joanan the son of rhesa the son of zerubbabel the son of shealtiel the son of neri the son of melki the son of addi the son of cosam the son of elmadam the son of er the son of joshua the son of eliezer the son of jorim the son of matthat the son of levi the son of simeon the son of judah the son of joseph the son of jonam the son of eliakim the son of melea the son of menna the son of mattatha the son of nathan the son of david the son of jesse the son of obed the son of boaz the son of salmon the son of nahshon the son of amminadab the son of ram the son of hezron the son of perez the son of judah the son of jacob the son of isaac the son of abraham the son of terah the son of nahor the son of serug the son of reu the son of peleg the son of eber the son of shelah the son of cainan the son of arphaxad the son of shem the son of noah the son of lamech the son of methuselah the son of enoch the son of jared the son of mahalalel the son of kenan the son of enosh the son of seth the son of adam the son of god jesus full of the holy spirit returned from the jordan and was led by the spirit in the desert where for forty days he was tempted by the devil he ate nothing during those days and at the end of them he was hungry the devil said to him if you are the son of god tell this stone to become bread jesus answered it is written man does not live on bread alone the devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world and he said to him i will give you all their authority and splendor for it has been given to me and i can give it to anyone i want to so if you worship me it will all be yours jesus answered it is written worship the lord your god and serve him only the devil led him to jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple if you are the son of god he said throw yourself down from here for it is written he will command his angels concerning you to guard you carefully they will lift you up in their hands so that you will not strike your foot against a stone jesus answered it says do not put the lord your god to the test when the devil had finished all this tempting he left him until an opportune time jesus returned to galilee in the power of the spirit and news about him spread through the whole countryside he taught in their synagogues and everyone praised him he went to nazareth where he had been brought up and on the sabbath day he went into the synagogue as was his custom and he stood up to read the scroll of the prophet isaiah was handed to him unrolling it he found the place where it is written the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor then he rolled up the scroll gave it back to the attendant and sat down the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began by saying to them today this scripture is fulfilled in your hearing all spoke well of him and were amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips isnt this josephs son they asked jesus said to them surely you will quote this proverb to me physician heal yourself do here in your hometown what we have heard that you did in capernaum i tell you the truth he continued no prophet is accepted in his hometown i assure you that there were many widows in israel in elijahs time when the sky was shut for three and a half years and there was a severe famine throughout the land yet elijah was not sent to any of them but to a widow in zarephath in the region of sidon and there were many in israel with leprosy in the time of elisha the prophet yet not one of them was cleansed only naaman the syrian all the people in the synagogue were furious when they heard this they got up drove him out of the town and took him to the brow of the hill on which the town was built in order to throw him down the cliff but he walked right through the crowd and went on his way then he went down to capernaum a town in galilee and on the sabbath began to teach the people they were amazed at his teaching because his message had authority in the synagogue there was a man possessed by a demon an evil spirit he cried out at the top of his voice ha what do you want with us jesus of nazareth have you come to destroy us i know who you are the holy one of god be quiet jesus said sternly come out of him then the demon threw the man down before them all and came out without injuring him all the people were amazed and said to each other what is this teaching with authority and power he gives orders to evil spirits and they come out and the news about him spread throughout the surrounding area jesus left the synagogue and went to the home of simon now simons mother in law was suffering from a high fever and they asked jesus to help her so he bent over her and rebuked the fever and it left her she got up at once and began to wait on them when the sun was setting the people brought to jesus all who had various kinds of sickness and laying his hands on each one he healed them moreover demons came out of many people shouting you are the son of god but he rebuked them and would not allow them to speak because they knew he was the christ at daybreak jesus went out to a solitary place the people were looking for him and when they came to where he was they tried to keep him from leaving them but he said i must preach the good news of the kingdom of god to the other towns also because that is why i was sent and he kept on preaching in the synagogues of judea one day as jesus was standing by the lake of gennesaret with the people crowding around him and listening to the word of god he saw at the waters edge two boats left there by the fishermen who were washing their nets he got into one of the boats the one belonging to simon and asked him to put out a little from shore then he sat down and taught the people from the boat when he had finished speaking he said to simon put out into deep water and let down the nets for a catch simon answered master weve worked hard all night and havent caught anything but because you say so i will let down the nets when they had done so they caught such a large number of fish that their nets began to break so they signaled their partners in the other boat to come and help them and they came and filled both boats so full that they began to sink when simon peter saw this he fell at jesus knees and said go away from me lord i am a sinful man for he and all his companions were astonished at the catch of fish they had taken and so were james and john the sons of zebedee simons partners then jesus said to simon dont be afraid from now on you will catch men so they pulled their boats up on shore left everything and followed him while jesus was in one of the towns a man came along who was covered with leprosy when he saw jesus he fell with his face to the ground and begged him lord if you are willing you can make me clean jesus reached out his hand and touched the man i am willing he said be clean and immediately the leprosy left him then jesus ordered him dont tell anyone but go show yourself to the priest and offer the sacrifices that moses commanded for your cleansing as a testimony to them yet the news about him spread all the more so that crowds of people came to hear him and to be healed of their sicknesses but jesus often withdrew to lonely places and prayed one day as he was teaching pharisees and teachers of the law who had come from every village of galilee and from judea and jerusalem were sitting there and the power of the lord was present for him to heal the sick some men came carrying a paralytic on a mat and tried to take him into the house to lay him before jesus when they could not find a way to do this because of the crowd they went up on the roof and lowered him on his mat through the tiles into the middle of the crowd right in front of jesus when jesus saw their faith he said friend your sins are forgiven the pharisees and the teachers of the law began thinking to themselves who is this fellow who speaks blasphemy who can forgive sins but god alone jesus knew what they were thinking and asked why are you thinking these things in your hearts which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or to say get up and walk but that you may know that the son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins he said to the paralyzed man i tell you get up take your mat and go home immediately he stood up in front of them took what he had been lying on and went home praising god everyone was amazed and gave praise to god they were filled with awe and said we have seen remarkable things today after this jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of levi sitting at his tax booth follow me jesus said to him and levi got up left everything and followed him then levi held a great banquet for jesus at his house and a large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them but the pharisees and the teachers of the law who belonged to their sect complained to his disciples why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners jesus answered them it is not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick i have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance they said to him johns disciples often fast and pray and so do the disciples of the pharisees but yours go on eating and drinking jesus answered can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them in those days they will fast he told them this parable no one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old one if he does he will have torn the new garment and the patch from the new will not match the old and no one pours new wine into old wineskins if he does the new wine will burst the skins the wine will run out and the wineskins will be ruined no new wine must be poured into new wineskins and no one after drinking old wine wants the new for he says the old is better one sabbath jesus was going through the grainfields and his disciples began to pick some heads of grain rub them in their hands and eat the kernels some of the pharisees asked why are you doing what is unlawful on the sabbath jesus answered them have you never read what david did when he and his companions were hungry he entered the house of god and taking the consecrated bread he ate what is lawful only for priests to eat and he also gave some to his companions then jesus said to them the son of man is lord of the sabbath on another sabbath he went into the synagogue and was teaching and a man was there whose right hand was shriveled the pharisees and the teachers of the law were looking for a reason to accuse jesus so they watched him closely to see if he would heal on the sabbath but jesus knew what they were thinking and said to the man with the shriveled hand get up and stand in front of everyone so he got up and stood there then jesus said to them i ask you which is lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do evil to save life or to destroy it he looked around at them all and then said to the man stretch out your hand he did so and his hand was completely restored but they were furious and began to discuss with one another what they might do to jesus one of those days jesus went out to a mountainside to pray and spent the night praying to god when morning came he called his disciples to him and chose twelve of them whom he also designated apostles simon whom he named peter his brother andrew james john philip bartholomew matthew thomas james son of alphaeus simon who was called the zealot judas son of james and judas iscariot who became a traitor he went down with them and stood on a level place a large crowd of his disciples was there and a great number of people from all over judea from jerusalem and from the coast of tyre and sidon who had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases those troubled by evil spirits were cured and the people all tried to touch him because power was coming from him and healing them all looking at his disciples he said blessed are you who are poor for yours is the kingdom of god blessed are you who hunger now for you will be satisfied blessed are you who weep now for you will laugh blessed are you when men hate you when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil because of the son of man rejoice in that day and leap for joy because great is your reward in heaven for that is how their fathers treated the prophets but woe to you who are rich for you have already received your comfort woe to you who are well fed now for you will go hungry woe to you who laugh now for you will mourn and weep woe to you when all men speak well of you for that is how their fathers treated the false prophets but i tell you who hear me love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you pray for those who mistreat you if someone strikes you on one cheek turn to him the other also if someone takes your cloak do not stop him from taking your tunic give to everyone who asks you and if anyone takes what belongs to you do not demand it back do to others as you would have them do to you if you love those who love you what credit is that to you even sinners love those who love them and if you do good to those who are good to you what credit is that to you even sinners do that and if you lend to those from whom you expect repayment what credit is that to you even sinners lend to sinners expecting to be repaid in full but love your enemies do good to them and lend to them without expecting to get anything back then your reward will be great and you will be sons of the most high because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked be merciful just as your father is merciful do not judge and you will not be judged do not condemn and you will not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven give and it will be given to you a good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap for with the measure you use it will be measured to you he also told them this parable can a blind man lead a blind man will they not both fall into a pit a student is not above his teacher but everyone who is fully trained will be like his teacher why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye how can you say to your brother brother let me take the speck out of your eye when you yourself fail to see the plank in your own eye you hypocrite first take the plank out of your eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye no good tree bears bad fruit nor does a bad tree bear good fruit each tree is recognized by its own fruit people do not pick figs from thornbushes or grapes from briers the good man brings good things out of the good stored up in his heart and the evil man brings evil things out of the evil stored up in his heart for out of the overflow of his heart his mouth speaks why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i say i will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice he is like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock when a flood came the torrent struck that house but could not shake it because it was well built but the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation the moment the torrent struck that house it collapsed and its destruction was complete when jesus had finished saying all this in the hearing of the people he entered capernaum there a centurions servant whom his master valued highly was sick and about to die the centurion heard of jesus and sent some elders of the jews to him asking him to come and heal his servant when they came to jesus they pleaded earnestly with him this man deserves to have you do this because he loves our nation and has built our synagogue so jesus went with them he was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to say to him lord dont trouble yourself for i do not deserve to have you come under my roof that is why i did not even consider myself worthy to come to you but say the word and my servant will be healed for i myself am a man under authority with soldiers under me i tell this one go and he goes and that one come and he comes i say to my servant do this and he does it when jesus heard this he was amazed at him and turning to the crowd following him he said i tell you i have not found such great faith even in israel then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant well soon afterward jesus went to a town called nain and his disciples and a large crowd went along with him as he approached the town gate a dead person was being carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and a large crowd from the town was with her when the lord saw her his heart went out to her and he said dont cry then he went up and touched the coffin and those carrying it stood still he said young man i say to you get up the dead man sat up and began to talk and jesus gave him back to his mother they were all filled with awe and praised god a great prophet has appeared among us they said god has come to help his people this news about jesus spread throughout judea and the surrounding country johns disciples told him about all these things calling two of them he sent them to the lord to ask are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else when the men came to jesus they said john the baptist sent us to you to ask are you the one who was to come or should we expect someone else at that very time jesus cured many who had diseases sicknesses and evil spirits and gave sight to many who were blind so he replied to the messengers go back and report to john what you have seen and heard the blind receive sight the lame walk those who have leprosy are cured the deaf hear the dead are raised and the good news is preached to the poor blessed is the man who does not fall away on account of me after johns messengers left jesus began to speak to the crowd about john what did you go out into the desert to see a reed swayed by the wind if not what did you go out to see a man dressed in fine clothes no those who wear expensive clothes and indulge in luxury are in palaces but what did you go out to see a prophet yes i tell you and more than a prophet this is the one about whom it is written i will send my messenger ahead of you who will prepare your way before you i tell you among those born of women there is no one greater than john yet the one who is least in the kingdom of god is greater than he all the people even the tax collectors when they heard jesus words acknowledged that gods way was right because they had been baptized by john but the pharisees and experts in the law rejected gods purpose for themselves because they had not been baptized by john to what then can i compare the people of this generation what are they like they are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other we played the flute for you and you did not dance we sang a dirge and you did not cry for john the baptist came neither eating bread nor drinking wine and you say he has a demon the son of man came eating and drinking and you say here is a glutton and a drunkard a friend of tax collectors and sinners but wisdom is proved right by all her children now one of the pharisees invited jesus to have dinner with him so he went to the pharisees house and reclined at the table when a woman who had lived a sinful life in that town learned that jesus was eating at the pharisees house she brought an alabaster jar of perfume and as she stood behind him at his feet weeping she began to wet his feet with her tears then she wiped them with her hair kissed them and poured perfume on them when the pharisee who had invited him saw this he said to himself if this man were a prophet he would know who is touching him and what kind of woman she is that she is a sinner jesus answered him simon i have something to tell youtell me teacher he said two men owed money to a certain moneylender one owed him five hundred denarii and the other fifty neither of them had the money to pay him back so he canceled the debts of both now which of them will love him more simon replied i suppose the one who had the bigger debt canceledyou have judged correctly jesus said then he turned toward the woman and said to simon do you see this woman i came into your house you did not give me any water for my feet but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair you did not give me a kiss but this woman from the time i entered has not stopped kissing my feet you did not put oil on my head but she has poured perfume on my feet therefore i tell you her many sins have been forgiven for she loved much but he who has been forgiven little loves little then jesus said to her your sins are forgiven the other guests began to say among themselves who is this who even forgives sins jesus said to the woman your faith has saved you go in peace after this jesus traveled about from one town and village to another proclaiming the good news of the kingdom of god the twelve were with him and also some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases mary called magdalene from whom seven demons had come out joanna the wife of cuza the manager of herods household susanna and many others these women were helping to support them out of their own means while a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to jesus from town after town he told this parable a farmer went out to sow his seed as he was scattering the seed some fell along the path it was trampled on and the birds of the air ate it up some fell on rock and when it came up the plants withered because they had no moisture other seed fell among thorns which grew up with it and choked the plants still other seed fell on good soil it came up and yielded a crop a hundred times more than was sown when he said this he called out he who has ears to hear let him hear his disciples asked him what this parable meant he said the knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of god has been given to you but to others i speak in parables so that though seeing they may not see though hearing they may not understand this is the meaning of the parable the seed is the word of god those along the path are the ones who hear and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts so that they may not believe and be saved those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it but they have no root they believe for a while but in the time of testing they fall away the seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear but as they go on their way they are choked by lifes worries riches and pleasures and they do not mature but the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart who hear the word retain it and by persevering produce a crop no one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed instead he puts it on a stand so that those who come in can see the light for there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed and nothing concealed that will not be known or brought out into the open therefore consider carefully how you listen whoever has will be given more whoever does not have even what he thinks he has will be taken from him now jesus mother and brothers came to see him but they were not able to get near him because of the crowd someone told him your mother and brothers are standing outside wanting to see you he replied my mother and brothers are those who hear gods word and put it into practice one day jesus said to his disciples lets go over to the other side of the lake so they got into a boat and set out as they sailed he fell asleep a squall came down on the lake so that the boat was being swamped and they were in great danger the disciples went and woke him saying master master were going to drown he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waters the storm subsided and all was calm where is your faith he asked his disciples in fear and amazement they asked one another who is this he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him they sailed to the region of the gerasenes which is across the lake from galilee when jesus stepped ashore he was met by a demon possessed man from the town for a long time this man had not worn clothes or lived in a house but had lived in the tombs when he saw jesus he cried out and fell at his feet shouting at the top of his voice what do you want with me jesus son of the most high god i beg you dont torture me for jesus had commanded the evil spirit to come out of the man many times it had seized him and though he was chained hand and foot and kept under guard he had broken his chains and had been driven by the demon into solitary places jesus asked him what is your name legion he replied because many demons had gone into him and they begged him repeatedly not to order them to go into the abyss a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside the demons begged jesus to let them go into them and he gave them permission when the demons came out of the man they went into the pigs and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the lake and was drowned when those tending the pigs saw what had happened they ran off and reported this in the town and countryside and the people went out to see what had happened when they came to jesus they found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at jesus feet dressed and in his right mind and they were afraid those who had seen it told the people how the demon possessed man had been cured then all the people of the region of the gerasenes asked jesus to leave them because they were overcome with fear so he got into the boat and left the man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him but jesus sent him away saying return home and tell how much god has done for you so the man went away and told all over town how much jesus had done for him now when jesus returned a crowd welcomed him for they were all expecting him then a man named jairus a ruler of the synagogue came and fell at jesus feet pleading with him to come to his house because his only daughter a girl of about twelve was dying as jesus was on his way the crowds almost crushed him and a woman was there who had been subject to bleeding for twelve years but no one could heal her she came up behind him and touched the edge of his cloak and immediately her bleeding stopped who touched me jesus asked when they all denied it peter said master the people are crowding and pressing against you but jesus said someone touched me i know that power has gone out from me then the woman seeing that she could not go unnoticed came trembling and fell at his feet in the presence of all the people she told why she had touched him and how she had been instantly healed then he said to her daughter your faith has healed you go in peace while jesus was still speaking someone came from the house of jairus the synagogue ruler your daughter is dead he said dont bother the teacher any more hearing this jesus said to jairus dont be afraid just believe and she will be healed when he arrived at the house of jairus he did not let anyone go in with him except peter john and james and the childs father and mother meanwhile all the people were wailing and mourning for her stop wailing jesus said she is not dead but asleep they laughed at him knowing that she was dead but he took her by the hand and said my child get up her spirit returned and at once she stood up then jesus told them to give her something to eat her parents were astonished but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened when jesus had called the twelve together he gave them power and authority to drive out all demons and to cure diseases and he sent them out to preach the kingdom of god and to heal the sick he told them take nothing for the journey no staff no bag no bread no money no extra tunic whatever house you enter stay there until you leave that town if people do not welcome you shake the dust off your feet when you leave their town as a testimony against them so they set out and went from village to village preaching the gospel and healing people everywhere now herod the tetrarch heard about all that was going on and he was perplexed because some were saying that john had been raised from the dead others that elijah had appeared and still others that one of the prophets of long ago had come back to life but herod said i beheaded john who then is this i hear such things about and he tried to see him when the apostles returned they reported to jesus what they had done then he took them with him and they withdrew by themselves to a town called bethsaida but the crowds learned about it and followed him he welcomed them and spoke to them about the kingdom of god and healed those who needed healing late in the afternoon the twelve came to him and said send the crowd away so they can go to the surrounding villages and countryside and find food and lodging because we are in a remote place here he replied you give them something to eat they answered we have only five loaves of bread and two fish unless we go and buy food for all this crowd about five thousand men were there but he said to his disciples have them sit down in groups of about fifty each the disciples did so and everybody sat down taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke them then he gave them to the disciples to set before the people they all ate and were satisfied and the disciples picked up twelve basketfuls of broken pieces that were left over once when jesus was praying in private and his disciples were with him he asked them who do the crowds say i am they replied some say john the baptist others say elijah and still others that one of the prophets of long ago has come back to life but what about you he asked who do you say i am peter answered the christ of god jesus strictly warned them not to tell this to anyone and he said the son of man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders chief priests and teachers of the law and he must be killed and on the third day be raised to life then he said to them all if anyone would come after me he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me for whoever wants to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for me will save it what good is it for a man to gain the whole world and yet lose or forfeit his very self if anyone is ashamed of me and my words the son of man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the father and of the holy angels i tell you the truth some who are standing here will not taste death before they see the kingdom of god about eight days after jesus said this he took peter john and james with him and went up onto a mountain to pray as he was praying the appearance of his face changed and his clothes became as bright as a flash of lightning two men moses and elijah appeared in glorious splendor talking with jesus they spoke about his departure which he was about to bring to fulfillment at jerusalem peter and his companions were very sleepy but when they became fully awake they saw his glory and the two men standing with him as the men were leaving jesus peter said to him master it is good for us to be here let us put up three shelters one for you one for moses and one for elijah he did not know what he was saying while he was speaking a cloud appeared and enveloped them and they were afraid as they entered the cloud a voice came from the cloud saying this is my son whom i have chosen listen to him when the voice had spoken they found that jesus was alone the disciples kept this to themselves and told no one at that time what they had seen the next day when they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him a man in the crowd called out teacher i beg you to look at my son for he is my only child a spirit seizes him and he suddenly screams it throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth it scarcely ever leaves him and is destroying him i begged your disciples to drive it out but they could not o unbelieving and perverse generation jesus replied how long shall i stay with you and put up with you bring your son here even while the boy was coming the demon threw him to the ground in a convulsion but jesus rebuked the evil spirit healed the boy and gave him back to his father and they were all amazed at the greatness of god while everyone was marveling at all that jesus did he said to his disciples listen carefully to what i am about to tell you the son of man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men but they did not understand what this meant it was hidden from them so that they did not grasp it and they were afraid to ask him about it an argument started among the disciples as to which of them would be the greatest jesus knowing their thoughts took a little child and had him stand beside him then he said to them whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me for he who is least among you all he is the greatest master said john we saw a man driving out demons in your name and we tried to stop him because he is not one of us do not stop him jesus said for whoever is not against you is for you as the time approached for him to be taken up to heaven jesus resolutely set out for jerusalem and he sent messengers on ahead who went into a samaritan village to get things ready for him but the people there did not welcome him because he was heading for jerusalem when the disciples james and john saw this they asked lord do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them but jesus turned and rebuked them and they went to another village as they were walking along the road a man said to him i will follow you wherever you go jesus replied foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests but the son of man has no place to lay his head he said to another man follow me but the man replied lord first let me go and bury my father jesus said to him let the dead bury their own dead but you go and proclaim the kingdom of god still another said i will follow you lord but first let me go back and say good bye to my family jesus replied no one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of god after this the lord appointed seventy two others and sent them two by two ahead of him to every town and place where he was about to go he told them the harvest is plentiful but the workers are few ask the lord of the harvest therefore to send out workers into his harvest field go i am sending you out like lambs among wolves do not take a purse or bag or sandals and do not greet anyone on the road when you enter a house first say peace to this house if a man of peace is there your peace will rest on him if not it will return to you stay in that house eating and drinking whatever they give you for the worker deserves his wages do not move around from house to house when you enter a town and are welcomed eat what is set before you heal the sick who are there and tell them the kingdom of god is near you but when you enter a town and are not welcomed go into its streets and say even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you yet be sure of this the kingdom of god is near i tell you it will be more bearable on that day for sodom than for that town woe to you korazin woe to you bethsaida for if the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in tyre and sidon they would have repented long ago sitting in sackcloth and ashes but it will be more bearable for tyre and sidon at the judgment than for you and you capernaum will you be lifted up to the skies no you will go down to the depths he who listens to you listens to me he who rejects you rejects me but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me the seventy two returned with joy and said lord even the demons submit to us in your name he replied i saw satan fall like lightning from heaven i have given you authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to overcome all the power of the enemy nothing will harm you however do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you but rejoice that your names are written in heaven at that time jesus full of joy through the holy spirit said i praise you father lord of heaven and earth because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned and revealed them to little children yes father for this was your good pleasure all things have been committed to me by my father no one knows who the son is except the father and no one knows who the father is except the son and those to whom the son chooses to reveal him then he turned to his disciples and said privately blessed are the eyes that see what you see for i tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it and to hear what you hear but did not hear it on one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test jesus teacher he asked what must i do to inherit eternal life what is written in the law he replied how do you read it he answered love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind and love your neighbor as yourself you have answered correctly jesus replied do this and you will live but he wanted to justify himself so he asked jesus and who is my neighbor in reply jesus said a man was going down from jerusalem to jericho when he fell into the hands of robbers they stripped him of his clothes beat him and went away leaving him half dead a priest happened to be going down the same road and when he saw the man he passed by on the other side so too a levite when he came to the place and saw him passed by on the other side but a samaritan as he traveled came where the man was and when he saw him he took pity on him he went to him and bandaged his wounds pouring on oil and wine then he put the man on his own donkey took him to an inn and took care of him the next day he took out two silver coins and gave them to the innkeeper look after him he said and when i return i will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers the expert in the law replied the one who had mercy on him jesus told him go and do likewise as jesus and his disciples were on their way he came to a village where a woman named martha opened her home to him she had a sister called mary who sat at the lords feet listening to what he said but martha was distracted by all the preparations that had to be made she came to him and asked lord dont you care that my sister has left me to do the work by myself tell her to help me martha martha the lord answered you are worried and upset about many things but only one thing is needed mary has chosen what is better and it will not be taken away from her one day jesus was praying in a certain place when he finished one of his disciples said to him lord teach us to pray just as john taught his disciples he said to them when you pray say father hallowed be your name your kingdom come give us each day our daily bread forgive us our sins for we also forgive everyone who sins against us and lead us not into temptation then he said to them suppose one of you has a friend and he goes to him at midnight and says friend lend me three loaves of bread because a friend of mine on a journey has come to me and i have nothing to set before him then the one inside answers dont bother me the door is already locked and my children are with me in bed i cant get up and give you anything i tell you though he will not get up and give him the bread because he is his friend yet because of the mans boldness he will get up and give him as much as he needs so i say to you ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened which of you fathers if your son asks for a fish will give him a snake instead or if he asks for an egg will give him a scorpion if you then though you are evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father in heaven give the holy spirit to those who ask him jesus was driving out a demon that was mute when the demon left the man who had been mute spoke and the crowd was amazed but some of them said by beelzebub the prince of demons he is driving out demons others tested him by asking for a sign from heaven jesus knew their thoughts and said to them any kingdom divided against itself will be ruined and a house divided against itself will fall if satan is divided against himself how can his kingdom stand i say this because you claim that i drive out demons by beelzebub now if i drive out demons by beelzebub by whom do your followers drive them out so then they will be your judges but if i drive out demons by the finger of god then the kingdom of god has come to you when a strong man fully armed guards his own house his possessions are safe but when someone stronger attacks and overpowers him he takes away the armor in which the man trusted and divides up the spoils he who is not with me is against me and he who does not gather with me scatters when an evil spirit comes out of a man it goes through arid places seeking rest and does not find it then it says i will return to the house i left when it arrives it finds the house swept clean and put in order then it goes and takes seven other spirits more wicked than itself and they go in and live there and the final condition of that man is worse than the first as jesus was saying these things a woman in the crowd called out blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you he replied blessed rather are those who hear the word of god and obey it as the crowds increased jesus said this is a wicked generation it asks for a miraculous sign but none will be given it except the sign of jonah for as jonah was a sign to the ninevites so also will the son of man be to this generation the queen of the south will rise at the judgment with the men of this generation and condemn them for she came from the ends of the earth to listen to solomons wisdom and now one greater than solomon is here the men of nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it for they repented at the preaching of jonah and now one greater than jonah is here no one lights a lamp and puts it in a place where it will be hidden or under a bowl instead he puts it on its stand so that those who come in may see the light your eye is the lamp of your body when your eyes are good your whole body also is full of light but when they are bad your body also is full of darkness see to it then that the light within you is not darkness therefore if your whole body is full of light and no part of it dark it will be completely lighted as when the light of a lamp shines on you when jesus had finished speaking a pharisee invited him to eat with him so he went in and reclined at the table but the pharisee noticing that jesus did not first wash before the meal was surprised then the lord said to him now then you pharisees clean the outside of the cup and dish but inside you are full of greed and wickedness you foolish people did not the one who made the outside make the inside also but give what is inside the dish to the poor and everything will be clean for you woe to you pharisees because you give god a tenth of your mint rue and all other kinds of garden herbs but you neglect justice and the love of god you should have practiced the latter without leaving the former undone woe to you pharisees because you love the most important seats in the synagogues and greetings in the marketplaces woe to you because you are like unmarked graves which men walk over without knowing it one of the experts in the law answered him teacher when you say these things you insult us also jesus replied and you experts in the law woe to you because you load people down with burdens they can hardly carry and you yourselves will not lift one finger to help them woe to you because you build tombs for the prophets and it was your forefathers who killed them so you testify that you approve of what your forefathers did they killed the prophets and you build their tombs because of this god in his wisdom said i will send them prophets and apostles some of whom they will kill and others they will persecute therefore this generation will be held responsible for the blood of all the prophets that has been shed since the beginning of the world from the blood of abel to the blood of zechariah who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary yes i tell you this generation will be held responsible for it all woe to you experts in the law because you have taken away the key to knowledge you yourselves have not entered and you have hindered those who were entering when jesus left there the pharisees and the teachers of the law began to oppose him fiercely and to besiege him with questions waiting to catch him in something he might say meanwhile when a crowd of many thousands had gathered so that they were trampling on one another jesus began to speak first to his disciples saying be on your guard against the yeast of the pharisees which is hypocrisy there is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed or hidden that will not be made known what you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs i tell you my friends do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can do no more but i will show you whom you should fear fear him who after the killing of the body has power to throw you into hell yes i tell you fear him are not five sparrows sold for two pennies yet not one of them is forgotten by god indeed the very hairs of your head are all numbered dont be afraid you are worth more than many sparrows i tell you whoever acknowledges me before men the son of man will also acknowledge him before the angels of god but he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of god and everyone who speaks a word against the son of man will be forgiven but anyone who blasphemes against the holy spirit will not be forgiven when you are brought before synagogues rulers and authorities do not worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say for the holy spirit will teach you at that time what you should say someone in the crowd said to him teacher tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me jesus replied man who appointed me a judge or an arbiter between you then he said to them watch out be on your guard against all kinds of greed a mans life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions and he told them this parable the ground of a certain rich man produced a good crop he thought to himself what shall i do i have no place to store my crops then he said this is what ill do i will tear down my barns and build bigger ones and there i will store all my grain and my goods and ill say to myself you have plenty of good things laid up for many years take life easy eat drink and be merry but god said to him you fool this very night your life will be demanded from you then who will get what you have prepared for yourself this is how it will be with anyone who stores up things for himself but is not rich toward god then jesus said to his disciples therefore i tell you do not worry about your life what you will eat or about your body what you will wear life is more than food and the body more than clothes consider the ravens they do not sow or reap they have no storeroom or barn yet god feeds them and how much more valuable you are than birds who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life since you cannot do this very little thing why do you worry about the rest consider how the lilies grow they do not labor or spin yet i tell you not even solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these if that is how god clothes the grass of the field which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire how much more will he clothe you o you of little faith and do not set your heart on what you will eat or drink do not worry about it for the pagan world runs after all such things and your father knows that you need them but seek his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well do not be afraid little flock for your father has been pleased to give you the kingdom sell your possessions and give to the poor provide purses for yourselves that will not wear out a treasure in heaven that will not be exhausted where no thief comes near and no moth destroys for where your treasure is there your heart will be also be dressed ready for service and keep your lamps burning like men waiting for their master to return from a wedding banquet so that when he comes and knocks they can immediately open the door for him it will be good for those servants whose master finds them watching when he comes i tell you the truth he will dress himself to serve will have them recline at the table and will come and wait on them it will be good for those servants whose master finds them ready even if he comes in the second or third watch of the night but understand this if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming he would not have let his house be broken into you also must be ready because the son of man will come at an hour when you do not expect him peter asked lord are you telling this parable to us or to everyone the lord answered who then is the faithful and wise manager whom the master puts in charge of his servants to give them their food allowance at the proper time it will be good for that servant whom the master finds doing so when he returns i tell you the truth he will put him in charge of all his possessions but suppose the servant says to himself my master is taking a long time in coming and he then begins to beat the menservants and maidservants and to eat and drink and get drunk the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of he will cut him to pieces and assign him a place with the unbelievers that servant who knows his masters will and does not get ready or does not do what his master wants will be beaten with many blows but the one who does not know and does things deserving punishment will be beaten with few blows from everyone who has been given much much will be demanded and from the one who has been entrusted with much much more will be asked i have come to bring fire on the earth and how i wish it were already kindled but i have a baptism to undergo and how distressed i am until it is completed do you think i came to bring peace on earth no i tell you but division from now on there will be five in one family divided against each other three against two and two against three they will be divided father against son and son against father mother against daughter and daughter against mother mother in law against daughter in law and daughter in law against mother in law he said to the crowd when you see a cloud rising in the west immediately you say its going to rain and it does and when the south wind blows you say its going to be hot and it is hypocrites you know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky how is it that you dont know how to interpret this present time why dont you judge for yourselves what is right as you are going with your adversary to the magistrate try hard to be reconciled to him on the way or he may drag you off to the judge and the judge turn you over to the officer and the officer throw you into prison i tell you you will not get out until you have paid the last penny now there were some present at that time who told jesus about the galileans whose blood pilate had mixed with their sacrifices jesus answered do you think that these galileans were worse sinners than all the other galileans because they suffered this way i tell you no but unless you repent you too will all perish or those eighteen who died when the tower in siloam fell on them do you think they were more guilty than all the others living in jerusalem i tell you no but unless you repent you too will all perish then he told this parable a man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he went to look for fruit on it but did not find any so he said to the man who took care of the vineyard for three years now ive been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and havent found any cut it down why should it use up the soil sir the man replied leave it alone for one more year and ill dig around it and fertilize it if it bears fruit next year fine if not then cut it down on a sabbath jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues and a woman was there who had been crippled by a spirit for eighteen years she was bent over and could not straighten up at all when jesus saw her he called her forward and said to her woman you are set free from your infirmity then he put his hands on her and immediately she straightened up and praised god indignant because jesus had healed on the sabbath the synagogue ruler said to the people there are six days for work so come and be healed on those days not on the sabbath the lord answered him you hypocrites doesnt each of you on the sabbath untie his ox or donkey from the stall and lead it out to give it water then should not this woman a daughter of abraham whom satan has kept bound for eighteen long years be set free on the sabbath day from what bound her when he said this all his opponents were humiliated but the people were delighted with all the wonderful things he was doing then jesus asked what is the kingdom of god like what shall i compare it to it is like a mustard seed which a man took and planted in his garden it grew and became a tree and the birds of the air perched in its branches again he asked what shall i compare the kingdom of god to it is like yeast that a woman took and mixed into a large amount of flour until it worked all through the dough then jesus went through the towns and villages teaching as he made his way to jerusalem someone asked him lord are only a few people going to be saved he said to them make every effort to enter through the narrow door because many i tell you will try to enter and will not be able to once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door you will stand outside knocking and pleading sir open the door for usbut he will answer i dont know you or where you come from then you will say we ate and drank with you and you taught in our streets but he will reply i dont know you or where you come from away from me all you evildoers there will be weeping there and gnashing of teeth when you see abraham isaac and jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of god but you yourselves thrown out people will come from east and west and north and south and will take their places at the feast in the kingdom of god indeed there are those who are last who will be first and first who will be last at that time some pharisees came to jesus and said to him leave this place and go somewhere else herod wants to kill you he replied go tell that fox i will drive out demons and heal people today and tomorrow and on the third day i will reach my goal in any case i must keep going today and tomorrow and the next day for surely no prophet can die outside jerusalem o jerusalem jerusalem you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you how often i have longed to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings but you were not willing look your house is left to you desolate i tell you you will not see me again until you say blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord one sabbath when jesus went to eat in the house of a prominent pharisee he was being carefully watched there in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy jesus asked the pharisees and experts in the law is it lawful to heal on the sabbath or not but they remained silent so taking hold of the man he healed him and sent him away then he asked them if one of you has a son or an ox that falls into a well on the sabbath day will you not immediately pull him out and they had nothing to say when he noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table he told them this parable when someone invites you to a wedding feast do not take the place of honor for a person more distinguished than you may have been invited if so the host who invited both of you will come and say to you give this man your seat then humiliated you will have to take the least important place but when you are invited take the lowest place so that when your host comes he will say to you friend move up to a better place then you will be honored in the presence of all your fellow guests for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted then jesus said to his host when you give a luncheon or dinner do not invite your friends your brothers or relatives or your rich neighbors if you do they may invite you back and so you will be repaid but when you give a banquet invite the poor the crippled the lame the blind and you will be blessed although they cannot repay you you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous when one of those at the table with him heard this he said to jesus blessed is the man who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of god jesus replied a certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests at the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited come for everything is now ready but they all alike began to make excuses the first said i have just bought a field and i must go and see it please excuse me another said i have just bought five yoke of oxen and im on my way to try them out please excuse me still another said i just got married so i cant come the servant came back and reported this to his master then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor the crippled the blind and the lame sir the servant said what you ordered has been done but there is still room then the master told his servant go out to the roads and country lanes and make them come in so that my house will be full i tell you not one of those men who were invited will get a taste of my banquet large crowds were traveling with jesus and turning to them he said if anyone comes to me and does not hate his father and mother his wife and children his brothers and sisters yes even his own life he cannot be my disciple and anyone who does not carry his cross and follow me cannot be my disciple suppose one of you wants to build a tower will he not first sit down and estimate the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it for if he lays the foundation and is not able to finish it everyone who sees it will ridicule him saying this fellow began to build and was not able to finish or suppose a king is about to go to war against another king will he not first sit down and consider whether he is able with ten thousand men to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand if he is not able he will send a delegation while the other is still a long way off and will ask for terms of peace in the same way any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple salt is good but if it loses its saltiness how can it be made salty again it is fit neither for the soil nor for the manure pile it is thrown out he who has ears to hear let him hear now the tax collectors and sinners were all gathering around to hear him but the pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered this man welcomes sinners and eats with them then jesus told them this parable suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them does he not leave the ninety nine in the open country and go after the lost sheep until he finds it and when he finds it he joyfully puts it on his shoulders and goes home then he calls his friends and neighbors together and says rejoice with me i have found my lost sheep i tell you that in the same way there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety nine righteous persons who do not need to repent or suppose a woman has ten silver coins and loses one does she not light a lamp sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it and when she finds it she calls her friends and neighbors together and says rejoice with me i have found my lost coin in the same way i tell you there is rejoicing in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents jesus continued there was a man who had two sons the younger one said to his father father give me my share of the estate so he divided his property between them not long after that the younger son got together all he had set off for a distant country and there squandered his wealth in wild living after he had spent everything there was a severe famine in that whole country and he began to be in need so he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country who sent him to his fields to feed pigs he longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating but no one gave him anything when he came to his senses he said how many of my fathers hired men have food to spare and here i am starving to death i will set out and go back to my father and say to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you i am no longer worthy to be called your son make me like one of your hired men so he got up and went to his father but while he was still a long way off his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him he ran to his son threw his arms around him and kissed him the son said to him father i have sinned against heaven and against you i am no longer worthy to be called your son but the father said to his servants quick bring the best robe and put it on him put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet bring the fattened calf and kill it lets have a feast and celebrate for this son of mine was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found so they began to celebrate meanwhile the older son was in the field when he came near the house he heard music and dancing so he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on your brother has come he replied and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound the older brother became angry and refused to go in so his father went out and pleaded with him but he answered his father look all these years ive been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders yet you never gave me even a young goat so i could celebrate with my friends but when this son of yours who has squandered your property with prostitutes comes home you kill the fattened calf for him my son the father said you are always with me and everything i have is yours but we had to celebrate and be glad because this brother of yours was dead and is alive again he was lost and is found jesus told his disciples there was a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting his possessions so he called him in and asked him what is this i hear about you give an account of your management because you cannot be manager any longer the manager said to himself what shall i do now my master is taking away my job im not strong enough to dig and im ashamed to beg i know what ill do so that when i lose my job here people will welcome me into their houses so he called in each one of his masters debtors he asked the first how much do you owe my master eight hundred gallons of olive oil he replied the manager told him take your bill sit down quickly and make it four hundred then he asked the second and how much do you owea thousand bushels of wheat he replied he told him take your bill and make it eight hundred the master commended the dishonest manager because he had acted shrewdly for the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their own kind than are the people of the light i tell you use worldly wealth to gain friends for yourselves so that when it is gone you will be welcomed into eternal dwellings whoever can be trusted with very little can also be trusted with much and whoever is dishonest with very little will also be dishonest with much so if you have not been trustworthy in handling worldly wealth who will trust you with true riches and if you have not been trustworthy with someone elses property who will give you property of your own no servant can serve two masters either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money the pharisees who loved money heard all this and were sneering at jesus he said to them you are the ones who justify yourselves in the eyes of men but god knows your hearts what is highly valued among men is detestable in gods sight the law and the prophets were proclaimed until john since that time the good news of the kingdom of god is being preached and everyone is forcing his way into it it is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the law anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery and the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery there was a rich man who was dressed in purple and fine linen and lived in luxury every day at his gate was laid a beggar named lazarus covered with sores and longing to eat what fell from the rich mans table even the dogs came and licked his sores the time came when the beggar died and the angels carried him to abrahams side the rich man also died and was buried in hell where he was in torment he looked up and saw abraham far away with lazarus by his side so he called to him father abraham have pity on me and send lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue because i am in agony in this fire but abraham replied son remember that in your lifetime you received your good things while lazarus received bad things but now he is comforted here and you are in agony and besides all this between us and you a great chasm has been fixed so that those who want to go from here to you cannot nor can anyone cross over from there to us he answered then i beg you father send lazarus to my fathers house for i have five brothers let him warn them so that they will not also come to this place of torment abraham replied they have moses and the prophets let them listen to them no father abraham he said but if someone from the dead goes to them they will repent he said to him if they do not listen to moses and the prophets they will not be convinced even if someone rises from the dead jesus said to his disciples things that cause people to sin are bound to come but woe to that person through whom they come it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin so watch yourselves if your brother sins rebuke him and if he repents forgive him if he sins against you seven times in a day and seven times comes back to you and says i repent forgive him the apostles said to the lord increase our faith he replied if you have faith as small as a mustard seed you can say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea and it will obey you suppose one of you had a servant plowing or looking after the sheep would he say to the servant when he comes in from the field come along now and sit down to eat would he not rather say prepare my supper get yourself ready and wait on me while i eat and drink after that you may eat and drink would he thank the servant because he did what he was told to do so you also when you have done everything you were told to do should say we are unworthy servants we have only done our duty now on his way to jerusalem jesus traveled along the border between samaria and galilee as he was going into a village ten men who had leprosy met him they stood at a distance and called out in a loud voice jesus master have pity on us when he saw them he said go show yourselves to the priests and as they went they were cleansed one of them when he saw he was healed came back praising god in a loud voice he threw himself at jesus feet and thanked him and he was a samaritan jesus asked were not all ten cleansed where are the other nine was no one found to return and give praise to god except this foreigner then he said to him rise and go your faith has made you well once having been asked by the pharisees when the kingdom of god would come jesus replied the kingdom of god does not come with your careful observation nor will people say here it is or there it is because the kingdom of god is within you then he said to his disciples the time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the son of man but you will not see it men will tell you there he is or here he is do not go running off after them for the son of man in his day will be like the lightning which flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other but first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation just as it was in the days of noah so also will it be in the days of the son of man people were eating drinking marrying and being given in marriage up to the day noah entered the ark then the flood came and destroyed them all it was the same in the days of lot people were eating and drinking buying and selling planting and building but the day lot left sodom fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all it will be just like this on the day the son of man is revealed on that day no one who is on the roof of his house with his goods inside should go down to get them likewise no one in the field should go back for anything remember lots wife whoever tries to keep his life will lose it and whoever loses his life will preserve it i tell you on that night two people will be in one bed one will be taken and the other left two women will be grinding grain together one will be taken and the other left see footnote where lord they asked he replied where there is a dead body there the vultures will gather then jesus told his disciples a parable to show them that they should always pray and not give up he said in a certain town there was a judge who neither feared god nor cared about men and there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea grant me justice against my adversary for some time he refused but finally he said to himself even though i dont fear god or care about men yet because this widow keeps bothering me i will see that she gets justice so that she wont eventually wear me out with her coming and the lord said listen to what the unjust judge says and will not god bring about justice for his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night will he keep putting them off i tell you he will see that they get justice and quickly however when the son of man comes will he find faith on the earth to some who were confident of their own righteousness and looked down on everybody else jesus told this parable two men went up to the temple to pray one a pharisee and the other a tax collector the pharisee stood up and prayed about himself god i thank you that i am not like other men robbers evildoers adulterers or even like this tax collector i fast twice a week and give a tenth of all i get but the tax collector stood at a distance he would not even look up to heaven but beat his breast and said god have mercy on me a sinner i tell you that this man rather than the other went home justified before god for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted people were also bringing babies to jesus to have him touch them when the disciples saw this they rebuked them but jesus called the children to him and said let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it a certain ruler asked him good teacher what must i do to inherit eternal life why do you call me good jesus answered no one is good except god alone you know the commandments do not commit adultery do not murder do not steal do not give false testimony honor your father and mother all these i have kept since i was a boy he said when jesus heard this he said to him you still lack one thing sell everything you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me when he heard this he became very sad because he was a man of great wealth jesus looked at him and said how hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of god indeed it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god those who heard this asked who then can be saved jesus replied what is impossible with men is possible with god peter said to him we have left all we had to follow you i tell you the truth jesus said to them no one who has left home or wife or brothers or parents or children for the sake of the kingdom of god will fail to receive many times as much in this age and in the age to come eternal life jesus took the twelve aside and told them we are going up to jerusalem and everything that is written by the prophets about the son of man will be fulfilled he will be handed over to the gentiles they will mock him insult him spit on him flog him and kill him on the third day he will rise again the disciples did not understand any of this its meaning was hidden from them and they did not know what he was talking about as jesus approached jericho a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging when he heard the crowd going by he asked what was happening they told him jesus of nazareth is passing by he called out jesus son of david have mercy on me those who led the way rebuked him and told him to be quiet but he shouted all the more son of david have mercy on me jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him when he came near jesus asked him what do you want me to do for youlord i want to see he replied jesus said to him receive your sight your faith has healed you immediately he received his sight and followed jesus praising god when all the people saw it they also praised god jesus entered jericho and was passing through a man was there by the name of zacchaeus he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy he wanted to see who jesus was but being a short man he could not because of the crowd so he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore fig tree to see him since jesus was coming that way when jesus reached the spot he looked up and said to him zacchaeus come down immediately i must stay at your house today so he came down at once and welcomed him gladly all the people saw this and began to mutter he has gone to be the guest of a sinner but zacchaeus stood up and said to the lord look lord here and now i give half of my possessions to the poor and if i have cheated anybody out of anything i will pay back four times the amount jesus said to him today salvation has come to this house because this man too is a son of abraham for the son of man came to seek and to save what was lost while they were listening to this he went on to tell them a parable because he was near jerusalem and the people thought that the kingdom of god was going to appear at once he said a man of noble birth went to a distant country to have himself appointed king and then to return so he called ten of his servants and gave them ten minas put this money to work he said until i come back but his subjects hated him and sent a delegation after him to say we dont want this man to be our king he was made king however and returned home then he sent for the servants to whom he had given the money in order to find out what they had gained with it the first one came and said sir your mina has earned ten more well done my good servant his master replied because you have been trustworthy in a very small matter take charge of ten cities the second came and said sir your mina has earned five more his master answered you take charge of five cities then another servant came and said sir here is your mina i have kept it laid away in a piece of cloth i was afraid of you because you are a hard man you take out what you did not put in and reap what you did not sow his master replied i will judge you by your own words you wicked servant you knew did you that i am a hard man taking out what i did not put in and reaping what i did not sow why then didnt you put my money on deposit so that when i came back i could have collected it with interest then he said to those standing by take his mina away from him and give it to the one who has ten minas sir they said he already has ten he replied i tell you that to everyone who has more will be given but as for the one who has nothing even what he has will be taken away but those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them bring them here and kill them in front of me after jesus had said this he went on ahead going up to jerusalem as he approached bethphage and bethany at the hill called the mount of olives he sent two of his disciples saying to them go to the village ahead of you and as you enter it you will find a colt tied there which no one has ever ridden untie it and bring it here if anyone asks you why are you untying it tell him the lord needs it those who were sent ahead went and found it just as he had told them as they were untying the colt its owners asked them why are you untying the colt they replied the lord needs it they brought it to jesus threw their cloaks on the colt and put jesus on it as he went along people spread their cloaks on the road when he came near the place where the road goes down the mount of olives the whole crowd of disciples began joyfully to praise god in loud voices for all the miracles they had seen blessed is the king who comes in the name of the lordpeace in heaven and glory in the highest some of the pharisees in the crowd said to jesus teacher rebuke your disciples i tell you he replied if they keep quiet the stones will cry out as he approached jerusalem and saw the city he wept over it and said if you even you had only known on this day what would bring you peace but now it is hidden from your eyes the days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment against you and encircle you and hem you in on every side they will dash you to the ground you and the children within your walls they will not leave one stone on another because you did not recognize the time of gods coming to you then he entered the temple area and began driving out those who were selling it is written he said to them my house will be a house of prayer but you have made it a den of robbers every day he was teaching at the temple but the chief priests the teachers of the law and the leaders among the people were trying to kill him yet they could not find any way to do it because all the people hung on his words one day as he was teaching the people in the temple courts and preaching the gospel the chief priests and the teachers of the law together with the elders came up to him tell us by what authority you are doing these things they said who gave you this authority he replied i will also ask you a question tell me johns baptism was it from heaven or from men they discussed it among themselves and said if we say from heaven he will ask why didnt you believe him but if we say from men all the people will stone us because they are persuaded that john was a prophet so they answered we dont know where it was from jesus said neither will i tell you by what authority i am doing these things he went on to tell the people this parable a man planted a vineyard rented it to some farmers and went away for a long time at harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard but the tenants beat him and sent him away empty handed he sent another servant but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty handed he sent still a third and they wounded him and threw him out then the owner of the vineyard said what shall i do i will send my son whom i love perhaps they will respect him but when the tenants saw him they talked the matter over this is the heir they said lets kill him and the inheritance will be ours so they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him what then will the owner of the vineyard do to them he will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others when the people heard this they said may this never be jesus looked directly at them and asked then what is the meaning of that which is written the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces but he on whom it falls will be crushed the teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately because they knew he had spoken this parable against them but they were afraid of the people keeping a close watch on him they sent spies who pretended to be honest they hoped to catch jesus in something he said so that they might hand him over to the power and authority of the governor so the spies questioned him teacher we know that you speak and teach what is right and that you do not show partiality but teach the way of god in accordance with the truth is it right for us to pay taxes to caesar or not he saw through their duplicity and said to them show me a denarius whose portrait and inscription are on it caesars they replied he said to them then give to caesar what is caesars and to god what is gods they were unable to trap him in what he had said there in public and astonished by his answer they became silent some of the sadducees who say there is no resurrection came to jesus with a question teacher they said moses wrote for us that if a mans brother dies and leaves a wife but no children the man must marry the widow and have children for his brother now there were seven brothers the first one married a woman and died childless the second and then the third married her and in the same way the seven died leaving no children finally the woman died too now then at the resurrection whose wife will she be since the seven were married to her jesus replied the people of this age marry and are given in marriage but those who are considered worthy of taking part in that age and in the resurrection from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage and they can no longer die for they are like the angels they are gods children since they are children of the resurrection but in the account of the bush even moses showed that the dead rise for he calls the lord the god of abraham and the god of isaac and the god of jacob he is not the god of the dead but of the living for to him all are alive some of the teachers of the law responded well said teacher and no one dared to ask him any more questions then jesus said to them how is it that they say the christ is the son of david david himself declares in the book of psalms the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet david calls him lord how then can he be his son while all the people were listening jesus said to his disciples beware of the teachers of the law they like to walk around in flowing robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and have the most important seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets they devour widows houses and for a show make lengthy prayers such men will be punished most severely as he looked up jesus saw the rich putting their gifts into the temple treasury he also saw a poor widow put in two very small copper coins i tell you the truth he said this poor widow has put in more than all the others all these people gave their gifts out of their wealth but she out of her poverty put in all she had to live on some of his disciples were remarking about how the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and with gifts dedicated to god but jesus said as for what you see here the time will come when not one stone will be left on another every one of them will be thrown down teacher they asked when will these things happen and what will be the sign that they are about to take place he replied watch out that you are not deceived for many will come in my name claiming i am he and the time is near do not follow them when you hear of wars and revolutions do not be frightened these things must happen first but the end will not come right away then he said to them nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom there will be great earthquakes famines and pestilences in various places and fearful events and great signs from heaven but before all this they will lay hands on you and persecute you they will deliver you to synagogues and prisons and you will be brought before kings and governors and all on account of my name this will result in your being witnesses to them but make up your mind not to worry beforehand how you will defend yourselves for i will give you words and wisdom that none of your adversaries will be able to resist or contradict you will be betrayed even by parents brothers relatives and friends and they will put some of you to death all men will hate you because of me but not a hair of your head will perish by standing firm you will gain life when you see jerusalem being surrounded by armies you will know that its desolation is near then let those who are in judea flee to the mountains let those in the city get out and let those in the country not enter the city for this is the time of punishment in fulfillment of all that has been written how dreadful it will be in those days for pregnant women and nursing mothers there will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people they will fall by the sword and will be taken as prisoners to all the nations jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled there will be signs in the sun moon and stars on the earth nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea men will faint from terror apprehensive of what is coming on the world for the heavenly bodies will be shaken at that time they will see the son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory when these things begin to take place stand up and lift up your heads because your redemption is drawing near he told them this parable look at the fig tree and all the trees when they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that summer is near even so when you see these things happening you know that the kingdom of god is near i tell you the truth this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened heaven and earth will pass away but my words will never pass away be careful or your hearts will be weighed down with dissipation drunkenness and the anxieties of life and that day will close on you unexpectedly like a trap for it will come upon all those who live on the face of the whole earth be always on the watch and pray that you may be able to escape all that is about to happen and that you may be able to stand before the son of man each day jesus was teaching at the temple and each evening he went out to spend the night on the hill called the mount of olives and all the people came early in the morning to hear him at the temple now the feast of unleavened bread called the passover was approaching and the chief priests and the teachers of the law were looking for some way to get rid of jesus for they were afraid of the people then satan entered judas called iscariot one of the twelve and judas went to the chief priests and the officers of the temple guard and discussed with them how he might betray jesus they were delighted and agreed to give him money he consented and watched for an opportunity to hand jesus over to them when no crowd was present then came the day of unleavened bread on which the passover lamb had to be sacrificed jesus sent peter and john saying go and make preparations for us to eat the passover where do you want us to prepare for it they asked he replied as you enter the city a man carrying a jar of water will meet you follow him to the house that he enters and say to the owner of the house the teacher asks where is the guest room where i may eat the passover with my disciples he will show you a large upper room all furnished make preparations there they left and found things just as jesus had told them so they prepared the passover when the hour came jesus and his apostles reclined at the table and he said to them i have eagerly desired to eat this passover with you before i suffer for i tell you i will not eat it again until it finds fulfillment in the kingdom of god after taking the cup he gave thanks and said take this and divide it among you for i tell you i will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of god comes and he took bread gave thanks and broke it and gave it to them saying this is my body given for you do this in remembrance of me in the same way after the supper he took the cup saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is poured out for you but the hand of him who is going to betray me is with mine on the table the son of man will go as it has been decreed but woe to that man who betrays him they began to question among themselves which of them it might be who would do this also a dispute arose among them as to which of them was considered to be greatest jesus said to them the kings of the gentiles lord it over them and those who exercise authority over them call themselves benefactors but you are not to be like that instead the greatest among you should be like the youngest and the one who rules like the one who serves for who is greater the one who is at the table or the one who serves is it not the one who is at the table but i am among you as one who serves you are those who have stood by me in my trials and i confer on you a kingdom just as my father conferred one on me so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of israel simon simon satan has asked to sift you as wheat but i have prayed for you simon that your faith may not fail and when you have turned back strengthen your brothers but he replied lord i am ready to go with you to prison and to death jesus answered i tell you peter before the rooster crows today you will deny three times that you know me then jesus asked them when i sent you without purse bag or sandals did you lack anythingnothing they answered he said to them but now if you have a purse take it and also a bag and if you dont have a sword sell your cloak and buy one it is written and he was numbered with the transgressors and i tell you that this must be fulfilled in me yes what is written about me is reaching its fulfillment the disciples said see lord here are two swordsthat is enough he replied jesus went out as usual to the mount of olives and his disciples followed him on reaching the place he said to them pray that you will not fall into temptation he withdrew about a stones throw beyond them knelt down and prayed father if you are willing take this cup from me yet not my will but yours be done an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him and being in anguish he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground when he rose from prayer and went back to the disciples he found them asleep exhausted from sorrow why are you sleeping he asked them get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation while he was still speaking a crowd came up and the man who was called judas one of the twelve was leading them he approached jesus to kiss him but jesus asked him judas are you betraying the son of man with a kiss when jesus followers saw what was going to happen they said lord should we strike with our swords and one of them struck the servant of the high priest cutting off his right ear but jesus answered no more of this and he touched the mans ear and healed him then jesus said to the chief priests the officers of the temple guard and the elders who had come for him am i leading a rebellion that you have come with swords and clubs every day i was with you in the temple courts and you did not lay a hand on me but this is your hour when darkness reigns then seizing him they led him away and took him into the house of the high priest peter followed at a distance but when they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had sat down together peter sat down with them a servant girl saw him seated there in the firelight she looked closely at him and said this man was with him but he denied it woman i dont know him he said a little later someone else saw him and said you also are one of themman i am not peter replied about an hour later another asserted certainly this fellow was with him for he is a galilean peter replied man i dont know what youre talking about just as he was speaking the rooster crowed the lord turned and looked straight at peter then peter remembered the word the lord had spoken to him before the rooster crows today you will disown me three times and he went outside and wept bitterly the men who were guarding jesus began mocking and beating him they blindfolded him and demanded prophesy who hit you and they said many other insulting things to him at daybreak the council of the elders of the people both the chief priests and teachers of the law met together and jesus was led before them if you are the christ they said tell us jesus answered if i tell you you will not believe me and if i asked you you would not answer but from now on the son of man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty god they all asked are you then the son of god he replied you are right in saying i am then they said why do we need any more testimony we have heard it from his own lips then the whole assembly rose and led him off to pilate and they began to accuse him saying we have found this man subverting our nation he opposes payment of taxes to caesar and claims to be christ a king so pilate asked jesus are you the king of the jewsyes it is as you say jesus replied then pilate announced to the chief priests and the crowd i find no basis for a charge against this man but they insisted he stirs up the people all over judea by his teaching he started in galilee and has come all the way here on hearing this pilate asked if the man was a galilean when he learned that jesus was under herods jurisdiction he sent him to herod who was also in jerusalem at that time when herod saw jesus he was greatly pleased because for a long time he had been wanting to see him from what he had heard about him he hoped to see him perform some miracle he plied him with many questions but jesus gave him no answer the chief priests and the teachers of the law were standing there vehemently accusing him then herod and his soldiers ridiculed and mocked him dressing him in an elegant robe they sent him back to pilate that day herod and pilate became friends before this they had been enemies pilate called together the chief priests the rulers and the people and said to them you brought me this man as one who was inciting the people to rebellion i have examined him in your presence and have found no basis for your charges against him neither has herod for he sent him back to us as you can see he has done nothing to deserve death therefore i will punish him and then release him see footnote with one voice they cried out away with this man release barabbas to us barabbas had been thrown into prison for an insurrection in the city and for murder wanting to release jesus pilate appealed to them again but they kept shouting crucify him crucify him for the third time he spoke to them why what crime has this man committed i have found in him no grounds for the death penalty therefore i will have him punished and then release him but with loud shouts they insistently demanded that he be crucified and their shouts prevailed so pilate decided to grant their demand he released the man who had been thrown into prison for insurrection and murder the one they asked for and surrendered jesus to their will as they led him away they seized simon from cyrene who was on his way in from the country and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind jesus a large number of people followed him including women who mourned and wailed for him jesus turned and said to them daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me weep for yourselves and for your children for the time will come when you will say blessed are the barren women the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed then they will say to the mountains fall on us and to the hills cover us for if men do these things when the tree is green what will happen when it is dry two other men both criminals were also led out with him to be executed when they came to the place called the skull there they crucified him along with the criminals one on his right the other on his left jesus said father forgive them for they do not know what they are doing and they divided up his clothes by casting lots the people stood watching and the rulers even sneered at him they said he saved others let him save himself if he is the christ of god the chosen one the soldiers also came up and mocked him they offered him wine vinegar and said if you are the king of the jews save yourself there was a written notice above him which read|sc this is the king of the jews one of the criminals who hung there hurled insults at him arent you the christ save yourself and us but the other criminal rebuked him dont you fear god he said since you are under the same sentence we are punished justly for we are getting what our deeds deserve but this man has done nothing wrong then he said jesus remember me when you come into your kingdom jesus answered him i tell you the truth today you will be with me in paradise it was now about the sixth hour and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour for the sun stopped shining and the curtain of the temple was torn in two jesus called out with a loud voice father into your hands i commit my spirit when he had said this he breathed his last the centurion seeing what had happened praised god and said surely this was a righteous man when all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place they beat their breasts and went away but all those who knew him including the women who had followed him from galilee stood at a distance watching these things now there was a man named joseph a member of the council a good and upright man who had not consented to their decision and action he came from the judean town of arimathea and he was waiting for the kingdom of god going to pilate he asked for jesus body then he took it down wrapped it in linen cloth and placed it in a tomb cut in the rock one in which no one had yet been laid it was preparation day and the sabbath was about to begin the women who had come with jesus from galilee followed joseph and saw the tomb and how his body was laid in it then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes but they rested on the sabbath in obedience to the commandment on the first day of the week very early in the morning the women took the spices they had prepared and went to the tomb they found the stone rolled away from the tomb but when they entered they did not find the body of the lord jesus while they were wondering about this suddenly two men in clothes that gleamed like lightning stood beside them in their fright the women bowed down with their faces to the ground but the men said to them why do you look for the living among the dead he is not here he has risen remember how he told you while he was still with you in galilee the son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men be crucified and on the third day be raised again then they remembered his words when they came back from the tomb they told all these things to the eleven and to all the others it was mary magdalene joanna mary the mother of james and the others with them who told this to the apostles but they did not believe the women because their words seemed to them like nonsense peter however got up and ran to the tomb bending over he saw the strips of linen lying by themselves and he went away wondering to himself what had happened now that same day two of them were going to a village called emmaus about seven miles from jerusalem they were talking with each other about everything that had happened as they talked and discussed these things with each other jesus himself came up and walked along with them but they were kept from recognizing him he asked them what are you discussing together as you walk along they stood still their faces downcast one of them named cleopas asked him are you only a visitor to jerusalem and do not know the things that have happened there in these days what things he asked about jesus of nazareth they replied he was a prophet powerful in word and deed before god and all the people the chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death and they crucified him but we had hoped that he was the one who was going to redeem israel and what is more it is the third day since all this took place in addition some of our women amazed us they went to the tomb early this morning but didnt find his body they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels who said he was alive then some of our companions went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said but him they did not see he said to them how foolish you are and how slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken did not the christ have to suffer these things and then enter his glory and beginning with moses and all the prophets he explained to them what was said in all the scriptures concerning himself as they approached the village to which they were going jesus acted as if he were going farther but they urged him strongly stay with us for it is nearly evening the day is almost over so he went in to stay with them when he was at the table with them he took bread gave thanks broke it and began to give it to them then their eyes were opened and they recognized him and he disappeared from their sight they asked each other were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the scriptures to us they got up and returned at once to jerusalem there they found the eleven and those with them assembled together and saying it is true the lord has risen and has appeared to simon then the two told what had happened on the way and how jesus was recognized by them when he broke the bread while they were still talking about this jesus himself stood among them and said to them peace be with you they were startled and frightened thinking they saw a ghost he said to them why are you troubled and why do doubts rise in your minds look at my hands and my feet it is i myself touch me and see a ghost does not have flesh and bones as you see i have when he had said this he showed them his hands and feet and while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement he asked them do you have anything here to eat they gave him a piece of broiled fish and he took it and ate it in their presence he said to them this is what i told you while i was still with you everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the law of moses the prophets and the psalms then he opened their minds so they could understand the scriptures he told them this is what is written the christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day and repentance and forgiveness of sins will be preached in his name to all nations beginning at jerusalem you are witnesses of these things i am going to send you what my father has promised but stay in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high when he had led them out to the vicinity of bethany he lifted up his hands and blessed them while he was blessing them he left them and was taken up into heaven then they worshiped him and returned to jerusalem with great joy and they stayed continually at the temple praising god  in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god he was with god in the beginning through him all things were made without him nothing was made that has been made in him was life and that life was the light of men the light shines in the darkness but the darkness has not understood it there came a man who was sent from god his name was john he came as a witness to testify concerning that light so that through him all men might believe he himself was not the light he came only as a witness to the light the true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world he was in the world and though the world was made through him the world did not recognize him he came to that which was his own but his own did not receive him yet to all who received him to those who believed in his name he gave the right to become children of god children born not of natural descent nor of human decision or a husbands will but born of god the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth john testifies concerning him he cries out saying this was he of whom i said he who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me from the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another for the law was given through moses grace and truth came through jesus christ no one has ever seen god but god the one and only who is at the fathers side has made him known now this was johns testimony when the jews of jerusalem sent priests and levites to ask him who he was he did not fail to confess but confessed freely i am not the christ they asked him then who are you are you elijah he said i am notare you the prophet he answered no finally they said who are you give us an answer to take back to those who sent us what do you say about yourself john replied in the words of isaiah the prophet i am the voice of one calling in the desert make straight the way for the lord now some pharisees who had been sent questioned him why then do you baptize if you are not the christ nor elijah nor the prophet i baptize with water john replied but among you stands one you do not know he is the one who comes after me the thongs of whose sandals i am not worthy to untie this all happened at bethany on the other side of the jordan where john was baptizing the next day john saw jesus coming toward him and said look the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world this is the one i meant when i said a man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me i myself did not know him but the reason i came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to israel then john gave this testimony i saw the spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him i would not have known him except that the one who sent me to baptize with water told me the man on whom you see the spirit come down and remain is he who will baptize with the holy spirit i have seen and i testify that this is the son of god the next day john was there again with two of his disciples when he saw jesus passing by he said look the lamb of god when the two disciples heard him say this they followed jesus turning around jesus saw them following and asked what do you want they said rabbi which means teacher where are you staying come he replied and you will see so they went and saw where he was staying and spent that day with him it was about the tenth hour andrew simon peters brother was one of the two who heard what john had said and who had followed jesus the first thing andrew did was to find his brother simon and tell him we have found the messiah that is the christ and he brought him to jesus jesus looked at him and said you are simon son of john you will be called cephas which when translated is peter  the next day jesus decided to leave for galilee finding philip he said to him follow me philip like andrew and peter was from the town of bethsaida philip found nathanael and told him we have found the one moses wrote about in the law and about whom the prophets also wrote jesus of nazareth the son of joseph nazareth can anything good come from there nathanael asked come and see said philip when jesus saw nathanael approaching he said of him here is a true israelite in whom there is nothing false how do you know me nathanael asked jesus answered i saw you while you were still under the fig tree before philip called you then nathanael declared rabbi you are the son of god you are the king of israel jesus said you believe because i told you i saw you under the fig tree you shall see greater things than that he then added i tell you the truth you shall see heaven open and the angels of god ascending and descending on the son of man on the third day a wedding took place at cana in galilee jesus mother was there and jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding when the wine was gone jesus mother said to him they have no more wine dear woman why do you involve me jesus replied my time has not yet come his mother said to the servants do whatever he tells you nearby stood six stone water jars the kind used by the jews for ceremonial washing each holding from twenty to thirty gallons jesus said to the servants fill the jars with water so they filled them to the brim then he told them now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet they did so and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been turned into wine he did not realize where it had come from though the servants who had drawn the water knew then he called the bridegroom aside and said everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the guests have had too much to drink but you have saved the best till now this the first of his miraculous signs jesus performed in cana of galilee he thus revealed his glory and his disciples put their faith in him after this he went down to capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples there they stayed for a few days when it was almost time for the jewish passover jesus went up to jerusalem in the temple courts he found men selling cattle sheep and doves and others sitting at tables exchanging money so he made a whip out of cords and drove all from the temple area both sheep and cattle he scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables to those who sold doves he said get these out of here how dare you turn my fathers house into a market his disciples remembered that it is written zeal for your house will consume me then the jews demanded of him what miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this jesus answered them destroy this temple and i will raise it again in three days the jews replied it has taken forty six years to build this temple and you are going to raise it in three days but the temple he had spoken of was his body after he was raised from the dead his disciples recalled what he had said then they believed the scripture and the words that jesus had spoken now while he was in jerusalem at the passover feast many people saw the miraculous signs he was doing and believed in his name but jesus would not entrust himself to them for he knew all men he did not need mans testimony about man for he knew what was in a man now there was a man of the pharisees named nicodemus a member of the jewish ruling council he came to jesus at night and said rabbi we know you are a teacher who has come from god for no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if god were not with him in reply jesus declared i tell you the truth no one can see the kingdom of god unless he is born again how can a man be born when he is old nicodemus asked surely he cannot enter a second time into his mothers womb to be born jesus answered i tell you the truth no one can enter the kingdom of god unless he is born of water and the spirit flesh gives birth to flesh but the spirit gives birth to spirit you should not be surprised at my saying you must be born again the wind blows wherever it pleases you hear its sound but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it is going so it is with everyone born of the spirit how can this be nicodemus asked you are israels teacher said jesus and do you not understand these things i tell you the truth we speak of what we know and we testify to what we have seen but still you people do not accept our testimony i have spoken to you of earthly things and you do not believe how then will you believe if i speak of heavenly things no one has ever gone into heaven except the one who came from heaven the son of man just as moses lifted up the snake in the desert so the son of man must be lifted up that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but to save the world through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of gods one and only son this is the verdict light has come into the world but men loved darkness instead of light because their deeds were evil everyone who does evil hates the light and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed but whoever lives by the truth comes into the light so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through god after this jesus and his disciples went out into the judean countryside where he spent some time with them and baptized now john also was baptizing at aenon near salim because there was plenty of water and people were constantly coming to be baptized this was before john was put in prison an argument developed between some of johns disciples and a certain jew over the matter of ceremonial washing they came to john and said to him rabbi that man who was with you on the other side of the jordan the one you testified about well he is baptizing and everyone is going to him to this john replied a man can receive only what is given him from heaven you yourselves can testify that i said i am not the christ but am sent ahead of him the bride belongs to the bridegroom the friend who attends the bridegroom waits and listens for him and is full of joy when he hears the bridegrooms voice that joy is mine and it is now complete he must become greater i must become less the one who comes from above is above all the one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks as one from the earth the one who comes from heaven is above all he testifies to what he has seen and heard but no one accepts his testimony the man who has accepted it has certified that god is truthful for the one whom god has sent speaks the words of god for god gives the spirit without limit the father loves the son and has placed everything in his hands whoever believes in the son has eternal life but whoever rejects the son will not see life for gods wrath remains on him the pharisees heard that jesus was gaining and baptizing more disciples than john although in fact it was not jesus who baptized but his disciples when the lord learned of this he left judea and went back once more to galilee now he had to go through samaria so he came to a town in samaria called sychar near the plot of ground jacob had given to his son joseph jacobs well was there and jesus tired as he was from the journey sat down by the well it was about the sixth hour when a samaritan woman came to draw water jesus said to her will you give me a drink his disciples had gone into the town to buy food the samaritan woman said to him you are a jew and i am a samaritan woman how can you ask me for a drink for jews do not associate with samaritans  jesus answered her if you knew the gift of god and who it is that asks you for a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water sir the woman said you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep where can you get this living water are you greater than our father jacob who gave us the well and drank from it himself as did also his sons and his flocks and herds jesus answered everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again but whoever drinks the water i give him will never thirst indeed the water i give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life the woman said to him sir give me this water so that i wont get thirsty and have to keep coming here to draw water he told her go call your husband and come back i have no husband she replied jesus said to her you are right when you say you have no husband the fact is you have had five husbands and the man you now have is not your husband what you have just said is quite true sir the woman said i can see that you are a prophet our fathers worshiped on this mountain but you jews claim that the place where we must worship is in jerusalem jesus declared believe me woman a time is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem you samaritans worship what you do not know we worship what we do know for salvation is from the jews yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for they are the kind of worshipers the father seeks god is spirit and his worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth the woman said i know that messiah called christ is coming when he comes he will explain everything to us then jesus declared i who speak to you am he just then his disciples returned and were surprised to find him talking with a woman but no one asked what do you want or why are you talking with her then leaving her water jar the woman went back to the town and said to the people come see a man who told me everything i ever did could this be the christ they came out of the town and made their way toward him meanwhile his disciples urged him rabbi eat something but he said to them i have food to eat that you know nothing about then his disciples said to each other could someone have brought him food my food said jesus is to do the will of him who sent me and to finish his work do you not say four months more and then the harvest i tell you open your eyes and look at the fields they are ripe for harvest even now the reaper draws his wages even now he harvests the crop for eternal life so that the sower and the reaper may be glad together thus the saying one sows and another reaps is true i sent you to reap what you have not worked for others have done the hard work and you have reaped the benefits of their labor many of the samaritans from that town believed in him because of the womans testimony he told me everything i ever did so when the samaritans came to him they urged him to stay with them and he stayed two days and because of his words many more became believers they said to the woman we no longer believe just because of what you said now we have heard for ourselves and we know that this man really is the savior of the world after the two days he left for galilee now jesus himself had pointed out that a prophet has no honor in his own country when he arrived in galilee the galileans welcomed him they had seen all that he had done in jerusalem at the passover feast for they also had been there once more he visited cana in galilee where he had turned the water into wine and there was a certain royal official whose son lay sick at capernaum when this man heard that jesus had arrived in galilee from judea he went to him and begged him to come and heal his son who was close to death unless you people see miraculous signs and wonders jesus told him you will never believe the royal official said sir come down before my child dies jesus replied you may go your son will live the man took jesus at his word and departed while he was still on the way his servants met him with the news that his boy was living when he inquired as to the time when his son got better they said to him the fever left him yesterday at the seventh hour then the father realized that this was the exact time at which jesus had said to him your son will live so he and all his household believed this was the second miraculous sign that jesus performed having come from judea to galilee some time later jesus went up to jerusalem for a feast of the jews now there is in jerusalem near the sheep gate a pool which in aramaic is called bethesda and which is surrounded by five covered colonnades here a great number of disabled people used to lie the blind the lame the paralyzed see footnote one who was there had been an invalid for thirty eight years when jesus saw him lying there and learned that he had been in this condition for a long time he asked him do you want to get well sir the invalid replied i have no one to help me into the pool when the water is stirred while i am trying to get in someone else goes down ahead of me then jesus said to him get up pick up your mat and walk at once the man was cured he picked up his mat and walked the day on which this took place was a sabbath and so the jews said to the man who had been healed it is the sabbath the law forbids you to carry your mat but he replied the man who made me well said to me pick up your mat and walk so they asked him who is this fellow who told you to pick it up and walk the man who was healed had no idea who it was for jesus had slipped away into the crowd that was there later jesus found him at the temple and said to him see you are well again stop sinning or something worse may happen to you the man went away and told the jews that it was jesus who had made him well so because jesus was doing these things on the sabbath the jews persecuted him jesus said to them my father is always at his work to this very day and i too am working for this reason the jews tried all the harder to kill him not only was he breaking the sabbath but he was even calling god his own father making himself equal with god jesus gave them this answer i tell you the truth the son can do nothing by himself he can do only what he sees his father doing because whatever the father does the son also does for the father loves the son and shows him all he does yes to your amazement he will show him even greater things than these for just as the father raises the dead and gives them life even so the son gives life to whom he is pleased to give it moreover the father judges no one but has entrusted all judgment to the son that all may honor the son just as they honor the father he who does not honor the son does not honor the father who sent him i tell you the truth whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not be condemned he has crossed over from death to life i tell you the truth a time is coming and has now come when the dead will hear the voice of the son of god and those who hear will live for as the father has life in himself so he has granted the son to have life in himself and he has given him authority to judge because he is the son of man do not be amazed at this for a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out those who have done good will rise to live and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned by myself i can do nothing i judge only as i hear and my judgment is just for i seek not to please myself but him who sent me if i testify about myself my testimony is not valid there is another who testifies in my favor and i know that his testimony about me is valid you have sent to john and he has testified to the truth not that i accept human testimony but i mention it that you may be saved john was a lamp that burned and gave light and you chose for a time to enjoy his light i have testimony weightier than that of john for the very work that the father has given me to finish and which i am doing testifies that the father has sent me and the father who sent me has himself testified concerning me you have never heard his voice nor seen his form nor does his word dwell in you for you do not believe the one he sent you diligently study the scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life these are the scriptures that testify about me yet you refuse to come to me to have life i do not accept praise from men but i know you i know that you do not have the love of god in your hearts i have come in my fathers name and you do not accept me but if someone else comes in his own name you will accept him how can you believe if you accept praise from one another yet make no effort to obtain the praise that comes from the only god but do not think i will accuse you before the father your accuser is moses on whom your hopes are set if you believed moses you would believe me for he wrote about me but since you do not believe what he wrote how are you going to believe what i say some time after this jesus crossed to the far shore of the sea of galilee that is the sea of tiberias and a great crowd of people followed him because they saw the miraculous signs he had performed on the sick then jesus went up on a mountainside and sat down with his disciples the jewish passover feast was near when jesus looked up and saw a great crowd coming toward him he said to philip where shall we buy bread for these people to eat he asked this only to test him for he already had in mind what he was going to do philip answered him eight months wages would not buy enough bread for each one to have a bite another of his disciples andrew simon peters brother spoke up here is a boy with five small barley loaves and two small fish but how far will they go among so many jesus said have the people sit down there was plenty of grass in that place and the men sat down about five thousand of them jesus then took the loaves gave thanks and distributed to those who were seated as much as they wanted he did the same with the fish when they had all had enough to eat he said to his disciples gather the pieces that are left over let nothing be wasted so they gathered them and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten after the people saw the miraculous sign that jesus did they began to say surely this is the prophet who is to come into the world jesus knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force withdrew again to a mountain by himself when evening came his disciples went down to the lake where they got into a boat and set off across the lake for capernaum by now it was dark and jesus had not yet joined them a strong wind was blowing and the waters grew rough when they had rowed three or three and a half miles they saw jesus approaching the boat walking on the water and they were terrified but he said to them it is i dont be afraid then they were willing to take him into the boat and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading the next day the crowd that had stayed on the opposite shore of the lake realized that only one boat had been there and that jesus had not entered it with his disciples but that they had gone away alone then some boats from tiberias landed near the place where the people had eaten the bread after the lord had given thanks once the crowd realized that neither jesus nor his disciples were there they got into the boats and went to capernaum in search of jesus when they found him on the other side of the lake they asked him rabbi when did you get here jesus answered i tell you the truth you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill do not work for food that spoils but for food that endures to eternal life which the son of man will give you on him god the father has placed his seal of approval then they asked him what must we do to do the works god requires jesus answered the work of god is this to believe in the one he has sent so they asked him what miraculous sign then will you give that we may see it and believe you what will you do our forefathers ate the manna in the desert as it is written he gave them bread from heaven to eat jesus said to them i tell you the truth it is not moses who has given you the bread from heaven but it is my father who gives you the true bread from heaven for the bread of god is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world sir they said from now on give us this bread then jesus declared i am the bread of life he who comes to me will never go hungry and he who believes in me will never be thirsty but as i told you you have seen me and still you do not believe all that the father gives me will come to me and whoever comes to me i will never drive away for i have come down from heaven not to do my will but to do the will of him who sent me and this is the will of him who sent me that i shall lose none of all that he has given me but raise them up at the last day for my fathers will is that everyone who looks to the son and believes in him shall have eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day at this the jews began to grumble about him because he said i am the bread that came down from heaven they said is this not jesus the son of joseph whose father and mother we know how can he now say i came down from heaven stop grumbling among yourselves jesus answered no one can come to me unless the father who sent me draws him and i will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets they will all be taught by god everyone who listens to the father and learns from him comes to me no one has seen the father except the one who is from god only he has seen the father i tell you the truth he who believes has everlasting life i am the bread of life your forefathers ate the manna in the desert yet they died but here is the bread that comes down from heaven which a man may eat and not die i am the living bread that came down from heaven if anyone eats of this bread he will live forever this bread is my flesh which i will give for the life of the world then the jews began to argue sharply among themselves how can this man give us his flesh to eat jesus said to them i tell you the truth unless you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is real food and my blood is real drink whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and i in him just as the living father sent me and i live because of the father so the one who feeds on me will live because of me this is the bread that came down from heaven your forefathers ate manna and died but he who feeds on this bread will live forever he said this while teaching in the synagogue in capernaum on hearing it many of his disciples said this is a hard teaching who can accept it aware that his disciples were grumbling about this jesus said to them does this offend you what if you see the son of man ascend to where he was before the spirit gives life the flesh counts for nothing the words i have spoken to you are spirit and they are life yet there are some of you who do not believe for jesus had known from the beginning which of them did not believe and who would betray him he went on to say this is why i told you that no one can come to me unless the father has enabled him from this time many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him you do not want to leave too do you jesus asked the twelve simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go you have the words of eternal life we believe and know that you are the holy one of god then jesus replied have i not chosen you the twelve yet one of you is a devil he meant judas the son of simon iscariot who though one of the twelve was later to betray him after this jesus went around in galilee purposely staying away from judea because the jews there were waiting to take his life but when the jewish feast of tabernacles was near jesus brothers said to him you ought to leave here and go to judea so that your disciples may see the miracles you do no one who wants to become a public figure acts in secret since you are doing these things show yourself to the world for even his own brothers did not believe in him therefore jesus told them the right time for me has not yet come for you any time is right the world cannot hate you but it hates me because i testify that what it does is evil you go to the feast i am not yet going up to this feast because for me the right time has not yet come having said this he stayed in galilee however after his brothers had left for the feast he went also not publicly but in secret now at the feast the jews were watching for him and asking where is that man among the crowds there was widespread whispering about him some said he is a good man others replied no he deceives the people but no one would say anything publicly about him for fear of the jews not until halfway through the feast did jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach the jews were amazed and asked how did this man get such learning without having studied jesus answered my teaching is not my own it comes from him who sent me if anyone chooses to do gods will he will find out whether my teaching comes from god or whether i speak on my own he who speaks on his own does so to gain honor for himself but he who works for the honor of the one who sent him is a man of truth there is nothing false about him has not moses given you the law yet not one of you keeps the law why are you trying to kill me you are demon possessed the crowd answered who is trying to kill you jesus said to them i did one miracle and you are all astonished yet because moses gave you circumcision though actually it did not come from moses but from the patriarchs you circumcise a child on the sabbath now if a child can be circumcised on the sabbath so that the law of moses may not be broken why are you angry with me for healing the whole man on the sabbath stop judging by mere appearances and make a right judgment at that point some of the people of jerusalem began to ask isnt this the man they are trying to kill here he is speaking publicly and they are not saying a word to him have the authorities really concluded that he is the christ but we know where this man is from when the christ comes no one will know where he is from then jesus still teaching in the temple courts cried out yes you know me and you know where i am from i am not here on my own but he who sent me is true you do not know him but i know him because i am from him and he sent me at this they tried to seize him but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come still many in the crowd put their faith in him they said when the christ comes will he do more miraculous signs than this man the pharisees heard the crowd whispering such things about him then the chief priests and the pharisees sent temple guards to arrest him jesus said i am with you for only a short time and then i go to the one who sent me you will look for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come the jews said to one another where does this man intend to go that we cannot find him will he go where our people live scattered among the greeks and teach the greeks what did he mean when he said you will look for me but you will not find me and where i am you cannot come on the last and greatest day of the feast jesus stood and said in a loud voice if anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink whoever believes in me as the scripture has said streams of living water will flow from within him by this he meant the spirit whom those who believed in him were later to receive up to that time the spirit had not been given since jesus had not yet been glorified on hearing his words some of the people said surely this man is the prophet others said he is the christ still others asked how can the christ come from galilee does not the scripture say that the christ will come from davids family and from bethlehem the town where david lived thus the people were divided because of jesus some wanted to seize him but no one laid a hand on him finally the temple guards went back to the chief priests and pharisees who asked them why didnt you bring him in no one ever spoke the way this man does the guards declared you mean he has deceived you also the pharisees retorted has any of the rulers or of the pharisees believed in him no but this mob that knows nothing of the law there is a curse on them nicodemus who had gone to jesus earlier and who was one of their own number asked does our law condemn anyone without first hearing him to find out what he is doing they replied are you from galilee too look into it and you will find that a prophet does not come out of galilee then each went to his own home but jesus went to the mount of olives at dawn he appeared again in the temple courts where all the people gathered around him and he sat down to teach them the teachers of the law and the pharisees brought in a woman caught in adultery they made her stand before the group and said to jesus teacher this woman was caught in the act of adultery in the law moses commanded us to stone such women now what do you say they were using this question as a trap in order to have a basis for accusing him but jesus bent down and started to write on the ground with his finger when they kept on questioning him he straightened up and said to them if any one of you is without sin let him be the first to throw a stone at her again he stooped down and wrote on the ground at this those who heard began to go away one at a time the older ones first until only jesus was left with the woman still standing there jesus straightened up and asked her woman where are they has no one condemned you no one sir she said then neither do i condemn you jesus declared go now and leave your life of sin when jesus spoke again to the people he said i am the light of the world whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life the pharisees challenged him here you are appearing as your own witness your testimony is not valid jesus answered even if i testify on my own behalf my testimony is valid for i know where i came from and where i am going but you have no idea where i come from or where i am going you judge by human standards i pass judgment on no one but if i do judge my decisions are right because i am not alone i stand with the father who sent me in your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is valid i am one who testifies for myself my other witness is the father who sent me then they asked him where is your father you do not know me or my father jesus replied if you knew me you would know my father also he spoke these words while teaching in the temple area near the place where the offerings were put yet no one seized him because his time had not yet come once more jesus said to them i am going away and you will look for me and you will die in your sin where i go you cannot come this made the jews ask will he kill himself is that why he says where i go you cannot come but he continued you are from below i am from above you are of this world i am not of this world i told you that you would die in your sins if you do not believe that i am the one i claim to be you will indeed die in your sins who are you they asked just what i have been claiming all along jesus replied i have much to say in judgment of you but he who sent me is reliable and what i have heard from him i tell the world they did not understand that he was telling them about his father so jesus said when you have lifted up the son of man then you will know that i am the one i claim to be and that i do nothing on my own but speak just what the father has taught me the one who sent me is with me he has not left me alone for i always do what pleases him even as he spoke many put their faith in him to the jews who had believed him jesus said if you hold to my teaching you are really my disciples then you will know the truth and the truth will set you free they answered him we are abrahams descendants and have never been slaves of anyone how can you say that we shall be set free jesus replied i tell you the truth everyone who sins is a slave to sin now a slave has no permanent place in the family but a son belongs to it forever so if the son sets you free you will be free indeed i know you are abrahams descendants yet you are ready to kill me because you have no room for my word i am telling you what i have seen in the fathers presence and you do what you have heard from your father abraham is our father they answered if you were abrahams children said jesus then you would do the things abraham did as it is you are determined to kill me a man who has told you the truth that i heard from god abraham did not do such things you are doing the things your own father doeswe are not illegitimate children they protested the only father we have is god himself jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i came from god and now am here i have not come on my own but he sent me why is my language not clear to you because you are unable to hear what i say you belong to your father the devil and you want to carry out your fathers desire he was a murderer from the beginning not holding to the truth for there is no truth in him when he lies he speaks his native language for he is a liar and the father of lies yet because i tell the truth you do not believe me can any of you prove me guilty of sin if i am telling the truth why dont you believe me he who belongs to god hears what god says the reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to god the jews answered him arent we right in saying that you are a samaritan and demon possessed i am not possessed by a demon said jesus but i honor my father and you dishonor me i am not seeking glory for myself but there is one who seeks it and he is the judge i tell you the truth if anyone keeps my word he will never see death at this the jews exclaimed now we know that you are demon possessed abraham died and so did the prophets yet you say that if anyone keeps your word he will never taste death are you greater than our father abraham he died and so did the prophets who do you think you are jesus replied if i glorify myself my glory means nothing my father whom you claim as your god is the one who glorifies me though you do not know him i know him if i said i did not i would be a liar like you but i do know him and keep his word your father abraham rejoiced at the thought of seeing my day he saw it and was glad you are not yet fifty years old the jews said to him and you have seen abraham i tell you the truth jesus answered before abraham was born i am at this they picked up stones to stone him but jesus hid himself slipping away from the temple grounds as he went along he saw a man blind from birth his disciples asked him rabbi who sinned this man or his parents that he was born blind neither this man nor his parents sinned said jesus but this happened so that the work of god might be displayed in his life as long as it is day we must do the work of him who sent me night is coming when no one can work while i am in the world i am the light of the world having said this he spit on the ground made some mud with the saliva and put it on the mans eyes go he told him wash in the pool of siloam this word means sent so the man went and washed and came home seeing his neighbors and those who had formerly seen him begging asked isnt this the same man who used to sit and beg some claimed that he was others said no he only looks like him but he himself insisted i am the man how then were your eyes opened they demanded he replied the man they call jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes he told me to go to siloam and wash so i went and washed and then i could see where is this man they asked him i dont know he said they brought to the pharisees the man who had been blind now the day on which jesus had made the mud and opened the mans eyes was a sabbath therefore the pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight he put mud on my eyes the man replied and i washed and now i see some of the pharisees said this man is not from god for he does not keep the sabbath but others asked how can a sinner do such miraculous signs so they were divided finally they turned again to the blind man what have you to say about him it was your eyes he opened the man replied he is a prophet the jews still did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight until they sent for the mans parents is this your son they asked is this the one you say was born blind how is it that now he can see we know he is our son the parents answered and we know he was born blind but how he can see now or who opened his eyes we dont know ask him he is of age he will speak for himself his parents said this because they were afraid of the jews for already the jews had decided that anyone who acknowledged that jesus was the christ would be put out of the synagogue that was why his parents said he is of age ask him a second time they summoned the man who had been blind give glory to god they said we know this man is a sinner he replied whether he is a sinner or not i dont know one thing i do know i was blind but now i see then they asked him what did he do to you how did he open your eyes he answered i have told you already and you did not listen why do you want to hear it again do you want to become his disciples too then they hurled insults at him and said you are this fellows disciple we are disciples of moses we know that god spoke to moses but as for this fellow we dont even know where he comes from the man answered now that is remarkable you dont know where he comes from yet he opened my eyes we know that god does not listen to sinners he listens to the godly man who does his will nobody has ever heard of opening the eyes of a man born blind if this man were not from god he could do nothing to this they replied you were steeped in sin at birth how dare you lecture us and they threw him out jesus heard that they had thrown him out and when he found him he said do you believe in the son of man who is he sir the man asked tell me so that i may believe in him jesus said you have now seen him in fact he is the one speaking with you then the man said lord i believe and he worshiped him jesus said for judgment i have come into this world so that the blind will see and those who see will become blind some pharisees who were with him heard him say this and asked what are we blind too jesus said if you were blind you would not be guilty of sin but now that you claim you can see your guilt remains i tell you the truth the man who does not enter the sheep pen by the gate but climbs in by some other way is a thief and a robber the man who enters by the gate is the shepherd of his sheep the watchman opens the gate for him and the sheep listen to his voice he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out when he has brought out all his own he goes on ahead of them and his sheep follow him because they know his voice but they will never follow a stranger in fact they will run away from him because they do not recognize a strangers voice jesus used this figure of speech but they did not understand what he was telling them therefore jesus said again i tell you the truth i am the gate for the sheep all who ever came before me were thieves and robbers but the sheep did not listen to them i am the gate whoever enters through me will be saved he will come in and go out and find pasture the thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy i have come that they may have life and have it to the full i am the good shepherd the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep the hired hand is not the shepherd who owns the sheep so when he sees the wolf coming he abandons the sheep and runs away then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it the man runs away because he is a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep i am the good shepherd i know my sheep and my sheep know me just as the father knows me and i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep i have other sheep that are not of this sheep pen i must bring them also they too will listen to my voice and there shall be one flock and one shepherd the reason my father loves me is that i lay down my life only to take it up again no one takes it from me but i lay it down of my own accord i have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again this command i received from my father at these words the jews were again divided many of them said he is demon possessed and raving mad why listen to him but others said these are not the sayings of a man possessed by a demon can a demon open the eyes of the blind then came the feast of dedication at jerusalem it was winter and jesus was in the temple area walking in solomons colonnade the jews gathered around him saying how long will you keep us in suspense if you are the christ tell us plainly jesus answered i did tell you but you do not believe the miracles i do in my fathers name speak for me but you do not believe because you are not my sheep my sheep listen to my voice i know them and they follow me i give them eternal life and they shall never perish no one can snatch them out of my hand my father who has given them to me is greater than all no one can snatch them out of my fathers hand i and the father are one again the jews picked up stones to stone him but jesus said to them i have shown you many great miracles from the father for which of these do you stone me we are not stoning you for any of these replied the jews but for blasphemy because you a mere man claim to be god jesus answered them is it not written in your law i have said you are gods if he called them gods to whom the word of god came and the scripture cannot be broken what about the one whom the father set apart as his very own and sent into the world why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because i said i am gods son do not believe me unless i do what my father does but if i do it even though you do not believe me believe the miracles that you may know and understand that the father is in me and i in the father again they tried to seize him but he escaped their grasp then jesus went back across the jordan to the place where john had been baptizing in the early days here he stayed and many people came to him they said though john never performed a miraculous sign all that john said about this man was true and in that place many believed in jesus now a man named lazarus was sick he was from bethany the village of mary and her sister martha this mary whose brother lazarus now lay sick was the same one who poured perfume on the lord and wiped his feet with her hair so the sisters sent word to jesus lord the one you love is sick when he heard this jesus said this sickness will not end in death no it is for gods glory so that gods son may be glorified through it jesus loved martha and her sister and lazarus yet when he heard that lazarus was sick he stayed where he was two more days then he said to his disciples let us go back to judea but rabbi they said a short while ago the jews tried to stone you and yet you are going back there jesus answered are there not twelve hours of daylight a man who walks by day will not stumble for he sees by this worlds light it is when he walks by night that he stumbles for he has no light after he had said this he went on to tell them our friend lazarus has fallen asleep but i am going there to wake him up his disciples replied lord if he sleeps he will get better jesus had been speaking of his death but his disciples thought he meant natural sleep so then he told them plainly lazarus is dead and for your sake i am glad i was not there so that you may believe but let us go to him then thomas called didymus said to the rest of the disciples let us also go that we may die with him on his arrival jesus found that lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days bethany was less than two miles from jerusalem and many jews had come to martha and mary to comfort them in the loss of their brother when martha heard that jesus was coming she went out to meet him but mary stayed at home lord martha said to jesus if you had been here my brother would not have died but i know that even now god will give you whatever you ask jesus said to her your brother will rise again martha answered i know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day jesus said to her i am the resurrection and the life he who believes in me will live even though he dies and whoever lives and believes in me will never die do you believe this yes lord she told him i believe that you are the christ the son of god who was to come into the world and after she had said this she went back and called her sister mary aside the teacher is here she said and is asking for you when mary heard this she got up quickly and went to him now jesus had not yet entered the village but was still at the place where martha had met him when the jews who had been with mary in the house comforting her noticed how quickly she got up and went out they followed her supposing she was going to the tomb to mourn there when mary reached the place where jesus was and saw him she fell at his feet and said lord if you had been here my brother would not have died when jesus saw her weeping and the jews who had come along with her also weeping he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled where have you laid him he asked come and see lord they replied jesus wept then the jews said see how he loved him but some of them said could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying jesus once more deeply moved came to the tomb it was a cave with a stone laid across the entrance take away the stone he said but lord said martha the sister of the dead man by this time there is a bad odor for he has been there four days then jesus said did i not tell you that if you believed you would see the glory of god so they took away the stone then jesus looked up and said father i thank you that you have heard me i knew that you always hear me but i said this for the benefit of the people standing here that they may believe that you sent me when he had said this jesus called in a loud voice lazarus come out the dead man came out his hands and feet wrapped with strips of linen and a cloth around his face jesus said to them take off the grave clothes and let him go therefore many of the jews who had come to visit mary and had seen what jesus did put their faith in him but some of them went to the pharisees and told them what jesus had done then the chief priests and the pharisees called a meeting of the sanhedrin what are we accomplishing they asked here is this man performing many miraculous signs if we let him go on like this everyone will believe in him and then the romans will come and take away both our place and our nation then one of them named caiaphas who was high priest that year spoke up you know nothing at all you do not realize that it is better for you that one man die for the people than that the whole nation perish he did not say this on his own but as high priest that year he prophesied that jesus would die for the jewish nation and not only for that nation but also for the scattered children of god to bring them together and make them one so from that day on they plotted to take his life therefore jesus no longer moved about publicly among the jews instead he withdrew to a region near the desert to a village called ephraim where he stayed with his disciples when it was almost time for the jewish passover many went up from the country to jerusalem for their ceremonial cleansing before the passover they kept looking for jesus and as they stood in the temple area they asked one another what do you think isnt he coming to the feast at all but the chief priests and pharisees had given orders that if anyone found out where jesus was he should report it so that they might arrest him six days before the passover jesus arrived at bethany where lazarus lived whom jesus had raised from the dead here a dinner was given in jesus honor martha served while lazarus was among those reclining at the table with him then mary took about a pint of pure nard an expensive perfume she poured it on jesus feet and wiped his feet with her hair and the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume but one of his disciples judas iscariot who was later to betray him objected why wasnt this perfume sold and the money given to the poor it was worth a years wages he did not say this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief as keeper of the money bag he used to help himself to what was put into it leave her alone jesus replied it was intended that she should save this perfume for the day of my burial you will always have the poor among you but you will not always have me meanwhile a large crowd of jews found out that jesus was there and came not only because of him but also to see lazarus whom he had raised from the dead so the chief priests made plans to kill lazarus as well for on account of him many of the jews were going over to jesus and putting their faith in him the next day the great crowd that had come for the feast heard that jesus was on his way to jerusalem they took palm branches and went out to meet him shouting hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lordblessed is the king of israel jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it as it is written do not be afraid o daughter of zion see your king is coming seated on a donkeys colt at first his disciples did not understand all this only after jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him now the crowd that was with him when he called lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word many people because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign went out to meet him so the pharisees said to one another see this is getting us nowhere look how the whole world has gone after him now there were some greeks among those who went up to worship at the feast they came to philip who was from bethsaida in galilee with a request sir they said we would like to see jesus philip went to tell andrew andrew and philip in turn told jesus jesus replied the hour has come for the son of man to be glorified i tell you the truth unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies it remains only a single seed but if it dies it produces many seeds the man who loves his life will lose it while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life whoever serves me must follow me and where i am my servant also will be my father will honor the one who serves me now my heart is troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour no it was for this very reason i came to this hour father glorify your name then a voice came from heaven i have glorified it and will glorify it again the crowd that was there and heard it said it had thundered others said an angel had spoken to him jesus said this voice was for your benefit not mine now is the time for judgment on this world now the prince of this world will be driven out but i when i am lifted up from the earth will draw all men to myself he said this to show the kind of death he was going to die the crowd spoke up we have heard from the law that the christ will remain forever so how can you say the son of man must be lifted up who is this son of man then jesus told them you are going to have the light just a little while longer walk while you have the light before darkness overtakes you the man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going put your trust in the light while you have it so that you may become sons of light when he had finished speaking jesus left and hid himself from them even after jesus had done all these miraculous signs in their presence they still would not believe in him this was to fulfill the word of isaiah the prophet lord who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the lord been revealed for this reason they could not believe because as isaiah says elsewhere he has blinded their eyes and deadened their hearts so they can neither see with their eyes nor understand with their hearts nor turn and i would heal them isaiah said this because he saw jesus glory and spoke about him yet at the same time many even among the leaders believed in him but because of the pharisees they would not confess their faith for fear they would be put out of the synagogue for they loved praise from men more than praise from god then jesus cried out when a man believes in me he does not believe in me only but in the one who sent me when he looks at me he sees the one who sent me i have come into the world as a light so that no one who believes in me should stay in darkness as for the person who hears my words but does not keep them i do not judge him for i did not come to judge the world but to save it there is a judge for the one who rejects me and does not accept my words that very word which i spoke will condemn him at the last day for i did not speak of my own accord but the father who sent me commanded me what to say and how to say it i know that his command leads to eternal life so whatever i say is just what the father has told me to say it was just before the passover feast jesus knew that the time had come for him to leave this world and go to the father having loved his own who were in the world he now showed them the full extent of his love the evening meal was being served and the devil had already prompted judas iscariot son of simon to betray jesus jesus knew that the father had put all things under his power and that he had come from god and was returning to god so he got up from the meal took off his outer clothing and wrapped a towel around his waist after that he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples feet drying them with the towel that was wrapped around him he came to simon peter who said to him lord are you going to wash my feet jesus replied you do not realize now what i am doing but later you will understand no said peter you shall never wash my feet jesus answered unless i wash you you have no part with me then lord simon peter replied not just my feet but my hands and my head as well jesus answered a person who has had a bath needs only to wash his feet his whole body is clean and you are clean though not every one of you for he knew who was going to betray him and that was why he said not every one was clean when he had finished washing their feet he put on his clothes and returned to his place do you understand what i have done for you he asked them you call me teacher and lord and rightly so for that is what i am now that i your lord and teacher have washed your feet you also should wash one anothers feet i have set you an example that you should do as i have done for you i tell you the truth no servant is greater than his master nor is a messenger greater than the one who sent him now that you know these things you will be blessed if you do them i am not referring to all of you i know those i have chosen but this is to fulfill the scripture he who shares my bread has lifted up his heel against me i am telling you now before it happens so that when it does happen you will believe that i am he i tell you the truth whoever accepts anyone i send accepts me and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me after he had said this jesus was troubled in spirit and testified i tell you the truth one of you is going to betray me his disciples stared at one another at a loss to know which of them he meant one of them the disciple whom jesus loved was reclining next to him simon peter motioned to this disciple and said ask him which one he means leaning back against jesus he asked him lord who is it jesus answered it is the one to whom i will give this piece of bread when i have dipped it in the dish then dipping the piece of bread he gave it to judas iscariot son of simon as soon as judas took the bread satan entered into him what you are about to do do quickly jesus told him but no one at the meal understood why jesus said this to him since judas had charge of the money some thought jesus was telling him to buy what was needed for the feast or to give something to the poor as soon as judas had taken the bread he went out and it was night when he was gone jesus said now is the son of man glorified and god is glorified in him if god is glorified in him god will glorify the son in himself and will glorify him at once my children i will be with you only a little longer you will look for me and just as i told the jews so i tell you now where i am going you cannot come a new command i give you love one another as i have loved you so you must love one another by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you love one another simon peter asked him lord where are you going jesus replied where i am going you cannot follow now but you will follow later peter asked lord why cant i follow you now i will lay down my life for you then jesus answered will you really lay down your life for me i tell you the truth before the rooster crows you will disown me three times do not let your hearts be troubled trust in god trust also in me in my fathers house are many rooms if it were not so i would have told you i am going there to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where i am you know the way to the place where i am going thomas said to him lord we dont know where you are going so how can we know the way jesus answered i am the way and the truth and the life no one comes to the father except through me if you really knew me you would know my father as well from now on you do know him and have seen him philip said lord show us the father and that will be enough for us jesus answered dont you know me philip even after i have been among you such a long time anyone who has seen me has seen the father how can you say show us the father dont you believe that i am in the father and that the father is in me the words i say to you are not just my own rather it is the father living in me who is doing his work believe me when i say that i am in the father and the father is in me or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves i tell you the truth anyone who has faith in me will do what i have been doing he will do even greater things than these because i am going to the father and i will do whatever you ask in my name so that the son may bring glory to the father you may ask me for anything in my name and i will do it if you love me you will obey what i command and i will ask the father and he will give you another counselor to be with you forever the spirit of truth the world cannot accept him because it neither sees him nor knows him but you know him for he lives with you and will be in you i will not leave you as orphans i will come to you before long the world will not see me anymore but you will see me because i live you also will live on that day you will realize that i am in my father and you are in me and i am in you whoever has my commands and obeys them he is the one who loves me he who loves me will be loved by my father and i too will love him and show myself to him then judas not judas iscariot said but lord why do you intend to show yourself to us and not to the world jesus replied if anyone loves me he will obey my teaching my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him he who does not love me will not obey my teaching these words you hear are not my own they belong to the father who sent me all this i have spoken while still with you but the counselor the holy spirit whom the father will send in my name will teach you all things and will remind you of everything i have said to you peace i leave with you my peace i give you i do not give to you as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid you heard me say i am going away and i am coming back to you if you loved me you would be glad that i am going to the father for the father is greater than i i have told you now before it happens so that when it does happen you will believe i will not speak with you much longer for the prince of this world is coming he has no hold on me but the world must learn that i love the father and that i do exactly what my father has commanded me come now let us leave i am the true vine and my father is the gardener he cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful you are already clean because of the word i have spoken to you remain in me and i will remain in you no branch can bear fruit by itself it must remain in the vine neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me i am the vine you are the branches if a man remains in me and i in him he will bear much fruit apart from me you can do nothing if anyone does not remain in me he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers such branches are picked up thrown into the fire and burned if you remain in me and my words remain in you ask whatever you wish and it will be given you this is to my fathers glory that you bear much fruit showing yourselves to be my disciples as the father has loved me so have i loved you now remain in my love if you obey my commands you will remain in my love just as i have obeyed my fathers commands and remain in his love i have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete my command is this love each other as i have loved you greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends you are my friends if you do what i command i no longer call you servants because a servant does not know his masters business instead i have called you friends for everything that i learned from my father i have made known to you you did not choose me but i chose you and appointed you to go and bear fruit fruit that will last then the father will give you whatever you ask in my name this is my command love each other if the world hates you keep in mind that it hated me first if you belonged to the world it would love you as its own as it is you do not belong to the world but i have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you remember the words i spoke to you no servant is greater than his master if they persecuted me they will persecute you also if they obeyed my teaching they will obey yours also they will treat you this way because of my name for they do not know the one who sent me if i had not come and spoken to them they would not be guilty of sin now however they have no excuse for their sin he who hates me hates my father as well if i had not done among them what no one else did they would not be guilty of sin but now they have seen these miracles and yet they have hated both me and my father but this is to fulfill what is written in their law they hated me without reason when the counselor comes whom i will send to you from the father the spirit of truth who goes out from the father he will testify about me and you also must testify for you have been with me from the beginning all this i have told you so that you will not go astray they will put you out of the synagogue in fact a time is coming when anyone who kills you will think he is offering a service to god they will do such things because they have not known the father or me i have told you this so that when the time comes you will remember that i warned you i did not tell you this at first because i was with you now i am going to him who sent me yet none of you asks me where are you going because i have said these things you are filled with grief but i tell you the truth it is for your good that i am going away unless i go away the counselor will not come to you but if i go i will send him to you when he comes he will convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment in regard to sin because men do not believe in me in regard to righteousness because i am going to the father where you can see me no longer and in regard to judgment because the prince of this world now stands condemned i have much more to say to you more than you can now bear but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide you into all truth he will not speak on his own he will speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is yet to come he will bring glory to me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you all that belongs to the father is mine that is why i said the spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you in a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me some of his disciples said to one another what does he mean by saying in a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me and because i am going to the father they kept asking what does he mean by a little while we dont understand what he is saying jesus saw that they wanted to ask him about this so he said to them are you asking one another what i meant when i said in a little while you will see me no more and then after a little while you will see me i tell you the truth you will weep and mourn while the world rejoices you will grieve but your grief will turn to joy a woman giving birth to a child has pain because her time has come but when her baby is born she forgets the anguish because of her joy that a child is born into the world so with you now is your time of grief but i will see you again and you will rejoice and no one will take away your joy in that day you will no longer ask me anything i tell you the truth my father will give you whatever you ask in my name until now you have not asked for anything in my name ask and you will receive and your joy will be complete though i have been speaking figuratively a time is coming when i will no longer use this kind of language but will tell you plainly about my father in that day you will ask in my name i am not saying that i will ask the father on your behalf no the father himself loves you because you have loved me and have believed that i came from god i came from the father and entered the world now i am leaving the world and going back to the father then jesus disciples said now you are speaking clearly and without figures of speech now we can see that you know all things and that you do not even need to have anyone ask you questions this makes us believe that you came from god you believe at last jesus answered but a time is coming and has come when you will be scattered each to his own home you will leave me all alone yet i am not alone for my father is with me i have told you these things so that in me you may have peace in this world you will have trouble but take heart i have overcome the world after jesus said this he looked toward heaven and prayed father the time has come glorify your son that your son may glorify you for you granted him authority over all people that he might give eternal life to all those you have given him now this is eternal life that they may know you the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent i have brought you glory on earth by completing the work you gave me to do and now father glorify me in your presence with the glory i had with you before the world began i have revealed you to those whom you gave me out of the world they were yours you gave them to me and they have obeyed your word now they know that everything you have given me comes from you for i gave them the words you gave me and they accepted them they knew with certainty that i came from you and they believed that you sent me i pray for them i am not praying for the world but for those you have given me for they are yours all i have is yours and all you have is mine and glory has come to me through them i will remain in the world no longer but they are still in the world and i am coming to you holy father protect them by the power of your name the name you gave me so that they may be one as we are one while i was with them i protected them and kept them safe by that name you gave me none has been lost except the one doomed to destruction so that scripture would be fulfilled i am coming to you now but i say these things while i am still in the world so that they may have the full measure of my joy within them i have given them your word and the world has hated them for they are not of the world any more than i am of the world my prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one they are not of the world even as i am not of it sanctify them by the truth your word is truth as you sent me into the world i have sent them into the world for them i sanctify myself that they too may be truly sanctified my prayer is not for them alone i pray also for those who will believe in me through their message that all of them may be one father just as you are in me and i am in you may they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me i have given them the glory that you gave me that they may be one as we are one i in them and you in me may they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me father i want those you have given me to be with me where i am and to see my glory the glory you have given me because you loved me before the creation of the world righteous father though the world does not know you i know you and they know that you have sent me i have made you known to them and will continue to make you known in order that the love you have for me may be in them and that i myself may be in them when he had finished praying jesus left with his disciples and crossed the kidron valley on the other side there was an olive grove and he and his disciples went into it now judas who betrayed him knew the place because jesus had often met there with his disciples so judas came to the grove guiding a detachment of soldiers and some officials from the chief priests and pharisees they were carrying torches lanterns and weapons jesus knowing all that was going to happen to him went out and asked them who is it you want jesus of nazareth they replied i am he jesus said and judas the traitor was standing there with them when jesus said i am he they drew back and fell to the ground again he asked them who is it you want and they said jesus of nazareth i told you that i am he jesus answered if you are looking for me then let these men go this happened so that the words he had spoken would be fulfilled i have not lost one of those you gave me then simon peter who had a sword drew it and struck the high priests servant cutting off his right ear the servants name was malchus jesus commanded peter put your sword away shall i not drink the cup the father has given me then the detachment of soldiers with its commander and the jewish officials arrested jesus they bound him and brought him first to annas who was the father in law of caiaphas the high priest that year caiaphas was the one who had advised the jews that it would be good if one man died for the people simon peter and another disciple were following jesus because this disciple was known to the high priest he went with jesus into the high priests courtyard but peter had to wait outside at the door the other disciple who was known to the high priest came back spoke to the girl on duty there and brought peter in you are not one of his disciples are you the girl at the door asked peter he replied i am not it was cold and the servants and officials stood around a fire they had made to keep warm peter also was standing with them warming himself meanwhile the high priest questioned jesus about his disciples and his teaching i have spoken openly to the world jesus replied i always taught in synagogues or at the temple where all the jews come together i said nothing in secret why question me ask those who heard me surely they know what i said when jesus said this one of the officials nearby struck him in the face is this the way you answer the high priest he demanded if i said something wrong jesus replied testify as to what is wrong but if i spoke the truth why did you strike me then annas sent him still bound to caiaphas the high priest as simon peter stood warming himself he was asked you are not one of his disciples are you he denied it saying i am not one of the high priests servants a relative of the man whose ear peter had cut off challenged him didnt i see you with him in the olive grove again peter denied it and at that moment a rooster began to crow then the jews led jesus from caiaphas to the palace of the roman governor by now it was early morning and to avoid ceremonial uncleanness the jews did not enter the palace they wanted to be able to eat the passover so pilate came out to them and asked what charges are you bringing against this man if he were not a criminal they replied we would not have handed him over to you pilate said take him yourselves and judge him by your own law but we have no right to execute anyone the jews objected this happened so that the words jesus had spoken indicating the kind of death he was going to die would be fulfilled pilate then went back inside the palace summoned jesus and asked him are you the king of the jews is that your own idea jesus asked or did others talk to you about me am i a jew pilate replied it was your people and your chief priests who handed you over to me what is it you have done jesus said my kingdom is not of this world if it were my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the jews but now my kingdom is from another place you are a king then said pilate jesus answered you are right in saying i am a king in fact for this reason i was born and for this i came into the world to testify to the truth everyone on the side of truth listens to me what is truth pilate asked with this he went out again to the jews and said i find no basis for a charge against him but it is your custom for me to release to you one prisoner at the time of the passover do you want me to release the king of the jews they shouted back no not him give us barabbas now barabbas had taken part in a rebellion then pilate took jesus and had him flogged the soldiers twisted together a crown of thorns and put it on his head they clothed him in a purple robe and went up to him again and again saying hail king of the jews and they struck him in the face once more pilate came out and said to the jews look i am bringing him out to you to let you know that i find no basis for a charge against him when jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe pilate said to them here is the man as soon as the chief priests and their officials saw him they shouted crucify crucify but pilate answered you take him and crucify him as for me i find no basis for a charge against him the jews insisted we have a law and according to that law he must die because he claimed to be the son of god when pilate heard this he was even more afraid and he went back inside the palace where do you come from he asked jesus but jesus gave him no answer do you refuse to speak to me pilate said dont you realize i have power either to free you or to crucify you jesus answered you would have no power over me if it were not given to you from above therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin from then on pilate tried to set jesus free but the jews kept shouting if you let this man go you are no friend of caesar anyone who claims to be a king opposes caesar when pilate heard this he brought jesus out and sat down on the judges seat at a place known as the stone pavement which in aramaic is gabbatha it was the day of preparation of passover week about the sixth hour here is your king pilate said to the jews but they shouted take him away take him away crucify himshall i crucify your king pilate asked we have no king but caesar the chief priests answered finally pilate handed him over to them to be crucified so the soldiers took charge of jesus carrying his own cross he went out to the place of the skull which in aramaic is called golgotha here they crucified him and with him two others one on each side and jesus in the middle pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross it read|sc jesus of nazareth the king of the jews many of the jews read this sign for the place where jesus was crucified was near the city and the sign was written in aramaic latin and greek the chief priests of the jews protested to pilate do not write the king of the jews but that this man claimed to be king of the jews pilate answered what i have written i have written when the soldiers crucified jesus they took his clothes dividing them into four shares one for each of them with the undergarment remaining this garment was seamless woven in one piece from top to bottom lets not tear it they said to one another lets decide by lot who will get it this happened that the scripture might be fulfilled which said they divided my garments among them and cast lots for my clothing so this is what the soldiers did near the cross of jesus stood his mother his mothers sister mary the wife of clopas and mary magdalene when jesus saw his mother there and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby he said to his mother dear woman here is your son and to the disciple here is your mother from that time on this disciple took her into his home later knowing that all was now completed and so that the scripture would be fulfilled jesus said i am thirsty a jar of wine vinegar was there so they soaked a sponge in it put the sponge on a stalk of the hyssop plant and lifted it to jesus lips when he had received the drink jesus said it is finished with that he bowed his head and gave up his spirit now it was the day of preparation and the next day was to be a special sabbath because the jews did not want the bodies left on the crosses during the sabbath they asked pilate to have the legs broken and the bodies taken down the soldiers therefore came and broke the legs of the first man who had been crucified with jesus and then those of the other but when they came to jesus and found that he was already dead they did not break his legs instead one of the soldiers pierced jesus side with a spear bringing a sudden flow of blood and water the man who saw it has given testimony and his testimony is true he knows that he tells the truth and he testifies so that you also may believe these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled not one of his bones will be broken and as another scripture says they will look on the one they have pierced later joseph of arimathea asked pilate for the body of jesus now joseph was a disciple of jesus but secretly because he feared the jews with pilates permission he came and took the body away he was accompanied by nicodemus the man who earlier had visited jesus at night nicodemus brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes about seventy five pounds taking jesus body the two of them wrapped it with the spices in strips of linen this was in accordance with jewish burial customs at the place where jesus was crucified there was a garden and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid because it was the jewish day of preparation and since the tomb was nearby they laid jesus there early on the first day of the week while it was still dark mary magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance so she came running to simon peter and the other disciple the one jesus loved and said they have taken the lord out of the tomb and we dont know where they have put him so peter and the other disciple started for the tomb both were running but the other disciple outran peter and reached the tomb first he bent over and looked in at the strips of linen lying there but did not go in then simon peter who was behind him arrived and went into the tomb he saw the strips of linen lying there as well as the burial cloth that had been around jesus head the cloth was folded up by itself separate from the linen finally the other disciple who had reached the tomb first also went inside he saw and believed they still did not understand from scripture that jesus had to rise from the dead then the disciples went back to their homes but mary stood outside the tomb crying as she wept she bent over to look into the tomb and saw two angels in white seated where jesus body had been one at the head and the other at the foot they asked her woman why are you crying they have taken my lord away she said and i dont know where they have put him at this she turned around and saw jesus standing there but she did not realize that it was jesus woman he said why are you crying who is it you are looking for thinking he was the gardener she said sir if you have carried him away tell me where you have put him and i will get him jesus said to her mary she turned toward him and cried out in aramaic rabboni which means teacher jesus said do not hold on to me for i have not yet returned to the father go instead to my brothers and tell them i am returning to my father and your father to my god and your god mary magdalene went to the disciples with the news i have seen the lord and she told them that he had said these things to her on the evening of that first day of the week when the disciples were together with the doors locked for fear of the jews jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you after he said this he showed them his hands and side the disciples were overjoyed when they saw the lord again jesus said peace be with you as the father has sent me i am sending you and with that he breathed on them and said receive the holy spirit if you forgive anyone his sins they are forgiven if you do not forgive them they are not forgiven now thomas called didymus one of the twelve was not with the disciples when jesus came so the other disciples told him we have seen the lord but he said to them unless i see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger where the nails were and put my hand into his side i will not believe it a week later his disciples were in the house again and thomas was with them though the doors were locked jesus came and stood among them and said peace be with you then he said to thomas put your finger here see my hands reach out your hand and put it into my side stop doubting and believe thomas said to him my lord and my god then jesus told him because you have seen me you have believed blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples which are not recorded in this book but these are written that you may believe that jesus is the christ the son of god and that by believing you may have life in his name afterward jesus appeared again to his disciples by the sea of tiberias it happened this way simon peter thomas called didymus nathanael from cana in galilee the sons of zebedee and two other disciples were together im going out to fish simon peter told them and they said well go with you so they went out and got into the boat but that night they caught nothing early in the morning jesus stood on the shore but the disciples did not realize that it was jesus he called out to them friends havent you any fishno they answered he said throw your net on the right side of the boat and you will find some when they did they were unable to haul the net in because of the large number of fish then the disciple whom jesus loved said to peter it is the lord as soon as simon peter heard him say it is the lord he wrapped his outer garment around him for he had taken it off and jumped into the water the other disciples followed in the boat towing the net full of fish for they were not far from shore about a hundred yards when they landed they saw a fire of burning coals there with fish on it and some bread jesus said to them bring some of the fish you have just caught simon peter climbed aboard and dragged the net ashore it was full of large fish 153 but even with so many the net was not torn jesus said to them come and have breakfast none of the disciples dared ask him who are you they knew it was the lord jesus came took the bread and gave it to them and did the same with the fish this was now the third time jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead when they had finished eating jesus said to simon peter simon son of john do you truly love me more than theseyes lord he said you know that i love you jesus said feed my lambs again jesus said simon son of john do you truly love me he answered yes lord you know that i love you jesus said take care of my sheep the third time he said to him simon son of john do you love me peter was hurt because jesus asked him the third time do you love me he said lord you know all things you know that i love you jesus said feed my sheep i tell you the truth when you were younger you dressed yourself and went where you wanted but when you are old you will stretch out your hands and someone else will dress you and lead you where you do not want to go jesus said this to indicate the kind of death by which peter would glorify god then he said to him follow me peter turned and saw that the disciple whom jesus loved was following them this was the one who had leaned back against jesus at the supper and had said lord who is going to betray you when peter saw him he asked lord what about him jesus answered if i want him to remain alive until i return what is that to you you must follow me because of this the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple would not die but jesus did not say that he would not die he only said if i want him to remain alive until i return what is that to you this is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down we know that his testimony is true jesus did many other things as well if every one of them were written down i suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written  in my former book theophilus i wrote about all that jesus began to do and to teach until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving instructions through the holy spirit to the apostles he had chosen after his suffering he showed himself to these men and gave many convincing proofs that he was alive he appeared to them over a period of forty days and spoke about the kingdom of god on one occasion while he was eating with them he gave them this command do not leave jerusalem but wait for the gift my father promised which you have heard me speak about for john baptized with water but in a few days you will be baptized with the holy spirit so when they met together they asked him lord are you at this time going to restore the kingdom to israel he said to them it is not for you to know the times or dates the father has set by his own authority but you will receive power when the holy spirit comes on you and you will be my witnesses in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the ends of the earth after he said this he was taken up before their very eyes and a cloud hid him from their sight they were looking intently up into the sky as he was going when suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them men of galilee they said why do you stand here looking into the sky this same jesus who has been taken from you into heaven will come back in the same way you have seen him go into heaven then they returned to jerusalem from the hill called the mount of olives a sabbath days walk from the city when they arrived they went upstairs to the room where they were staying those present were peter john james and andrew philip and thomas bartholomew and matthew james son of alphaeus and simon the zealot and judas son of james they all joined together constantly in prayer along with the women and mary the mother of jesus and with his brothers in those days peter stood up among the believers a group numbering about a hundred and twenty and said brothers the scripture had to be fulfilled which the holy spirit spoke long ago through the mouth of david concerning judas who served as guide for those who arrested jesus he was one of our number and shared in this ministry with the reward he got for his wickedness judas bought a field there he fell headlong his body burst open and all his intestines spilled out everyone in jerusalem heard about this so they called that field in their language akeldama that is field of blood for said peter it is written in the book of psalms may his place be deserted let there be no one to dwell in it and may another take his place of leadership therefore it is necessary to choose one of the men who have been with us the whole time the lord jesus went in and out among us beginning from johns baptism to the time when jesus was taken up from us for one of these must become a witness with us of his resurrection so they proposed two men joseph called barsabbas also known as justus and matthias then they prayed lord you know everyones heart show us which of these two you have chosen to take over this apostolic ministry which judas left to go where he belongs then they cast lots and the lot fell to matthias so he was added to the eleven apostles when the day of pentecost came they were all together in one place suddenly a sound like the blowing of a violent wind came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting they saw what seemed to be tongues of fire that separated and came to rest on each of them all of them were filled with the holy spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the spirit enabled them now there were staying in jerusalem god fearing jews from every nation under heaven when they heard this sound a crowd came together in bewilderment because each one heard them speaking in his own language utterly amazed they asked are not all these men who are speaking galileans then how is it that each of us hears them in his own native language parthians medes and elamites residents of mesopotamia judea and cappadocia pontus and asia phrygia and pamphylia egypt and the parts of libya near cyrene visitors from rome both jews and converts to judaism cretans and arabs we hear them declaring the wonders of god in our own tongues amazed and perplexed they asked one another what does this mean some however made fun of them and said they have had too much wine then peter stood up with the eleven raised his voice and addressed the crowd fellow jews and all of you who live in jerusalem let me explain this to you listen carefully to what i say these men are not drunk as you suppose its only nine in the morning no this is what was spoken by the prophet joel in the last days god says i will pour out my spirit on all people your sons and daughters will prophesy your young men will see visions your old men will dream dreams even on my servants both men and women i will pour out my spirit in those days and they will prophesy i will show wonders in the heaven above and signs on the earth below blood and fire and billows of smoke the sun will be turned to darkness and the moon to blood before the coming of the great and glorious day of the lord and everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved men of israel listen to this jesus of nazareth was a man accredited by god to you by miracles wonders and signs which god did among you through him as you yourselves know this man was handed over to you by gods set purpose and foreknowledge and you with the help of wicked men put him to death by nailing him to the cross but god raised him from the dead freeing him from the agony of death because it was impossible for death to keep its hold on him david said about him i saw the lord always before me because he is at my right hand i will not be shaken therefore my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices my body also will live in hope because you will not abandon me to the grave nor will you let your holy one see decay you have made known to me the paths of life you will fill me with joy in your presence brothers i can tell you confidently that the patriarch david died and was buried and his tomb is here to this day but he was a prophet and knew that god had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne seeing what was ahead he spoke of the resurrection of the christ that he was not abandoned to the grave nor did his body see decay god has raised this jesus to life and we are all witnesses of the fact exalted to the right hand of god he has received from the father the promised holy spirit and has poured out what you now see and hear for david did not ascend to heaven and yet he said the lord said to my lord sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet therefore let all israel be assured of this god has made this jesus whom you crucified both lord and christ when the people heard this they were cut to the heart and said to peter and the other apostles brothers what shall we do peter replied repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the forgiveness of your sins and you will receive the gift of the holy spirit the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off for all whom the lord our god will call with many other words he warned them and he pleaded with them save yourselves from this corrupt generation those who accepted his message were baptized and about three thousand were added to their number that day they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and to the fellowship to the breaking of bread and to prayer everyone was filled with awe and many wonders and miraculous signs were done by the apostles all the believers were together and had everything in common selling their possessions and goods they gave to anyone as he had need every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts they broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts praising god and enjoying the favor of all the people and the lord added to their number daily those who were being saved one day peter and john were going up to the temple at the time of prayer at three in the afternoon now a man crippled from birth was being carried to the temple gate called beautiful where he was put every day to beg from those going into the temple courts when he saw peter and john about to enter he asked them for money peter looked straight at him as did john then peter said look at us so the man gave them his attention expecting to get something from them then peter said silver or gold i do not have but what i have i give you in the name of jesus christ of nazareth walk taking him by the right hand he helped him up and instantly the mans feet and ankles became strong he jumped to his feet and began to walk then he went with them into the temple courts walking and jumping and praising god when all the people saw him walking and praising god they recognized him as the same man who used to sit begging at the temple gate called beautiful and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him while the beggar held on to peter and john all the people were astonished and came running to them in the place called solomons colonnade when peter saw this he said to them men of israel why does this surprise you why do you stare at us as if by our own power or godliness we had made this man walk the god of abraham isaac and jacob the god of our fathers has glorified his servant jesus you handed him over to be killed and you disowned him before pilate though he had decided to let him go you disowned the holy and righteous one and asked that a murderer be released to you you killed the author of life but god raised him from the dead we are witnesses of this by faith in the name of jesus this man whom you see and know was made strong it is jesus name and the faith that comes through him that has given this complete healing to him as you can all see now brothers i know that you acted in ignorance as did your leaders but this is how god fulfilled what he had foretold through all the prophets saying that his christ would suffer repent then and turn to god so that your sins may be wiped out that times of refreshing may come from the lord and that he may send the christ who has been appointed for you even jesus he must remain in heaven until the time comes for god to restore everything as he promised long ago through his holy prophets for moses said the lord your god will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your own people you must listen to everything he tells you anyone who does not listen to him will be completely cut off from among his people indeed all the prophets from samuel on as many as have spoken have foretold these days and you are heirs of the prophets and of the covenant god made with your fathers he said to abraham through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed when god raised up his servant he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways the priests and the captain of the temple guard and the sadducees came up to peter and john while they were speaking to the people they were greatly disturbed because the apostles were teaching the people and proclaiming in jesus the resurrection of the dead they seized peter and john and because it was evening they put them in jail until the next day but many who heard the message believed and the number of men grew to about five thousand the next day the rulers elders and teachers of the law met in jerusalem annas the high priest was there and so were caiaphas john alexander and the other men of the high priests family they had peter and john brought before them and began to question them by what power or what name did you do this then peter filled with the holy spirit said to them rulers and elders of the people if we are being called to account today for an act of kindness shown to a cripple and are asked how he was healed then know this you and all the people of israel it is by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom you crucified but whom god raised from the dead that this man stands before you healed he is the stone you builders rejected which has become the capstone salvation is found in no one else for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved when they saw the courage of peter and john and realized that they were unschooled ordinary men they were astonished and they took note that these men had been with jesus but since they could see the man who had been healed standing there with them there was nothing they could say so they ordered them to withdraw from the sanhedrin and then conferred together what are we going to do with these men they asked everybody living in jerusalem knows they have done an outstanding miracle and we cannot deny it but to stop this thing from spreading any further among the people we must warn these men to speak no longer to anyone in this name then they called them in again and commanded them not to speak or teach at all in the name of jesus but peter and john replied judge for yourselves whether it is right in gods sight to obey you rather than god for we cannot help speaking about what we have seen and heard after further threats they let them go they could not decide how to punish them because all the people were praising god for what had happened for the man who was miraculously healed was over forty years old on their release peter and john went back to their own people and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them when they heard this they raised their voices together in prayer to god sovereign lord they said you made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them you spoke by the holy spirit through the mouth of your servant our father david why do the nations rage and the peoples plot in vain the kings of the earth take their stand and the rulers gather together against the lord and against his anointed one indeed herod and pontius pilate met together with the gentiles and the people of israel in this city to conspire against your holy servant jesus whom you anointed they did what your power and will had decided beforehand should happen now lord consider their threats and enable your servants to speak your word with great boldness stretch out your hand to heal and perform miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant jesus after they prayed the place where they were meeting was shaken and they were all filled with the holy spirit and spoke the word of god boldly all the believers were one in heart and mind no one claimed that any of his possessions was his own but they shared everything they had with great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the lord jesus and much grace was upon them all there were no needy persons among them for from time to time those who owned lands or houses sold them brought the money from the sales and put it at the apostles feet and it was distributed to anyone as he had need joseph a levite from cyprus whom the apostles called barnabas which means son of encouragement sold a field he owned and brought the money and put it at the apostles feet now a man named ananias together with his wife sapphira also sold a piece of property with his wifes full knowledge he kept back part of the money for himself but brought the rest and put it at the apostles feet then peter said ananias how is it that satan has so filled your heart that you have lied to the holy spirit and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land didnt it belong to you before it was sold and after it was sold wasnt the money at your disposal what made you think of doing such a thing you have not lied to men but to god when ananias heard this he fell down and died and great fear seized all who heard what had happened then the young men came forward wrapped up his body and carried him out and buried him about three hours later his wife came in not knowing what had happened peter asked her tell me is this the price you and ananias got for the landyes she said that is the price peter said to her how could you agree to test the spirit of the lord look the feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door and they will carry you out also at that moment she fell down at his feet and died then the young men came in and finding her dead carried her out and buried her beside her husband great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders among the people and all the believers used to meet together in solomons colonnade no one else dared join them even though they were highly regarded by the people nevertheless more and more men and women believed in the lord and were added to their number as a result people brought the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that at least peters shadow might fall on some of them as he passed by crowds gathered also from the towns around jerusalem bringing their sick and those tormented by evil spirits and all of them were healed then the high priest and all his associates who were members of the party of the sadducees were filled with jealousy they arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail but during the night an angel of the lord opened the doors of the jail and brought them out go stand in the temple courts he said and tell the people the full message of this new life at daybreak they entered the temple courts as they had been told and began to teach the people when the high priest and his associates arrived they called together the sanhedrin the full assembly of the elders of israel and sent to the jail for the apostles but on arriving at the jail the officers did not find them there so they went back and reported we found the jail securely locked with the guards standing at the doors but when we opened them we found no one inside on hearing this report the captain of the temple guard and the chief priests were puzzled wondering what would come of this then someone came and said look the men you put in jail are standing in the temple courts teaching the people at that the captain went with his officers and brought the apostles they did not use force because they feared that the people would stone them having brought the apostles they made them appear before the sanhedrin to be questioned by the high priest we gave you strict orders not to teach in this name he said yet you have filled jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this mans blood peter and the other apostles replied we must obey god rather than men the god of our fathers raised jesus from the dead whom you had killed by hanging him on a tree god exalted him to his own right hand as prince and savior that he might give repentance and forgiveness of sins to israel we are witnesses of these things and so is the holy spirit whom god has given to those who obey him when they heard this they were furious and wanted to put them to death but a pharisee named gamaliel a teacher of the law who was honored by all the people stood up in the sanhedrin and ordered that the men be put outside for a little while then he addressed them men of israel consider carefully what you intend to do to these men some time ago theudas appeared claiming to be somebody and about four hundred men rallied to him he was killed all his followers were dispersed and it all came to nothing after him judas the galilean appeared in the days of the census and led a band of people in revolt he too was killed and all his followers were scattered therefore in the present case i advise you leave these men alone let them go for if their purpose or activity is of human origin it will fail but if it is from god you will not be able to stop these men you will only find yourselves fighting against god his speech persuaded them they called the apostles in and had them flogged then they ordered them not to speak in the name of jesus and let them go the apostles left the sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the name day after day in the temple courts and from house to house they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that jesus is the christ in those days when the number of disciples was increasing the grecian jews among them complained against the hebraic jews because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food so the twelve gathered all the disciples together and said it would not be right for us to neglect the ministry of the word of god in order to wait on tables brothers choose seven men from among you who are known to be full of the spirit and wisdom we will turn this responsibility over to them and will give our attention to prayer and the ministry of the word this proposal pleased the whole group they chose stephen a man full of faith and of the holy spirit also philip procorus nicanor timon parmenas and nicolas from antioch a convert to judaism they presented these men to the apostles who prayed and laid their hands on them so the word of god spread the number of disciples in jerusalem increased rapidly and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith now stephen a man full of gods grace and power did great wonders and miraculous signs among the people opposition arose however from members of the synagogue of the freedmen as it was called jews of cyrene and alexandria as well as the provinces of cilicia and asia these men began to argue with stephen but they could not stand up against his wisdom or the spirit by whom he spoke then they secretly persuaded some men to say we have heard stephen speak words of blasphemy against moses and against god so they stirred up the people and the elders and the teachers of the law they seized stephen and brought him before the sanhedrin they produced false witnesses who testified this fellow never stops speaking against this holy place and against the law for we have heard him say that this jesus of nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs moses handed down to us all who were sitting in the sanhedrin looked intently at stephen and they saw that his face was like the face of an angel then the high priest asked him are these charges true to this he replied brothers and fathers listen to me the god of glory appeared to our father abraham while he was still in mesopotamia before he lived in haran leave your country and your people god said and go to the land i will show you so he left the land of the chaldeans and settled in haran after the death of his father god sent him to this land where you are now living he gave him no inheritance here not even a foot of ground but god promised him that he and his descendants after him would possess the land even though at that time abraham had no child god spoke to him in this way your descendants will be strangers in a country not their own and they will be enslaved and mistreated four hundred years but i will punish the nation they serve as slaves god said and afterward they will come out of that country and worship me in this place then he gave abraham the covenant of circumcision and abraham became the father of isaac and circumcised him eight days after his birth later isaac became the father of jacob and jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs because the patriarchs were jealous of joseph they sold him as a slave into egypt but god was with him and rescued him from all his troubles he gave joseph wisdom and enabled him to gain the goodwill of pharaoh king of egypt so he made him ruler over egypt and all his palace then a famine struck all egypt and canaan bringing great suffering and our fathers could not find food when jacob heard that there was grain in egypt he sent our fathers on their first visit on their second visit joseph told his brothers who he was and pharaoh learned about josephs family after this joseph sent for his father jacob and his whole family seventy five in all then jacob went down to egypt where he and our fathers died their bodies were brought back to shechem and placed in the tomb that abraham had bought from the sons of hamor at shechem for a certain sum of money as the time drew near for god to fulfill his promise to abraham the number of our people in egypt greatly increased then another king who knew nothing about joseph became ruler of egypt he dealt treacherously with our people and oppressed our forefathers by forcing them to throw out their newborn babies so that they would die at that time moses was born and he was no ordinary child for three months he was cared for in his fathers house when he was placed outside pharaohs daughter took him and brought him up as her own son moses was educated in all the wisdom of the egyptians and was powerful in speech and action when moses was forty years old he decided to visit his fellow israelites he saw one of them being mistreated by an egyptian so he went to his defense and avenged him by killing the egyptian moses thought that his own people would realize that god was using him to rescue them but they did not the next day moses came upon two israelites who were fighting he tried to reconcile them by saying men you are brothers why do you want to hurt each other but the man who was mistreating the other pushed moses aside and said who made you ruler and judge over us do you want to kill me as you killed the egyptian yesterday when moses heard this he fled to midian where he settled as a foreigner and had two sons after forty years had passed an angel appeared to moses in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near mount sinai when he saw this he was amazed at the sight as he went over to look more closely he heard the lords voice i am the god of your fathers the god of abraham isaac and jacob moses trembled with fear and did not dare to look then the lord said to him take off your sandals the place where you are standing is holy ground i have indeed seen the oppression of my people in egypt i have heard their groaning and have come down to set them free now come i will send you back to egypt this is the same moses whom they had rejected with the words who made you ruler and judge he was sent to be their ruler and deliverer by god himself through the angel who appeared to him in the bush he led them out of egypt and did wonders and miraculous signs in egypt at the red sea and for forty years in the desert this is that moses who told the israelites god will send you a prophet like me from your own people he was in the assembly in the desert with the angel who spoke to him on mount sinai and with our fathers and he received living words to pass on to us but our fathers refused to obey him instead they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to egypt they told aaron make us gods who will go before us as for this fellow moses who led us out of egypt we dont know what has happened to him that was the time they made an idol in the form of a calf they brought sacrifices to it and held a celebration in honor of what their hands had made but god turned away and gave them over to the worship of the heavenly bodies this agrees with what is written in the book of the prophets did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the desert o house of israel you have lifted up the shrine of molech and the star of your god rephan the idols you made to worship therefore i will send you into exile beyond babylon our forefathers had the tabernacle of the testimony with them in the desert it had been made as god directed moses according to the pattern he had seen having received the tabernacle our fathers under joshua brought it with them when they took the land from the nations god drove out before them it remained in the land until the time of david who enjoyed gods favor and asked that he might provide a dwelling place for the god of jacob but it was solomon who built the house for him however the most high does not live in houses made by men as the prophet says heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool what kind of house will you build for me says the lord or where will my resting place be has not my hand made all these things you stiff necked people with uncircumcised hearts and ears you are just like your fathers you always resist the holy spirit was there ever a prophet your fathers did not persecute they even killed those who predicted the coming of the righteous one and now you have betrayed and murdered him you who have received the law that was put into effect through angels but have not obeyed it when they heard this they were furious and gnashed their teeth at him but stephen full of the holy spirit looked up to heaven and saw the glory of god and jesus standing at the right hand of god look he said i see heaven open and the son of man standing at the right hand of god at this they covered their ears and yelling at the top of their voices they all rushed at him dragged him out of the city and began to stone him meanwhile the witnesses laid their clothes at the feet of a young man named saul while they were stoning him stephen prayed lord jesus receive my spirit then he fell on his knees and cried out lord do not hold this sin against them when he had said this he fell asleep and saul was there giving approval to his death on that day a great persecution broke out against the church at jerusalem and all except the apostles were scattered throughout judea and samaria godly men buried stephen and mourned deeply for him but saul began to destroy the church going from house to house he dragged off men and women and put them in prison those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went philip went down to a city in samaria and proclaimed the christ there when the crowds heard philip and saw the miraculous signs he did they all paid close attention to what he said with shrieks evil spirits came out of many and many paralytics and cripples were healed so there was great joy in that city now for some time a man named simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of samaria he boasted that he was someone great and all the people both high and low gave him their attention and exclaimed this man is the divine power known as the great power they followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic but when they believed philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women simon himself believed and was baptized and he followed philip everywhere astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw when the apostles in jerusalem heard that samaria had accepted the word of god they sent peter and john to them when they arrived they prayed for them that they might receive the holy spirit because the holy spirit had not yet come upon any of them they had simply been baptized into the name of the lord jesus then peter and john placed their hands on them and they received the holy spirit when simon saw that the spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles hands he offered them money and said give me also this ability so that everyone on whom i lay my hands may receive the holy spirit peter answered may your money perish with you because you thought you could buy the gift of god with money you have no part or share in this ministry because your heart is not right before god repent of this wickedness and pray to the lord perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart for i see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin then simon answered pray to the lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me when they had testified and proclaimed the word of the lord peter and john returned to jerusalem preaching the gospel in many samaritan villages now an angel of the lord said to philip go south to the road the desert road that goes down from jerusalem to gaza so he started out and on his way he met an ethiopian eunuch an important official in charge of all the treasury of candace queen of the ethiopians this man had gone to jerusalem to worship and on his way home was sitting in his chariot reading the book of isaiah the prophet the spirit told philip go to that chariot and stay near it then philip ran up to the chariot and heard the man reading isaiah the prophet do you understand what you are reading philip asked how can i he said unless someone explains it to me so he invited philip to come up and sit with him the eunuch was reading this passage of scripture he was led like a sheep to the slaughter and as a lamb before the shearer is silent so he did not open his mouth in his humiliation he was deprived of justice who can speak of his descendants for his life was taken from the earth the eunuch asked philip tell me please who is the prophet talking about himself or someone else then philip began with that very passage of scripture and told him the good news about jesus as they traveled along the road they came to some water and the eunuch said look here is water why shouldnt i be baptized see footnote and he gave orders to stop the chariot then both philip and the eunuch went down into the water and philip baptized him when they came up out of the water the spirit of the lord suddenly took philip away and the eunuch did not see him again but went on his way rejoicing philip however appeared at azotus and traveled about preaching the gospel in all the towns until he reached caesarea meanwhile saul was still breathing out murderous threats against the lords disciples he went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues in damascus so that if he found any there who belonged to the way whether men or women he might take them as prisoners to jerusalem as he neared damascus on his journey suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him he fell to the ground and heard a voice say to him saul saul why do you persecute me who are you lord saul asked i am jesus whom you are persecuting he replied now get up and go into the city and you will be told what you must do the men traveling with saul stood there speechless they heard the sound but did not see anyone saul got up from the ground but when he opened his eyes he could see nothing so they led him by the hand into damascus for three days he was blind and did not eat or drink anything in damascus there was a disciple named ananias the lord called to him in a vision ananiasyes lord he answered the lord told him go to the house of judas on straight street and ask for a man from tarsus named saul for he is praying in a vision he has seen a man named ananias come and place his hands on him to restore his sight lord ananias answered i have heard many reports about this man and all the harm he has done to your saints in jerusalem and he has come here with authority from the chief priests to arrest all who call on your name but the lord said to ananias go this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before the gentiles and their kings and before the people of israel i will show him how much he must suffer for my name then ananias went to the house and entered it placing his hands on saul he said brother saul the lord jesus who appeared to you on the road as you were coming here has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the holy spirit immediately something like scales fell from sauls eyes and he could see again he got up and was baptized and after taking some food he regained his strength saul spent several days with the disciples in damascus at once he began to preach in the synagogues that jesus is the son of god all those who heard him were astonished and asked isnt he the man who raised havoc in jerusalem among those who call on this name and hasnt he come here to take them as prisoners to the chief priests yet saul grew more and more powerful and baffled the jews living in damascus by proving that jesus is the christ after many days had gone by the jews conspired to kill him but saul learned of their plan day and night they kept close watch on the city gates in order to kill him but his followers took him by night and lowered him in a basket through an opening in the wall when he came to jerusalem he tried to join the disciples but they were all afraid of him not believing that he really was a disciple but barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles he told them how saul on his journey had seen the lord and that the lord had spoken to him and how in damascus he had preached fearlessly in the name of jesus so saul stayed with them and moved about freely in jerusalem speaking boldly in the name of the lord he talked and debated with the grecian jews but they tried to kill him when the brothers learned of this they took him down to caesarea and sent him off to tarsus then the church throughout judea galilee and samaria enjoyed a time of peace it was strengthened and encouraged by the holy spirit it grew in numbers living in the fear of the lord as peter traveled about the country he went to visit the saints in lydda there he found a man named aeneas a paralytic who had been bedridden for eight years aeneas peter said to him jesus christ heals you get up and take care of your mat immediately aeneas got up all those who lived in lydda and sharon saw him and turned to the lord in joppa there was a disciple named tabitha which when translated is dorcas  who was always doing good and helping the poor about that time she became sick and died and her body was washed and placed in an upstairs room lydda was near joppa so when the disciples heard that peter was in lydda they sent two men to him and urged him please come at once peter went with them and when he arrived he was taken upstairs to the room all the widows stood around him crying and showing him the robes and other clothing that dorcas had made while she was still with them peter sent them all out of the room then he got down on his knees and prayed turning toward the dead woman he said tabitha get up she opened her eyes and seeing peter she sat up he took her by the hand and helped her to her feet then he called the believers and the widows and presented her to them alive this became known all over joppa and many people believed in the lord peter stayed in joppa for some time with a tanner named simon at caesarea there was a man named cornelius a centurion in what was known as the italian regiment he and all his family were devout and god fearing he gave generously to those in need and prayed to god regularly one day at about three in the afternoon he had a vision he distinctly saw an angel of god who came to him and said cornelius cornelius stared at him in fear what is it lord he asked the angel answered your prayers and gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial offering before god now send men to joppa to bring back a man named simon who is called peter he is staying with simon the tanner whose house is by the sea when the angel who spoke to him had gone cornelius called two of his servants and a devout soldier who was one of his attendants he told them everything that had happened and sent them to joppa about noon the following day as they were on their journey and approaching the city peter went up on the roof to pray he became hungry and wanted something to eat and while the meal was being prepared he fell into a trance he saw heaven opened and something like a large sheet being let down to earth by its four corners it contained all kinds of four footed animals as well as reptiles of the earth and birds of the air then a voice told him get up peter kill and eat surely not lord peter replied i have never eaten anything impure or unclean the voice spoke to him a second time do not call anything impure that god has made clean this happened three times and immediately the sheet was taken back to heaven while peter was wondering about the meaning of the vision the men sent by cornelius found out where simons house was and stopped at the gate they called out asking if simon who was known as peter was staying there while peter was still thinking about the vision the spirit said to him simon three men are looking for you so get up and go downstairs do not hesitate to go with them for i have sent them peter went down and said to the men im the one youre looking for why have you come the men replied we have come from cornelius the centurion he is a righteous and god fearing man who is respected by all the jewish people a holy angel told him to have you come to his house so that he could hear what you have to say then peter invited the men into the house to be his guests the next day peter started out with them and some of the brothers from joppa went along the following day he arrived in caesarea cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends as peter entered the house cornelius met him and fell at his feet in reverence but peter made him get up stand up he said i am only a man myself talking with him peter went inside and found a large gathering of people he said to them you are well aware that it is against our law for a jew to associate with a gentile or visit him but god has shown me that i should not call any man impure or unclean so when i was sent for i came without raising any objection may i ask why you sent for me cornelius answered four days ago i was in my house praying at this hour at three in the afternoon suddenly a man in shining clothes stood before me and said cornelius god has heard your prayer and remembered your gifts to the poor send to joppa for simon who is called peter he is a guest in the home of simon the tanner who lives by the sea so i sent for you immediately and it was good of you to come now we are all here in the presence of god to listen to everything the lord has commanded you to tell us then peter began to speak i now realize how true it is that god does not show favoritism but accepts men from every nation who fear him and do what is right you know the message god sent to the people of israel telling the good news of peace through jesus christ who is lord of all you know what has happened throughout judea beginning in galilee after the baptism that john preached how god anointed jesus of nazareth with the holy spirit and power and how he went around doing good and healing all who were under the power of the devil because god was with him we are witnesses of everything he did in the country of the jews and in jerusalem they killed him by hanging him on a tree but god raised him from the dead on the third day and caused him to be seen he was not seen by all the people but by witnesses whom god had already chosen by us who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one whom god appointed as judge of the living and the dead all the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name while peter was still speaking these words the holy spirit came on all who heard the message the circumcised believers who had come with peter were astonished that the gift of the holy spirit had been poured out even on the gentiles for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising god then peter said can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water they have received the holy spirit just as we have so he ordered that they be baptized in the name of jesus christ then they asked peter to stay with them for a few days the apostles and the brothers throughout judea heard that the gentiles also had received the word of god so when peter went up to jerusalem the circumcised believers criticized him and said you went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision i saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners and it came down to where i was i looked into it and saw four footed animals of the earth wild beasts reptiles and birds of the air then i heard a voice telling me get up peter kill and eat i replied surely not lord nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth the voice spoke from heaven a second time do not call anything impure that god has made clean this happened three times and then it was all pulled up to heaven again right then three men who had been sent to me from caesarea stopped at the house where i was staying the spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them these six brothers also went with me and we entered the mans house he told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say send to joppa for simon who is called peter he will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved as i began to speak the holy spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning then i remembered what the lord had said john baptized with water but you will be baptized with the holy spirit so if god gave them the same gift as he gave us who believed in the lord jesus christ who was i to think that i could oppose god when they heard this they had no further objections and praised god saying so then god has granted even the gentiles repentance unto life now those who had been scattered by the persecution in connection with stephen traveled as far as phoenicia cyprus and antioch telling the message only to jews some of them however men from cyprus and cyrene went to antioch and began to speak to greeks also telling them the good news about the lord jesus the lords hand was with them and a great number of people believed and turned to the lord news of this reached the ears of the church at jerusalem and they sent barnabas to antioch when he arrived and saw the evidence of the grace of god he was glad and encouraged them all to remain true to the lord with all their hearts he was a good man full of the holy spirit and faith and a great number of people were brought to the lord then barnabas went to tarsus to look for saul and when he found him he brought him to antioch so for a whole year barnabas and saul met with the church and taught great numbers of people the disciples were called christians first at antioch during this time some prophets came down from jerusalem to antioch one of them named agabus stood up and through the spirit predicted that a severe famine would spread over the entire roman world this happened during the reign of claudius the disciples each according to his ability decided to provide help for the brothers living in judea this they did sending their gift to the elders by barnabas and saul it was about this time that king herod arrested some who belonged to the church intending to persecute them he had james the brother of john put to death with the sword when he saw that this pleased the jews he proceeded to seize peter also this happened during the feast of unleavened bread after arresting him he put him in prison handing him over to be guarded by four squads of four soldiers each herod intended to bring him out for public trial after the passover so peter was kept in prison but the church was earnestly praying to god for him the night before herod was to bring him to trial peter was sleeping between two soldiers bound with two chains and sentries stood guard at the entrance suddenly an angel of the lord appeared and a light shone in the cell he struck peter on the side and woke him up quick get up he said and the chains fell off peters wrists then the angel said to him put on your clothes and sandals and peter did so wrap your cloak around you and follow me the angel told him peter followed him out of the prison but he had no idea that what the angel was doing was really happening he thought he was seeing a vision they passed the first and second guards and came to the iron gate leading to the city it opened for them by itself and they went through it when they had walked the length of one street suddenly the angel left him then peter came to himself and said now i know without a doubt that the lord sent his angel and rescued me from herods clutches and from everything the jewish people were anticipating when this had dawned on him he went to the house of mary the mother of john also called mark where many people had gathered and were praying peter knocked at the outer entrance and a servant girl named rhoda came to answer the door when she recognized peters voice she was so overjoyed she ran back without opening it and exclaimed peter is at the door youre out of your mind they told her when she kept insisting that it was so they said it must be his angel but peter kept on knocking and when they opened the door and saw him they were astonished peter motioned with his hand for them to be quiet and described how the lord had brought him out of prison tell james and the brothers about this he said and then he left for another place in the morning there was no small commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of peter after herod had a thorough search made for him and did not find him he cross examined the guards and ordered that they be executed then herod went from judea to caesarea and stayed there a while he had been quarreling with the people of tyre and sidon they now joined together and sought an audience with him having secured the support of blastus a trusted personal servant of the king they asked for peace because they depended on the kings country for their food supply on the appointed day herod wearing his royal robes sat on his throne and delivered a public address to the people they shouted this is the voice of a god not of a man immediately because herod did not give praise to god an angel of the lord struck him down and he was eaten by worms and died but the word of god continued to increase and spread when barnabas and saul had finished their mission they returned from jerusalem taking with them john also called mark in the church at antioch there were prophets and teachers barnabas simeon called niger lucius of cyrene manaen who had been brought up with herod the tetrarch and saul while they were worshiping the lord and fasting the holy spirit said set apart for me barnabas and saul for the work to which i have called them so after they had fasted and prayed they placed their hands on them and sent them off the two of them sent on their way by the holy spirit went down to seleucia and sailed from there to cyprus when they arrived at salamis they proclaimed the word of god in the jewish synagogues john was with them as their helper they traveled through the whole island until they came to paphos there they met a jewish sorcerer and false prophet named bar jesus who was an attendant of the proconsul sergius paulus the proconsul an intelligent man sent for barnabas and saul because he wanted to hear the word of god but elymas the sorcerer for that is what his name means opposed them and tried to turn the proconsul from the faith then saul who was also called paul filled with the holy spirit looked straight at elymas and said you are a child of the devil and an enemy of everything that is right you are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery will you never stop perverting the right ways of the lord now the hand of the lord is against you you are going to be blind and for a time you will be unable to see the light of the sun immediately mist and darkness came over him and he groped about seeking someone to lead him by the hand when the proconsul saw what had happened he believed for he was amazed at the teaching about the lord from paphos paul and his companions sailed to perga in pamphylia where john left them to return to jerusalem from perga they went on to pisidian antioch on the sabbath they entered the synagogue and sat down after the reading from the law and the prophets the synagogue rulers sent word to them saying brothers if you have a message of encouragement for the people please speak standing up paul motioned with his hand and said men of israel and you gentiles who worship god listen to me the god of the people of israel chose our fathers he made the people prosper during their stay in egypt with mighty power he led them out of that country he endured their conduct for about forty years in the desert he overthrew seven nations in canaan and gave their land to his people as their inheritance all this took about 450 years after this god gave them judges until the time of samuel the prophet then the people asked for a king and he gave them saul son of kish of the tribe of benjamin who ruled forty years after removing saul he made david their king he testified concerning him i have found david son of jesse a man after my own heart he will do everything i want him to do from this mans descendants god has brought to israel the savior jesus as he promised before the coming of jesus john preached repentance and baptism to all the people of israel as john was completing his work he said who do you think i am i am not that one no but he is coming after me whose sandals i am not worthy to untie brothers children of abraham and you god fearing gentiles it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent the people of jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize jesus yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every sabbath though they found no proper ground for a death sentence they asked pilate to have him executed when they had carried out all that was written about him they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb but god raised him from the dead and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from galilee to jerusalem they are now his witnesses to our people we tell you the good news what god promised our fathers he has fulfilled for us their children by raising up jesus as it is written in the second psalm you are my son today i have become your father the fact that god raised him from the dead never to decay is stated in these words i will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to david so it is stated elsewhere you will not let your holy one see decay for when david had served gods purpose in his own generation he fell asleep he was buried with his fathers and his body decayed but the one whom god raised from the dead did not see decay therefore my brothers i want you to know that through jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you through him everyone who believes is justified from everything you could not be justified from by the law of moses take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you look you scoffers wonder and perish for i am going to do something in your days that you would never believe even if someone told you as paul and barnabas were leaving the synagogue the people invited them to speak further about these things on the next sabbath when the congregation was dismissed many of the jews and devout converts to judaism followed paul and barnabas who talked with them and urged them to continue in the grace of god on the next sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the lord when the jews saw the crowds they were filled with jealousy and talked abusively against what paul was saying then paul and barnabas answered them boldly we had to speak the word of god to you first since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life we now turn to the gentiles for this is what the lord has commanded us i have made you a light for the gentiles that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth when the gentiles heard this they were glad and honored the word of the lord and all who were appointed for eternal life believed the word of the lord spread through the whole region but the jews incited the god fearing women of high standing and the leading men of the city they stirred up persecution against paul and barnabas and expelled them from their region so they shook the dust from their feet in protest against them and went to iconium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the holy spirit at iconium paul and barnabas went as usual into the jewish synagogue there they spoke so effectively that a great number of jews and gentiles believed but the jews who refused to believe stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers so paul and barnabas spent considerable time there speaking boldly for the lord who confirmed the message of his grace by enabling them to do miraculous signs and wonders the people of the city were divided some sided with the jews others with the apostles there was a plot afoot among the gentiles and jews together with their leaders to mistreat them and stone them but they found out about it and fled to the lycaonian cities of lystra and derbe and to the surrounding country where they continued to preach the good news in lystra there sat a man crippled in his feet who was lame from birth and had never walked he listened to paul as he was speaking paul looked directly at him saw that he had faith to be healed and called out stand up on your feet at that the man jumped up and began to walk when the crowd saw what paul had done they shouted in the lycaonian language the gods have come down to us in human form barnabas they called zeus and paul they called hermes because he was the chief speaker the priest of zeus whose temple was just outside the city brought bulls and wreaths to the city gates because he and the crowd wanted to offer sacrifices to them but when the apostles barnabas and paul heard of this they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd shouting men why are you doing this we too are only men human like you we are bringing you good news telling you to turn from these worthless things to the living god who made heaven and earth and sea and everything in them in the past he let all nations go their own way yet he has not left himself without testimony he has shown kindness by giving you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons he provides you with plenty of food and fills your hearts with joy even with these words they had difficulty keeping the crowd from sacrificing to them then some jews came from antioch and iconium and won the crowd over they stoned paul and dragged him outside the city thinking he was dead but after the disciples had gathered around him he got up and went back into the city the next day he and barnabas left for derbe they preached the good news in that city and won a large number of disciples then they returned to lystra iconium and antioch strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to remain true to the faith we must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of god they said paul and barnabas appointed elders for them in each church and with prayer and fasting committed them to the lord in whom they had put their trust after going through pisidia they came into pamphylia and when they had preached the word in perga they went down to attalia from attalia they sailed back to antioch where they had been committed to the grace of god for the work they had now completed on arriving there they gathered the church together and reported all that god had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the gentiles and they stayed there a long time with the disciples some men came down from judea to antioch and were teaching the brothers unless you are circumcised according to the custom taught by moses you cannot be saved this brought paul and barnabas into sharp dispute and debate with them so paul and barnabas were appointed along with some other believers to go up to jerusalem to see the apostles and elders about this question the church sent them on their way and as they traveled through phoenicia and samaria they told how the gentiles had been converted this news made all the brothers very glad when they came to jerusalem they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and elders to whom they reported everything god had done through them then some of the believers who belonged to the party of the pharisees stood up and said the gentiles must be circumcised and required to obey the law of moses the apostles and elders met to consider this question after much discussion peter got up and addressed them brothers you know that some time ago god made a choice among you that the gentiles might hear from my lips the message of the gospel and believe god who knows the heart showed that he accepted them by giving the holy spirit to them just as he did to us he made no distinction between us and them for he purified their hearts by faith now then why do you try to test god by putting on the necks of the disciples a yoke that neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear no we believe it is through the grace of our lord jesus that we are saved just as they are the whole assembly became silent as they listened to barnabas and paul telling about the miraculous signs and wonders god had done among the gentiles through them when they finished james spoke up brothers listen to me simon has described to us how god at first showed his concern by taking from the gentiles a people for himself the words of the prophets are in agreement with this as it is written after this i will return and rebuild davids fallen tent its ruins i will rebuild and i will restore it that the remnant of men may seek the lord and all the gentiles who bear my name says the lord who does these things that have been known for ages it is my judgment therefore that we should not make it difficult for the gentiles who are turning to god instead we should write to them telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols from sexual immorality from the meat of strangled animals and from blood for moses has been preached in every city from the earliest times and is read in the synagogues on every sabbath then the apostles and elders with the whole church decided to choose some of their own men and send them to antioch with paul and barnabas they chose judas called barsabbas and silas two men who were leaders among the brothers with them they sent the following letter the apostles and elders your brothers to the gentile believers in antioch syria and cilicia greetings we have heard that some went out from us without our authorization and disturbed you troubling your minds by what they said so we all agreed to choose some men and send them to you with our dear friends barnabas and paul men who have risked their lives for the name of our lord jesus christ therefore we are sending judas and silas to confirm by word of mouth what we are writing it seemed good to the holy spirit and to us not to burden you with anything beyond the following requirements you are to abstain from food sacrificed to idols from blood from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality you will do well to avoid these things farewell the men were sent off and went down to antioch where they gathered the church together and delivered the letter the people read it and were glad for its encouraging message judas and silas who themselves were prophets said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers after spending some time there they were sent off by the brothers with the blessing of peace to return to those who had sent them see footnote but paul and barnabas remained in antioch where they and many others taught and preached the word of the lord some time later paul said to barnabas let us go back and visit the brothers in all the towns where we preached the word of the lord and see how they are doing barnabas wanted to take john also called mark with them but paul did not think it wise to take him because he had deserted them in pamphylia and had not continued with them in the work they had such a sharp disagreement that they parted company barnabas took mark and sailed for cyprus but paul chose silas and left commended by the brothers to the grace of the lord he went through syria and cilicia strengthening the churches he came to derbe and then to lystra where a disciple named timothy lived whose mother was a jewess and a believer but whose father was a greek the brothers at lystra and iconium spoke well of him paul wanted to take him along on the journey so he circumcised him because of the jews who lived in that area for they all knew that his father was a greek as they traveled from town to town they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in jerusalem for the people to obey so the churches were strengthened in the faith and grew daily in numbers paul and his companions traveled throughout the region of phrygia and galatia having been kept by the holy spirit from preaching the word in the province of asia when they came to the border of mysia they tried to enter bithynia but the spirit of jesus would not allow them to so they passed by mysia and went down to troas during the night paul had a vision of a man of macedonia standing and begging him come over to macedonia and help us after paul had seen the vision we got ready at once to leave for macedonia concluding that god had called us to preach the gospel to them from troas we put out to sea and sailed straight for samothrace and the next day on to neapolis from there we traveled to philippi a roman colony and the leading city of that district of macedonia and we stayed there several days on the sabbath we went outside the city gate to the river where we expected to find a place of prayer we sat down and began to speak to the women who had gathered there one of those listening was a woman named lydia a dealer in purple cloth from the city of thyatira who was a worshiper of god the lord opened her heart to respond to pauls message when she and the members of her household were baptized she invited us to her home if you consider me a believer in the lord she said come and stay at my house and she persuaded us once when we were going to the place of prayer we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit by which she predicted the future she earned a great deal of money for her owners by fortune telling this girl followed paul and the rest of us shouting these men are servants of the most high god who are telling you the way to be saved she kept this up for many days finally paul became so troubled that he turned around and said to the spirit in the name of jesus christ i command you to come out of her at that moment the spirit left her when the owners of the slave girl realized that their hope of making money was gone they seized paul and silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities they brought them before the magistrates and said these men are jews and are throwing our city into an uproar by advocating customs unlawful for us romans to accept or practice the crowd joined in the attack against paul and silas and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten after they had been severely flogged they were thrown into prison and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully upon receiving such orders he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks about midnight paul and silas were praying and singing hymns to god and the other prisoners were listening to them suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken at once all the prison doors flew open and everybodys chains came loose the jailer woke up and when he saw the prison doors open he drew his sword and was about to kill himself because he thought the prisoners had escaped but paul shouted dont harm yourself we are all here the jailer called for lights rushed in and fell trembling before paul and silas he then brought them out and asked sirs what must i do to be saved they replied believe in the lord jesus and you will be saved you and your household then they spoke the word of the lord to him and to all the others in his house at that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds then immediately he and all his family were baptized the jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them he was filled with joy because he had come to believe in god he and his whole family when it was daylight the magistrates sent their officers to the jailer with the order release those men the jailer told paul the magistrates have ordered that you and silas be released now you can leave go in peace but paul said to the officers they beat us publicly without a trial even though we are roman citizens and threw us into prison and now do they want to get rid of us quietly no let them come themselves and escort us out the officers reported this to the magistrates and when they heard that paul and silas were roman citizens they were alarmed they came to appease them and escorted them from the prison requesting them to leave the city after paul and silas came out of the prison they went to lydias house where they met with the brothers and encouraged them then they left when they had passed through amphipolis and apollonia they came to thessalonica where there was a jewish synagogue as his custom was paul went into the synagogue and on three sabbath days he reasoned with them from the scriptures explaining and proving that the christ had to suffer and rise from the dead this jesus i am proclaiming to you is the christ he said some of the jews were persuaded and joined paul and silas as did a large number of god fearing greeks and not a few prominent women but the jews were jealous so they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace formed a mob and started a riot in the city they rushed to jasons house in search of paul and silas in order to bring them out to the crowd but when they did not find them they dragged jason and some other brothers before the city officials shouting these men who have caused trouble all over the world have now come here and jason has welcomed them into his house they are all defying caesars decrees saying that there is another king one called jesus when they heard this the crowd and the city officials were thrown into turmoil then they made jason and the others post bond and let them go as soon as it was night the brothers sent paul and silas away to berea on arriving there they went to the jewish synagogue now the bereans were of more noble character than the thessalonians for they received the message with great eagerness and examined the scriptures every day to see if what paul said was true many of the jews believed as did also a number of prominent greek women and many greek men when the jews in thessalonica learned that paul was preaching the word of god at berea they went there too agitating the crowds and stirring them up the brothers immediately sent paul to the coast but silas and timothy stayed at berea the men who escorted paul brought him to athens and then left with instructions for silas and timothy to join him as soon as possible while paul was waiting for them in athens he was greatly distressed to see that the city was full of idols so he reasoned in the synagogue with the jews and the god fearing greeks as well as in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there a group of epicurean and stoic philosophers began to dispute with him some of them asked what is this babbler trying to say others remarked he seems to be advocating foreign gods they said this because paul was preaching the good news about jesus and the resurrection then they took him and brought him to a meeting of the areopagus where they said to him may we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting you are bringing some strange ideas to our ears and we want to know what they mean all the athenians and the foreigners who lived there spent their time doing nothing but talking about and listening to the latest ideas paul then stood up in the meeting of the areopagus and said men of athens i see that in every way you are very religious for as i walked around and looked carefully at your objects of worship i even found an altar with this inscription|sc to an unknown god now what you worship as something unknown i am going to proclaim to you the god who made the world and everything in it is the lord of heaven and earth and does not live in temples built by hands and he is not served by human hands as if he needed anything because he himself gives all men life and breath and everything else from one man he made every nation of men that they should inhabit the whole earth and he determined the times set for them and the exact places where they should live god did this so that men would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him though he is not far from each one of us for in him we live and move and have our being as some of your own poets have said we are his offspring therefore since we are gods offspring we should not think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone an image made by mans design and skill in the past god overlooked such ignorance but now he commands all people everywhere to repent for he has set a day when he will judge the world with justice by the man he has appointed he has given proof of this to all men by raising him from the dead when they heard about the resurrection of the dead some of them sneered but others said we want to hear you again on this subject at that paul left the council a few men became followers of paul and believed among them was dionysius a member of the areopagus also a woman named damaris and a number of others after this paul left athens and went to corinth there he met a jew named aquila a native of pontus who had recently come from italy with his wife priscilla because claudius had ordered all the jews to leave rome paul went to see them and because he was a tentmaker as they were he stayed and worked with them every sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue trying to persuade jews and greeks when silas and timothy came from macedonia paul devoted himself exclusively to preaching testifying to the jews that jesus was the christ but when the jews opposed paul and became abusive he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them your blood be on your own heads i am clear of my responsibility from now on i will go to the gentiles then paul left the synagogue and went next door to the house of titius justus a worshiper of god crispus the synagogue ruler and his entire household believed in the lord and many of the corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized one night the lord spoke to paul in a vision do not be afraid keep on speaking do not be silent for i am with you and no one is going to attack and harm you because i have many people in this city so paul stayed for a year and a half teaching them the word of god while gallio was proconsul of achaia the jews made a united attack on paul and brought him into court this man they charged is persuading the people to worship god in ways contrary to the law just as paul was about to speak gallio said to the jews if you jews were making a complaint about some misdemeanor or serious crime it would be reasonable for me to listen to you but since it involves questions about words and names and your own law settle the matter yourselves i will not be a judge of such things so he had them ejected from the court then they all turned on sosthenes the synagogue ruler and beat him in front of the court but gallio showed no concern whatever paul stayed on in corinth for some time then he left the brothers and sailed for syria accompanied by priscilla and aquila before he sailed he had his hair cut off at cenchrea because of a vow he had taken they arrived at ephesus where paul left priscilla and aquila he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the jews when they asked him to spend more time with them he declined but as he left he promised i will come back if it is gods will then he set sail from ephesus when he landed at caesarea he went up and greeted the church and then went down to antioch after spending some time in antioch paul set out from there and traveled from place to place throughout the region of galatia and phrygia strengthening all the disciples meanwhile a jew named apollos a native of alexandria came to ephesus he was a learned man with a thorough knowledge of the scriptures he had been instructed in the way of the lord and he spoke with great fervor and taught about jesus accurately though he knew only the baptism of john he began to speak boldly in the synagogue when priscilla and aquila heard him they invited him to their home and explained to him the way of god more adequately when apollos wanted to go to achaia the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples there to welcome him on arriving he was a great help to those who by grace had believed for he vigorously refuted the jews in public debate proving from the scriptures that jesus was the christ while apollos was at corinth paul took the road through the interior and arrived at ephesus there he found some disciples and asked them did you receive the holy spirit when you believed they answered no we have not even heard that there is a holy spirit so paul asked then what baptism did you receivejohns baptism they replied paul said johns baptism was a baptism of repentance he told the people to believe in the one coming after him that is in jesus on hearing this they were baptized into the name of the lord jesus when paul placed his hands on them the holy spirit came on them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied there were about twelve men in all paul entered the synagogue and spoke boldly there for three months arguing persuasively about the kingdom of god but some of them became obstinate they refused to believe and publicly maligned the way so paul left them he took the disciples with him and had discussions daily in the lecture hall of tyrannus this went on for two years so that all the jews and greeks who lived in the province of asia heard the word of the lord god did extraordinary miracles through paul so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them some jews who went around driving out evil spirits tried to invoke the name of the lord jesus over those who were demon possessed they would say in the name of jesus whom paul preaches i command you to come out seven sons of sceva a jewish chief priest were doing this one day the evil spirit answered them jesus i know and i know about paul but who are you then the man who had the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered them all he gave them such a beating that they ran out of the house naked and bleeding when this became known to the jews and greeks living in ephesus they were all seized with fear and the name of the lord jesus was held in high honor many of those who believed now came and openly confessed their evil deeds a number who had practiced sorcery brought their scrolls together and burned them publicly when they calculated the value of the scrolls the total came to fifty thousand drachmas in this way the word of the lord spread widely and grew in power after all this had happened paul decided to go to jerusalem passing through macedonia and achaia after i have been there he said i must visit rome also he sent two of his helpers timothy and erastus to macedonia while he stayed in the province of asia a little longer about that time there arose a great disturbance about the way a silversmith named demetrius who made silver shrines of artemis brought in no little business for the craftsmen he called them together along with the workmen in related trades and said men you know we receive a good income from this business and you see and hear how this fellow paul has convinced and led astray large numbers of people here in ephesus and in practically the whole province of asia he says that man made gods are no gods at all there is danger not only that our trade will lose its good name but also that the temple of the great goddess artemis will be discredited and the goddess herself who is worshiped throughout the province of asia and the world will be robbed of her divine majesty when they heard this they were furious and began shouting great is artemis of the ephesians soon the whole city was in an uproar the people seized gaius and aristarchus pauls traveling companions from macedonia and rushed as one man into the theater paul wanted to appear before the crowd but the disciples would not let him even some of the officials of the province friends of paul sent him a message begging him not to venture into the theater the assembly was in confusion some were shouting one thing some another most of the people did not even know why they were there the jews pushed alexander to the front and some of the crowd shouted instructions to him he motioned for silence in order to make a defense before the people but when they realized he was a jew they all shouted in unison for about two hours great is artemis of the ephesians the city clerk quieted the crowd and said men of ephesus doesnt all the world know that the city of ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great artemis and of her image which fell from heaven therefore since these facts are undeniable you ought to be quiet and not do anything rash you have brought these men here though they have neither robbed temples nor blasphemed our goddess if then demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a grievance against anybody the courts are open and there are proconsuls they can press charges if there is anything further you want to bring up it must be settled in a legal assembly as it is we are in danger of being charged with rioting because of todays events in that case we would not be able to account for this commotion since there is no reason for it after he had said this he dismissed the assembly when the uproar had ended paul sent for the disciples and after encouraging them said good by and set out for macedonia he traveled through that area speaking many words of encouragement to the people and finally arrived in greece where he stayed three months because the jews made a plot against him just as he was about to sail for syria he decided to go back through macedonia he was accompanied by sopater son of pyrrhus from berea aristarchus and secundus from thessalonica gaius from derbe timothy also and tychicus and trophimus from the province of asia these men went on ahead and waited for us at troas but we sailed from philippi after the feast of unleavened bread and five days later joined the others at troas where we stayed seven days on the first day of the week we came together to break bread paul spoke to the people and because he intended to leave the next day kept on talking until midnight there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting seated in a window was a young man named eutychus who was sinking into a deep sleep as paul talked on and on when he was sound asleep he fell to the ground from the third story and was picked up dead paul went down threw himself on the young man and put his arms around him dont be alarmed he said hes alive then he went upstairs again and broke bread and ate after talking until daylight he left the people took the young man home alive and were greatly comforted we went on ahead to the ship and sailed for assos where we were going to take paul aboard he had made this arrangement because he was going there on foot when he met us at assos we took him aboard and went on to mitylene the next day we set sail from there and arrived off kios the day after that we crossed over to samos and on the following day arrived at miletus paul had decided to sail past ephesus to avoid spending time in the province of asia for he was in a hurry to reach jerusalem if possible by the day of pentecost from miletus paul sent to ephesus for the elders of the church when they arrived he said to them you know how i lived the whole time i was with you from the first day i came into the province of asia i served the lord with great humility and with tears although i was severely tested by the plots of the jews you know that i have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house i have declared to both jews and greeks that they must turn to god in repentance and have faith in our lord jesus and now compelled by the spirit i am going to jerusalem not knowing what will happen to me there i only know that in every city the holy spirit warns me that prison and hardships are facing me however i consider my life worth nothing to me if only i may finish the race and complete the task the lord jesus has given me the task of testifying to the gospel of gods grace now i know that none of you among whom i have gone about preaching the kingdom will ever see me again therefore i declare to you today that i am innocent of the blood of all men for i have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of god keep watch over yourselves and all the flock of which the holy spirit has made you overseers be shepherds of the church of god which he bought with his own blood i know that after i leave savage wolves will come in among you and will not spare the flock even from your own number men will arise and distort the truth in order to draw away disciples after them so be on your guard remember that for three years i never stopped warning each of you night and day with tears now i commit you to god and to the word of his grace which can build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified i have not coveted anyones silver or gold or clothing you yourselves know that these hands of mine have supplied my own needs and the needs of my companions in everything i did i showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak remembering the words the lord jesus himself said it is more blessed to give than to receive when he had said this he knelt down with all of them and prayed they all wept as they embraced him and kissed him what grieved them most was his statement that they would never see his face again then they accompanied him to the ship after we had torn ourselves away from them we put out to sea and sailed straight to cos the next day we went to rhodes and from there to patara we found a ship crossing over to phoenicia went on board and set sail after sighting cyprus and passing to the south of it we sailed on to syria we landed at tyre where our ship was to unload its cargo finding the disciples there we stayed with them seven days through the spirit they urged paul not to go on to jerusalem but when our time was up we left and continued on our way all the disciples and their wives and children accompanied us out of the city and there on the beach we knelt to pray after saying good by to each other we went aboard the ship and they returned home we continued our voyage from tyre and landed at ptolemais where we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for a day leaving the next day we reached caesarea and stayed at the house of philip the evangelist one of the seven he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied after we had been there a number of days a prophet named agabus came down from judea coming over to us he took pauls belt tied his own hands and feet with it and said the holy spirit says in this way the jews of jerusalem will bind the owner of this belt and will hand him over to the gentiles when we heard this we and the people there pleaded with paul not to go up to jerusalem then paul answered why are you weeping and breaking my heart i am ready not only to be bound but also to die in jerusalem for the name of the lord jesus when he would not be dissuaded we gave up and said the lords will be done after this we got ready and went up to jerusalem some of the disciples from caesarea accompanied us and brought us to the home of mnason where we were to stay he was a man from cyprus and one of the early disciples when we arrived at jerusalem the brothers received us warmly the next day paul and the rest of us went to see james and all the elders were present paul greeted them and reported in detail what god had done among the gentiles through his ministry when they heard this they praised god then they said to paul you see brother how many thousands of jews have believed and all of them are zealous for the law they have been informed that you teach all the jews who live among the gentiles to turn away from moses telling them not to circumcise their children or live according to our customs what shall we do they will certainly hear that you have come so do what we tell you there are four men with us who have made a vow take these men join in their purification rites and pay their expenses so that they can have their heads shaved then everybody will know there is no truth in these reports about you but that you yourself are living in obedience to the law as for the gentile believers we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols from blood from the meat of strangled animals and from sexual immorality the next day paul took the men and purified himself along with them then he went to the temple to give notice of the date when the days of purification would end and the offering would be made for each of them when the seven days were nearly over some jews from the province of asia saw paul at the temple they stirred up the whole crowd and seized him shouting men of israel help us this is the man who teaches all men everywhere against our people and our law and this place and besides he has brought greeks into the temple area and defiled this holy place they had previously seen trophimus the ephesian in the city with paul and assumed that paul had brought him into the temple area the whole city was aroused and the people came running from all directions seizing paul they dragged him from the temple and immediately the gates were shut while they were trying to kill him news reached the commander of the roman troops that the whole city of jerusalem was in an uproar he at once took some officers and soldiers and ran down to the crowd when the rioters saw the commander and his soldiers they stopped beating paul the commander came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains then he asked who he was and what he had done some in the crowd shouted one thing and some another and since the commander could not get at the truth because of the uproar he ordered that paul be taken into the barracks when paul reached the steps the violence of the mob was so great he had to be carried by the soldiers the crowd that followed kept shouting away with him as the soldiers were about to take paul into the barracks he asked the commander may i say something to you do you speak greek he replied arent you the egyptian who started a revolt and led four thousand terrorists out into the desert some time ago paul answered i am a jew from tarsus in cilicia a citizen of no ordinary city please let me speak to the people having received the commanders permission paul stood on the steps and motioned to the crowd when they were all silent he said to them in aramaic brothers and fathers listen now to my defense when they heard him speak to them in aramaic they became very quiet then paul said i am a jew born in tarsus of cilicia but brought up in this city under gamaliel i was thoroughly trained in the law of our fathers and was just as zealous for god as any of you are today i persecuted the followers of this way to their death arresting both men and women and throwing them into prison as also the high priest and all the council can testify i even obtained letters from them to their brothers in damascus and went there to bring these people as prisoners to jerusalem to be punished about noon as i came near damascus suddenly a bright light from heaven flashed around me i fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me saul saul why do you persecute me who are you lord i asked i am jesus of nazareth whom you are persecuting he replied my companions saw the light but they did not understand the voice of him who was speaking to me what shall i do lord i asked get up the lord said and go into damascus there you will be told all that you have been assigned to do my companions led me by the hand into damascus because the brilliance of the light had blinded me a man named ananias came to see me he was a devout observer of the law and highly respected by all the jews living there he stood beside me and said brother saul receive your sight and at that very moment i was able to see him then he said the god of our fathers has chosen you to know his will and to see the righteous one and to hear words from his mouth you will be his witness to all men of what you have seen and heard and now what are you waiting for get up be baptized and wash your sins away calling on his name when i returned to jerusalem and was praying at the temple i fell into a trance and saw the lord speaking quick he said to me leave jerusalem immediately because they will not accept your testimony about me lord i replied these men know that i went from one synagogue to another to imprison and beat those who believe in you and when the blood of your martyr stephen was shed i stood there giving my approval and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him then the lord said to me go i will send you far away to the gentiles the crowd listened to paul until he said this then they raised their voices and shouted rid the earth of him hes not fit to live as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air the commander ordered paul to be taken into the barracks he directed that he be flogged and questioned in order to find out why the people were shouting at him like this as they stretched him out to flog him paul said to the centurion standing there is it legal for you to flog a roman citizen who hasnt even been found guilty when the centurion heard this he went to the commander and reported it what are you going to do he asked this man is a roman citizen the commander went to paul and asked tell me are you a roman citizenyes i am he answered then the commander said i had to pay a big price for my citizenshipbut i was born a citizen paul replied those who were about to question him withdrew immediately the commander himself was alarmed when he realized that he had put paul a roman citizen in chains the next day since the commander wanted to find out exactly why paul was being accused by the jews he released him and ordered the chief priests and all the sanhedrin to assemble then he brought paul and had him stand before them paul looked straight at the sanhedrin and said my brothers i have fulfilled my duty to god in all good conscience to this day at this the high priest ananias ordered those standing near paul to strike him on the mouth then paul said to him god will strike you you whitewashed wall you sit there to judge me according to the law yet you yourself violate the law by commanding that i be struck those who were standing near paul said you dare to insult gods high priest paul replied brothers i did not realize that he was the high priest for it is written do not speak evil about the ruler of your people then paul knowing that some of them were sadducees and the others pharisees called out in the sanhedrin my brothers i am a pharisee the son of a pharisee i stand on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead when he said this a dispute broke out between the pharisees and the sadducees and the assembly was divided the sadducees say that there is no resurrection and that there are neither angels nor spirits but the pharisees acknowledge them all there was a great uproar and some of the teachers of the law who were pharisees stood up and argued vigorously we find nothing wrong with this man they said what if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him the dispute became so violent that the commander was afraid paul would be torn to pieces by them he ordered the troops to go down and take him away from them by force and bring him into the barracks the following night the lord stood near paul and said take courage as you have testified about me in jerusalem so you must also testify in rome the next morning the jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed paul more than forty men were involved in this plot they went to the chief priests and elders and said we have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed paul now then you and the sanhedrin petition the commander to bring him before you on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about his case we are ready to kill him before he gets here but when the son of pauls sister heard of this plot he went into the barracks and told paul then paul called one of the centurions and said take this young man to the commander he has something to tell him so he took him to the commander the centurion said paul the prisoner sent for me and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you the commander took the young man by the hand drew him aside and asked what is it you want to tell me he said the jews have agreed to ask you to bring paul before the sanhedrin tomorrow on the pretext of wanting more accurate information about him dont give in to them because more than forty of them are waiting in ambush for him they have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him they are ready now waiting for your consent to their request the commander dismissed the young man and cautioned him dont tell anyone that you have reported this to me then he called two of his centurions and ordered them get ready a detachment of two hundred soldiers seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go to caesarea at nine tonight provide mounts for paul so that he may be taken safely to governor felix he wrote a letter as follows claudius lysias to his excellency governor felix greetings this man was seized by the jews and they were about to kill him but i came with my troops and rescued him for i had learned that he is a roman citizen i wanted to know why they were accusing him so i brought him to their sanhedrin i found that the accusation had to do with questions about their law but there was no charge against him that deserved death or imprisonment when i was informed of a plot to be carried out against the man i sent him to you at once i also ordered his accusers to present to you their case against him so the soldiers carrying out their orders took paul with them during the night and brought him as far as antipatris the next day they let the cavalry go on with him while they returned to the barracks when the cavalry arrived in caesarea they delivered the letter to the governor and handed paul over to him the governor read the letter and asked what province he was from learning that he was from cilicia he said i will hear your case when your accusers get here then he ordered that paul be kept under guard in herods palace five days later the high priest ananias went down to caesarea with some of the elders and a lawyer named tertullus and they brought their charges against paul before the governor when paul was called in tertullus presented his case before felix we have enjoyed a long period of peace under you and your foresight has brought about reforms in this nation everywhere and in every way most excellent felix we acknowledge this with profound gratitude but in order not to weary you further i would request that you be kind enough to hear us briefly we have found this man to be a troublemaker stirring up riots among the jews all over the world he is a ringleader of the nazarene sect and even tried to desecrate the temple so we seized him see footnote by examining him yourself you will be able to learn the truth about all these charges we are bringing against him the jews joined in the accusation asserting that these things were true when the governor motioned for him to speak paul replied i know that for a number of years you have been a judge over this nation so i gladly make my defense you can easily verify that no more than twelve days ago i went up to jerusalem to worship my accusers did not find me arguing with anyone at the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or anywhere else in the city and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now making against me however i admit that i worship the god of our fathers as a follower of the way which they call a sect i believe everything that agrees with the law and that is written in the prophets and i have the same hope in god as these men that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked so i strive always to keep my conscience clear before god and man after an absence of several years i came to jerusalem to bring my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings i was ceremonially clean when they found me in the temple courts doing this there was no crowd with me nor was i involved in any disturbance but there are some jews from the province of asia who ought to be here before you and bring charges if they have anything against me or these who are here should state what crime they found in me when i stood before the sanhedrin unless it was this one thing i shouted as i stood in their presence it is concerning the resurrection of the dead that i am on trial before you today then felix who was well acquainted with the way adjourned the proceedings when lysias the commander comes he said i will decide your case he ordered the centurion to keep paul under guard but to give him some freedom and permit his friends to take care of his needs several days later felix came with his wife drusilla who was a jewess he sent for paul and listened to him as he spoke about faith in christ jesus as paul discoursed on righteousness self control and the judgment to come felix was afraid and said thats enough for now you may leave when i find it convenient i will send for you at the same time he was hoping that paul would offer him a bribe so he sent for him frequently and talked with him when two years had passed felix was succeeded by porcius festus but because felix wanted to grant a favor to the jews he left paul in prison three days after arriving in the province festus went up from caesarea to jerusalem where the chief priests and jewish leaders appeared before him and presented the charges against paul they urgently requested festus as a favor to them to have paul transferred to jerusalem for they were preparing an ambush to kill him along the way festus answered paul is being held at caesarea and i myself am going there soon let some of your leaders come with me and press charges against the man there if he has done anything wrong after spending eight or ten days with them he went down to caesarea and the next day he convened the court and ordered that paul be brought before him when paul appeared the jews who had come down from jerusalem stood around him bringing many serious charges against him which they could not prove then paul made his defense i have done nothing wrong against the law of the jews or against the temple or against caesar festus wishing to do the jews a favor said to paul are you willing to go up to jerusalem and stand trial before me there on these charges paul answered i am now standing before caesars court where i ought to be tried i have not done any wrong to the jews as you yourself know very well if however i am guilty of doing anything deserving death i do not refuse to die but if the charges brought against me by these jews are not true no one has the right to hand me over to them i appeal to caesar after festus had conferred with his council he declared you have appealed to caesar to caesar you will go a few days later king agrippa and bernice arrived at caesarea to pay their respects to festus since they were spending many days there festus discussed pauls case with the king he said there is a man here whom felix left as a prisoner when i went to jerusalem the chief priests and elders of the jews brought charges against him and asked that he be condemned i told them that it is not the roman custom to hand over any man before he has faced his accusers and has had an opportunity to defend himself against their charges when they came here with me i did not delay the case but convened the court the next day and ordered the man to be brought in when his accusers got up to speak they did not charge him with any of the crimes i had expected instead they had some points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a dead man named jesus who paul claimed was alive i was at a loss how to investigate such matters so i asked if he would be willing to go to jerusalem and stand trial there on these charges when paul made his appeal to be held over for the emperors decision i ordered him held until i could send him to caesar then agrippa said to festus i would like to hear this man myself he replied tomorrow you will hear him the next day agrippa and bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience room with the high ranking officers and the leading men of the city at the command of festus paul was brought in festus said king agrippa and all who are present with us you see this man the whole jewish community has petitioned me about him in jerusalem and here in caesarea shouting that he ought not to live any longer i found he had done nothing deserving of death but because he made his appeal to the emperor i decided to send him to rome but i have nothing definite to write to his majesty about him therefore i have brought him before all of you and especially before you king agrippa so that as a result of this investigation i may have something to write for i think it is unreasonable to send on a prisoner without specifying the charges against him then agrippa said to paul you have permission to speak for yourself so paul motioned with his hand and began his defense king agrippa i consider myself fortunate to stand before you today as i make my defense against all the accusations of the jews and especially so because you are well acquainted with all the jewish customs and controversies therefore i beg you to listen to me patiently the jews all know the way i have lived ever since i was a child from the beginning of my life in my own country and also in jerusalem they have known me for a long time and can testify if they are willing that according to the strictest sect of our religion i lived as a pharisee and now it is because of my hope in what god has promised our fathers that i am on trial today this is the promise our twelve tribes are hoping to see fulfilled as they earnestly serve god day and night o king it is because of this hope that the jews are accusing me why should any of you consider it incredible that god raises the dead i too was convinced that i ought to do all that was possible to oppose the name of jesus of nazareth and that is just what i did in jerusalem on the authority of the chief priests i put many of the saints in prison and when they were put to death i cast my vote against them many a time i went from one synagogue to another to have them punished and i tried to force them to blaspheme in my obsession against them i even went to foreign cities to persecute them on one of these journeys i was going to damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests about noon o king as i was on the road i saw a light from heaven brighter than the sun blazing around me and my companions we all fell to the ground and i heard a voice saying to me in aramaic saul saul why do you persecute me it is hard for you to kick against the goads then i asked who are you lord i am jesus whom you are persecuting the lord replied now get up and stand on your feet i have appeared to you to appoint you as a servant and as a witness of what you have seen of me and what i will show you i will rescue you from your own people and from the gentiles i am sending you to them to open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from the power of satan to god so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me so then king agrippa i was not disobedient to the vision from heaven first to those in damascus then to those in jerusalem and in all judea and to the gentiles also i preached that they should repent and turn to god and prove their repentance by their deeds that is why the jews seized me in the temple courts and tried to kill me but i have had gods help to this very day and so i stand here and testify to small and great alike i am saying nothing beyond what the prophets and moses said would happen that the christ would suffer and as the first to rise from the dead would proclaim light to his own people and to the gentiles at this point festus interrupted pauls defense you are out of your mind paul he shouted your great learning is driving you insane i am not insane most excellent festus paul replied what i am saying is true and reasonable the king is familiar with these things and i can speak freely to him i am convinced that none of this has escaped his notice because it was not done in a corner king agrippa do you believe the prophets i know you do then agrippa said to paul do you think that in such a short time you can persuade me to be a christian paul replied short time or long i pray god that not only you but all who are listening to me today may become what i am except for these chains the king rose and with him the governor and bernice and those sitting with them they left the room and while talking with one another they said this man is not doing anything that deserves death or imprisonment agrippa said to festus this man could have been set free if he had not appealed to caesar when it was decided that we would sail for italy paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion named julius who belonged to the imperial regiment we boarded a ship from adramyttium about to sail for ports along the coast of the province of asia and we put out to sea aristarchus a macedonian from thessalonica was with us the next day we landed at sidon and julius in kindness to paul allowed him to go to his friends so they might provide for his needs from there we put out to sea again and passed to the lee of cyprus because the winds were against us when we had sailed across the open sea off the coast of cilicia and pamphylia we landed at myra in lycia there the centurion found an alexandrian ship sailing for italy and put us on board we made slow headway for many days and had difficulty arriving off cnidus when the wind did not allow us to hold our course we sailed to the lee of crete opposite salmone we moved along the coast with difficulty and came to a place called fair havens near the town of lasea much time had been lost and sailing had already become dangerous because by now it was after the fast so paul warned them men i can see that our voyage is going to be disastrous and bring great loss to ship and cargo and to our own lives also but the centurion instead of listening to what paul said followed the advice of the pilot and of the owner of the ship since the harbor was unsuitable to winter in the majority decided that we should sail on hoping to reach phoenix and winter there this was a harbor in crete facing both southwest and northwest when a gentle south wind began to blow they thought they had obtained what they wanted so they weighed anchor and sailed along the shore of crete before very long a wind of hurricane force called the northeaster swept down from the island the ship was caught by the storm and could not head into the wind so we gave way to it and were driven along as we passed to the lee of a small island called cauda we were hardly able to make the lifeboat secure when the men had hoisted it aboard they passed ropes under the ship itself to hold it together fearing that they would run aground on the sandbars of syrtis they lowered the sea anchor and let the ship be driven along we took such a violent battering from the storm that the next day they began to throw the cargo overboard on the third day they threw the ships tackle overboard with their own hands when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and the storm continued raging we finally gave up all hope of being saved after the men had gone a long time without food paul stood up before them and said men you should have taken my advice not to sail from crete then you would have spared yourselves this damage and loss but now i urge you to keep up your courage because not one of you will be lost only the ship will be destroyed last night an angel of the god whose i am and whom i serve stood beside me and said do not be afraid paul you must stand trial before caesar and god has graciously given you the lives of all who sail with you so keep up your courage men for i have faith in god that it will happen just as he told me nevertheless we must run aground on some island on the fourteenth night we were still being driven across the adriatic sea when about midnight the sailors sensed they were approaching land they took soundings and found that the water was a hundred and twenty feet deep a short time later they took soundings again and found it was ninety feet deep fearing that we would be dashed against the rocks they dropped four anchors from the stern and prayed for daylight in an attempt to escape from the ship the sailors let the lifeboat down into the sea pretending they were going to lower some anchors from the bow then paul said to the centurion and the soldiers unless these men stay with the ship you cannot be saved so the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and let it fall away just before dawn paul urged them all to eat for the last fourteen days he said you have been in constant suspense and have gone without food you havent eaten anything now i urge you to take some food you need it to survive not one of you will lose a single hair from his head after he said this he took some bread and gave thanks to god in front of them all then he broke it and began to eat they were all encouraged and ate some food themselves altogether there were 276 of us on board when they had eaten as much as they wanted they lightened the ship by throwing the grain into the sea when daylight came they did not recognize the land but they saw a bay with a sandy beach where they decided to run the ship aground if they could cutting loose the anchors they left them in the sea and at the same time untied the ropes that held the rudders then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and made for the beach but the ship struck a sandbar and ran aground the bow stuck fast and would not move and the stern was broken to pieces by the pounding of the surf the soldiers planned to kill the prisoners to prevent any of them from swimming away and escaping but the centurion wanted to spare pauls life and kept them from carrying out their plan he ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land the rest were to get there on planks or on pieces of the ship in this way everyone reached land in safety once safely on shore we found out that the island was called malta the islanders showed us unusual kindness they built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold paul gathered a pile of brushwood and as he put it on the fire a viper driven out by the heat fastened itself on his hand when the islanders saw the snake hanging from his hand they said to each other this man must be a murderer for though he escaped from the sea justice has not allowed him to live but paul shook the snake off into the fire and suffered no ill effects the people expected him to swell up or suddenly fall dead but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him they changed their minds and said he was a god there was an estate nearby that belonged to publius the chief official of the island he welcomed us to his home and for three days entertained us hospitably his father was sick in bed suffering from fever and dysentery paul went in to see him and after prayer placed his hands on him and healed him when this had happened the rest of the sick on the island came and were cured they honored us in many ways and when we were ready to sail they furnished us with the supplies we needed after three months we put out to sea in a ship that had wintered in the island it was an alexandrian ship with the figurehead of the twin gods castor and pollux we put in at syracuse and stayed there three days from there we set sail and arrived at rhegium the next day the south wind came up and on the following day we reached puteoli there we found some brothers who invited us to spend a week with them and so we came to rome the brothers there had heard that we were coming and they traveled as far as the forum of appius and the three taverns to meet us at the sight of these men paul thanked god and was encouraged when we got to rome paul was allowed to live by himself with a soldier to guard him three days later he called together the leaders of the jews when they had assembled paul said to them my brothers although i have done nothing against our people or against the customs of our ancestors i was arrested in jerusalem and handed over to the romans they examined me and wanted to release me because i was not guilty of any crime deserving death but when the jews objected i was compelled to appeal to caesar not that i had any charge to bring against my own people for this reason i have asked to see you and talk with you it is because of the hope of israel that i am bound with this chain they replied we have not received any letters from judea concerning you and none of the brothers who have come from there has reported or said anything bad about you but we want to hear what your views are for we know that people everywhere are talking against this sect they arranged to meet paul on a certain day and came in even larger numbers to the place where he was staying from morning till evening he explained and declared to them the kingdom of god and tried to convince them about jesus from the law of moses and from the prophets some were convinced by what he said but others would not believe they disagreed among themselves and began to leave after paul had made this final statement the holy spirit spoke the truth to your forefathers when he said through isaiah the prophet go to this people and say you will be ever hearing but never understanding you will be ever seeing but never perceiving for this peoples heart has become calloused they hardly hear with their ears and they have closed their eyes otherwise they might see with their eyes hear with their ears understand with their hearts and turn and i would heal them therefore i want you to know that gods salvation has been sent to the gentiles and they will listen see footnote for two whole years paul stayed there in his own rented house and welcomed all who came to see him boldly and without hindrance he preached the kingdom of god and taught about the lord jesus christ  paul a servant of christ jesus called to be an apostle and set apart for the gospel of god the gospel he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy scriptures regarding his son who as to his human nature was a descendant of david and who through the spirit of holiness was declared with power to be the son of god by his resurrection from the dead jesus christ our lord through him and for his names sake we received grace and apostleship to call people from among all the gentiles to the obedience that comes from faith and you also are among those who are called to belong to jesus christ to all in rome who are loved by god and called to be saints grace and peace to you from god our father and from the lord jesus christ first i thank my god through jesus christ for all of you because your faith is being reported all over the world god whom i serve with my whole heart in preaching the gospel of his son is my witness how constantly i remember you in my prayers at all times and i pray that now at last by gods will the way may be opened for me to come to you i long to see you so that i may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong that is that you and i may be mutually encouraged by each others faith i do not want you to be unaware brothers that i planned many times to come to you but have been prevented from doing so until now in order that i might have a harvest among you just as i have had among the other gentiles i am obligated both to greeks and non greeks both to the wise and the foolish that is why i am so eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at rome i am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of god for the salvation of everyone who believes first for the jew then for the gentile for in the gospel a righteousness from god is revealed a righteousness that is by faith from first to last just as it is written the righteous will live by faith the wrath of god is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness since what may be known about god is plain to them because god has made it plain to them for since the creation of the world gods invisible qualities his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen being understood from what has been made so that men are without excuse for although they knew god they neither glorified him as god nor gave thanks to him but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened although they claimed to be wise they became fools and exchanged the glory of the immortal god for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles therefore god gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another they exchanged the truth of god for a lie and worshiped and served created things rather than the creator who is forever praised amen because of this god gave them over to shameful lusts even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones in the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another men committed indecent acts with other men and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion furthermore since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of god he gave them over to a depraved mind to do what ought not to be done they have become filled with every kind of wickedness evil greed and depravity they are full of envy murder strife deceit and malice they are gossips slanderers god haters insolent arrogant and boastful they invent ways of doing evil they disobey their parents they are senseless faithless heartless ruthless although they know gods righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them you therefore have no excuse you who pass judgment on someone else for at whatever point you judge the other you are condemning yourself because you who pass judgment do the same things now we know that gods judgment against those who do such things is based on truth so when you a mere man pass judgment on them and yet do the same things do you think you will escape gods judgment or do you show contempt for the riches of his kindness tolerance and patience not realizing that gods kindness leads you toward repentance but because of your stubbornness and your unrepentant heart you are storing up wrath against yourself for the day of gods wrath when his righteous judgment will be revealed god will give to each person according to what he has done to those who by persistence in doing good seek glory honor and immortality he will give eternal life but for those who are self seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil there will be wrath and anger there will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil first for the jew then for the gentile but glory honor and peace for everyone who does good first for the jew then for the gentile for god does not show favoritism all who sin apart from the law will also perish apart from the law and all who sin under the law will be judged by the law for it is not those who hear the law who are righteous in gods sight but it is those who obey the law who will be declared righteous indeed when gentiles who do not have the law do by nature things required by the law they are a law for themselves even though they do not have the law since they show that the requirements of the law are written on their hearts their consciences also bearing witness and their thoughts now accusing now even defending them this will take place on the day when god will judge mens secrets through jesus christ as my gospel declares now you if you call yourself a jew if you rely on the law and brag about your relationship to god if you know his will and approve of what is superior because you are instructed by the law if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind a light for those who are in the dark an instructor of the foolish a teacher of infants because you have in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth you then who teach others do you not teach yourself you who preach against stealing do you steal you who say that people should not commit adultery do you commit adultery you who abhor idols do you rob temples you who brag about the law do you dishonor god by breaking the law as it is written gods name is blasphemed among the gentiles because of you circumcision has value if you observe the law but if you break the law you have become as though you had not been circumcised if those who are not circumcised keep the laws requirements will they not be regarded as though they were circumcised the one who is not circumcised physically and yet obeys the law will condemn you who even though you have the written code and circumcision are a lawbreaker a man is not a jew if he is only one outwardly nor is circumcision merely outward and physical no a man is a jew if he is one inwardly and circumcision is circumcision of the heart by the spirit not by the written code such a mans praise is not from men but from god what advantage then is there in being a jew or what value is there in circumcision much in every way first of all they have been entrusted with the very words of god what if some did not have faith will their lack of faith nullify gods faithfulness not at all let god be true and every man a liar as it is written so that you may be proved right when you speak and prevail when you judge but if our unrighteousness brings out gods righteousness more clearly what shall we say that god is unjust in bringing his wrath on us i am using a human argument certainly not if that were so how could god judge the world someone might argue if my falsehood enhances gods truthfulness and so increases his glory why am i still condemned as a sinner why not say as we are being slanderously reported as saying and as some claim that we say let us do evil that good may result their condemnation is deserved what shall we conclude then are we any better not at all we have already made the charge that jews and gentiles alike are all under sin as it is written there is no one righteous not even one there is no one who understands no one who seeks god all have turned away they have together become worthless there is no one who does good not even one their throats are open graves their tongues practice deceitthe poison of vipers is on their lips their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness their feet are swift to shed blood ruin and misery mark their ways and the way of peace they do not know there is no fear of god before their eyes now we know that whatever the law says it says to those who are under the law so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to god therefore no one will be declared righteous in his sight by observing the law rather through the law we become conscious of sin but now a righteousness from god apart from law has been made known to which the law and the prophets testify this righteousness from god comes through faith in jesus christ to all who believe there is no difference for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by christ jesus god presented him as a sacrifice of atonement through faith in his blood he did this to demonstrate his justice because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished he did it to demonstrate his justice at the present time so as to be just and the one who justifies those who have faith in jesus where then is boasting it is excluded on what principle on that of observing the law no but on that of faith for we maintain that a man is justified by faith apart from observing the law is god the god of jews only is he not the god of gentiles too yes of gentiles too since there is only one god who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through that same faith do we then nullify the law by this faith not at all rather we uphold the law what then shall we say that abraham our forefather discovered in this matter if in fact abraham was justified by works he had something to boast about but not before god what does the scripture say abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness now when a man works his wages are not credited to him as a gift but as an obligation however to the man who does not work but trusts god who justifies the wicked his faith is credited as righteousness david says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom god credits righteousness apart from works blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven whose sins are covered blessed is the man whose sin the lord will never count against him is this blessedness only for the circumcised or also for the uncircumcised we have been saying that abrahams faith was credited to him as righteousness under what circumstances was it credited was it after he was circumcised or before it was not after but before and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised so then he is the father of all who believe but have not been circumcised in order that righteousness might be credited to them and he is also the father of the circumcised who not only are circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father abraham had before he was circumcised it was not through law that abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world but through the righteousness that comes by faith for if those who live by law are heirs faith has no value and the promise is worthless because law brings wrath and where there is no law there is no transgression therefore the promise comes by faith so that it may be by grace and may be guaranteed to all abrahams offspring not only to those who are of the law but also to those who are of the faith of abraham he is the father of us all as it is written i have made you a father of many nations he is our father in the sight of god in whom he believed the god who gives life to the dead and calls things that are not as though they were against all hope abraham in hope believed and so became the father of many nations just as it had been said to him so shall your offspring be without weakening in his faith he faced the fact that his body was as good as dead since he was about a hundred years old and that sarahs womb was also dead yet he did not waver through unbelief regarding the promise of god but was strengthened in his faith and gave glory to god being fully persuaded that god had power to do what he had promised this is why it was credited to him as righteousness the words it was credited to him were written not for him alone but also for us to whom god will credit righteousness for us who believe in him who raised jesus our lord from the dead he was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification therefore since we have been justified through faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of god not only so but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us you see at just the right time when we were still powerless christ died for the ungodly very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man though for a good man someone might possibly dare to die but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from gods wrath through him for if when we were gods enemies we were reconciled to him through the death of his son how much more having been reconciled shall we be saved through his life not only is this so but we also rejoice in god through our lord jesus christ through whom we have now received reconciliation therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned for before the law was given sin was in the world but sin is not taken into account when there is no law nevertheless death reigned from the time of adam to the time of moses even over those who did not sin by breaking a command as did adam who was a pattern of the one to come but the gift is not like the trespass for if the many died by the trespass of the one man how much more did gods grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man jesus christ overflow to the many again the gift of god is not like the result of the one mans sin the judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification for if by the trespass of the one man death reigned through that one man how much more will those who receive gods abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man jesus christ consequently just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous the law was added so that the trespass might increase but where sin increased grace increased all the more so that just as sin reigned in death so also grace might reign through righteousness to bring eternal life through jesus christ our lord what shall we say then shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase by no means we died to sin how can we live in it any longer or dont you know that all of us who were baptized into christ jesus were baptized into his death we were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the father we too may live a new life if we have been united with him like this in his death we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection for we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with that we should no longer be slaves to sin because anyone who has died has been freed from sin now if we died with christ we believe that we will also live with him for we know that since christ was raised from the dead he cannot die again death no longer has mastery over him the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its evil desires do not offer the parts of your body to sin as instruments of wickedness but rather offer yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness for sin shall not be your master because you are not under law but under grace what then shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace by no means dont you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves you are slaves to the one whom you obey whether you are slaves to sin which leads to death or to obedience which leads to righteousness but thanks be to god that though you used to be slaves to sin you wholeheartedly obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to righteousness i put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever increasing wickedness so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness when you were slaves to sin you were free from the control of righteousness what benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of those things result in death but now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to god the benefit you reap leads to holiness and the result is eternal life for the wages of sin is death but the gift of god is eternal life in christ jesus our lord do you not know brothers for i am speaking to men who know the law that the law has authority over a man only as long as he lives for example by law a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage so then if she marries another man while her husband is still alive she is called an adulteress but if her husband dies she is released from that law and is not an adulteress even though she marries another man so my brothers you also died to the law through the body of christ that you might belong to another to him who was raised from the dead in order that we might bear fruit to god for when we were controlled by the sinful nature the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies so that we bore fruit for death but now by dying to what once bound us we have been released from the law so that we serve in the new way of the spirit and not in the old way of the written code what shall we say then is the law sin certainly not indeed i would not have known what sin was except through the law for i would not have known what coveting really was if the law had not said do not covet but sin seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment produced in me every kind of covetous desire for apart from law sin is dead once i was alive apart from law but when the commandment came sin sprang to life and i died i found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death for sin seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment deceived me and through the commandment put me to death so then the law is holy and the commandment is holy righteous and good did that which is good then become death to me by no means but in order that sin might be recognized as sin it produced death in me through what was good so that through the commandment sin might become utterly sinful we know that the law is spiritual but i am unspiritual sold as a slave to sin i do not understand what i do for what i want to do i do not do but what i hate i do and if i do what i do not want to do i agree that the law is good as it is it is no longer i myself who do it but it is sin living in me i know that nothing good lives in me that is in my sinful nature for i have the desire to do what is good but i cannot carry it out for what i do is not the good i want to do no the evil i do not want to do this i keep on doing now if i do what i do not want to do it is no longer i who do it but it is sin living in me that does it so i find this law at work when i want to do good evil is right there with me for in my inner being i delight in gods law but i see another law at work in the members of my body waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members what a wretched man i am who will rescue me from this body of death thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then i myself in my mind am a slave to gods law but in the sinful nature a slave to the law of sin therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus because through christ jesus the law of the spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death for what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature god did by sending his own son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering and so he condemned sin in sinful man in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the spirit those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires but those who live in accordance with the spirit have their minds set on what the spirit desires the mind of sinful man is death but the mind controlled by the spirit is life and peace the sinful mind is hostile to god it does not submit to gods law nor can it do so those controlled by the sinful nature cannot please god you however are controlled not by the sinful nature but by the spirit if the spirit of god lives in you and if anyone does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to christ but if christ is in you your body is dead because of sin yet your spirit is alive because of righteousness and if the spirit of him who raised jesus from the dead is living in you he who raised christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his spirit who lives in you therefore brothers we have an obligation but it is not to the sinful nature to live according to it for if you live according to the sinful nature you will die but if by the spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body you will live because those who are led by the spirit of god are sons of god for you did not receive a spirit that makes you a slave again to fear but you received the spirit of sonship and by him we cry abba father the spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are gods children now if we are children then we are heirs heirs of god and co heirs with christ if indeed we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory i consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of god to be revealed for the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of god we know that the whole creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time not only so but we ourselves who have the firstfruits of the spirit groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as sons the redemption of our bodies for in this hope we were saved but hope that is seen is no hope at all who hopes for what he already has but if we hope for what we do not yet have we wait for it patiently in the same way the spirit helps us in our weakness we do not know what we ought to pray for but the spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express and he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the spirit because the spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with gods will and we know that in all things god works for the good of those who love him who have been called according to his purpose for those god foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and those he predestined he also called those he called he also justified those he justified he also glorified what then shall we say in response to this if god is for us who can be against us he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things who will bring any charge against those whom god has chosen it is god who justifies who is he that condemns christ jesus who died more than that who was raised to life is at the right hand of god and is also interceding for us who shall separate us from the love of christ shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword as it is written for your sake we face death all day long we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered no in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us for i am convinced that neither death nor life neither angels nor demons neither the present nor the future nor any powers neither height nor depth nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus our lord i speak the truth in christ i am not lying my conscience confirms it in the holy spirit i have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart for i could wish that i myself were cursed and cut off from christ for the sake of my brothers those of my own race the people of israel theirs is the adoption as sons theirs the divine glory the covenants the receiving of the law the temple worship and the promises theirs are the patriarchs and from them is traced the human ancestry of christ who is god over all forever praised amen it is not as though gods word had failed for not all who are descended from israel are israel nor because they are his descendants are they all abrahams children on the contrary it is through isaac that your offspring will be reckoned in other words it is not the natural children who are gods children but it is the children of the promise who are regarded as abrahams offspring for this was how the promise was stated at the appointed time i will return and sarah will have a son not only that but rebekahs children had one and the same father our father isaac yet before the twins were born or had done anything good or bad in order that gods purpose in election might stand not by works but by him who calls she was told the older will serve the younger just as it is written jacob i loved but esau i hated what then shall we say is god unjust not at all for he says to moses i will have mercy on whom i have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i have compassion it does not therefore depend on mans desire or effort but on gods mercy for the scripture says to pharaoh i raised you up for this very purpose that i might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth therefore god has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy and he hardens whom he wants to harden one of you will say to me then why does god still blame us for who resists his will but who are you o man to talk back to god shall what is formed say to him who formed it why did you make me like this does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use what if god choosing to show his wrath and make his power known bore with great patience the objects of his wrath prepared for destruction what if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy whom he prepared in advance for glory even us whom he also called not only from the jews but also from the gentiles as he says in hosea i will call them my people who are not my people and i will call her my loved one who is not my loved one and it will happen that in the very place where it was said to them you are not my people they will be called sons of the living god isaiah cries out concerning israel though the number of the israelites be like the sand by the sea only the remnant will be saved for the lord will carry out his sentence on earth with speed and finality it is just as isaiah said previously unless the lord almighty had left us descendants we would have become like sodom we would have been like gomorrah what then shall we say that the gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have obtained it a righteousness that is by faith but israel who pursued a law of righteousness has not attained it why not because they pursued it not by faith but as if it were by works they stumbled over the stumbling stone as it is written see i lay in zion a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame brothers my hearts desire and prayer to god for the israelites is that they may be saved for i can testify about them that they are zealous for god but their zeal is not based on knowledge since they did not know the righteousness that comes from god and sought to establish their own they did not submit to gods righteousness christ is the end of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes moses describes in this way the righteousness that is by the law the man who does these things will live by them but the righteousness that is by faith says do not say in your heart who will ascend into heaven that is to bring christ down or who will descend into the deep that is to bring christ up from the dead but what does it say the word is near you it is in your mouth and in your heart that is the word of faith we are proclaiming that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved for it is with your heart that you believe and are justified and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved as the scripture says anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame for there is no difference between jew and gentile the same lord is lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him for everyone who calls on the name of the lord will be saved how then can they call on the one they have not believed in and how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard and how can they hear without someone preaching to them and how can they preach unless they are sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of those who bring good news but not all the israelites accepted the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ but i ask did they not hear of course they did their voice has gone out into all the earth their words to the ends of the world again i ask did israel not understand first moses says i will make you envious by those who are not a nation i will make you angry by a nation that has no understanding and isaiah boldly says i was found by those who did not seek me i revealed myself to those who did not ask for me but concerning israel he says all day long i have held out my hands to a disobedient and obstinate people i ask then did god reject his people by no means i am an israelite myself a descendant of abraham from the tribe of benjamin god did not reject his people whom he foreknew dont you know what the scripture says in the passage about elijah how he appealed to god against israel lord they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars i am the only one left and they are trying to kill me and what was gods answer to him i have reserved for myself seven thousand who have not bowed the knee to baal so too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace and if by grace then it is no longer by works if it were grace would no longer be grace what then what israel sought so earnestly it did not obtain but the elect did the others were hardened as it is written god gave them a spirit of stupor eyes so that they could not see and ears so that they could not hear to this very day and david says may their table become a snare and a trap a stumbling block and a retribution for them may their eyes be darkened so they cannot see and their backs be bent forever again i ask did they stumble so as to fall beyond recovery not at all rather because of their transgression salvation has come to the gentiles to make israel envious but if their transgression means riches for the world and their loss means riches for the gentiles how much greater riches will their fullness bring i am talking to you gentiles inasmuch as i am the apostle to the gentiles i make much of my ministry in the hope that i may somehow arouse my own people to envy and save some of them for if their rejection is the reconciliation of the world what will their acceptance be but life from the dead if the part of the dough offered as firstfruits is holy then the whole batch is holy if the root is holy so are the branches if some of the branches have been broken off and you though a wild olive shoot have been grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing sap from the olive root do not boast over those branches if you do consider this you do not support the root but the root supports you you will say then branches were broken off so that i could be grafted in granted but they were broken off because of unbelief and you stand by faith do not be arrogant but be afraid for if god did not spare the natural branches he will not spare you either consider therefore the kindness and sternness of god sternness to those who fell but kindness to you provided that you continue in his kindness otherwise you also will be cut off and if they do not persist in unbelief they will be grafted in for god is able to graft them in again after all if you were cut out of an olive tree that is wild by nature and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree how much more readily will these the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree i do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery brothers so that you may not be conceited israel has experienced a hardening in part until the full number of the gentiles has come in and so all israel will be saved as it is written the deliverer will come from zion he will turn godlessness away from jacob and this is my covenant with them when i take away their sins as far as the gospel is concerned they are enemies on your account but as far as election is concerned they are loved on account of the patriarchs for gods gifts and his call are irrevocable just as you who were at one time disobedient to god have now received mercy as a result of their disobedience so they too have now become disobedient in order that they too may now receive mercy as a result of gods mercy to you for god has bound all men over to disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all oh the depth of the riches of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable his judgments and his paths beyond tracing out who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor who has ever given to god that god should repay him for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be the glory forever amen therefore i urge you brothers in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind then you will be able to test and approve what gods will is his good pleasing and perfect will for by the grace given me i say to every one of you do not think of yourself more highly than you ought but rather think of yourself with sober judgment in accordance with the measure of faith god has given you just as each of us has one body with many members and these members do not all have the same function so in christ we who are many form one body and each member belongs to all the others we have different gifts according to the grace given us if a mans gift is prophesying let him use it in proportion to his faith if it is serving let him serve if it is teaching let him teach if it is encouraging let him encourage if it is contributing to the needs of others let him give generously if it is leadership let him govern diligently if it is showing mercy let him do it cheerfully love must be sincere hate what is evil cling to what is good be devoted to one another in brotherly love honor one another above yourselves never be lacking in zeal but keep your spiritual fervor serving the lord be joyful in hope patient in affliction faithful in prayer share with gods people who are in need practice hospitality bless those who persecute you bless and do not curse rejoice with those who rejoice mourn with those who mourn live in harmony with one another do not be proud but be willing to associate with people of low position do not be conceited do not repay anyone evil for evil be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody if it is possible as far as it depends on you live at peace with everyone do not take revenge my friends but leave room for gods wrath for it is written it is mine to avenge i will repay says the lord on the contrary if your enemy is hungry feed him if he is thirsty give him something to drink in doing this you will heap burning coals on his head do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities for there is no authority except that which god has established the authorities that exist have been established by god consequently he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what god has instituted and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves for rulers hold no terror for those who do right but for those who do wrong do you want to be free from fear of the one in authority then do what is right and he will commend you for he is gods servant to do you good but if you do wrong be afraid for he does not bear the sword for nothing he is gods servant an agent of wrath to bring punishment on the wrongdoer therefore it is necessary to submit to the authorities not only because of possible punishment but also because of conscience this is also why you pay taxes for the authorities are gods servants who give their full time to governing give everyone what you owe him if you owe taxes pay taxes if revenue then revenue if respect then respect if honor then honor let no debt remain outstanding except the continuing debt to love one another for he who loves his fellowman has fulfilled the law the commandments do not commit adulterydo not murderdo not stealdo not covet and whatever other commandment there may be are summed up in this one rule love your neighbor as yourself love does no harm to its neighbor therefore love is the fulfillment of the law and do this understanding the present time the hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed the night is nearly over the day is almost here so let us put aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light let us behave decently as in the daytime not in orgies and drunkenness not in sexual immorality and debauchery not in dissension and jealousy rather clothe yourselves with the lord jesus christ and do not think about how to gratify the desires of the sinful nature accept him whose faith is weak without passing judgment on disputable matters one mans faith allows him to eat everything but another man whose faith is weak eats only vegetables the man who eats everything must not look down on him who does not and the man who does not eat everything must not condemn the man who does for god has accepted him who are you to judge someone elses servant to his own master he stands or falls and he will stand for the lord is able to make him stand one man considers one day more sacred than another another man considers every day alike each one should be fully convinced in his own mind he who regards one day as special does so to the lord he who eats meat eats to the lord for he gives thanks to god and he who abstains does so to the lord and gives thanks to god for none of us lives to himself alone and none of us dies to himself alone if we live we live to the lord and if we die we die to the lord so whether we live or die we belong to the lord for this very reason christ died and returned to life so that he might be the lord of both the dead and the living you then why do you judge your brother or why do you look down on your brother for we will all stand before gods judgment seat it is written as surely as i live says the lord every knee will bow before me every tongue will confess to god so then each of us will give an account of himself to god therefore let us stop passing judgment on one another instead make up your mind not to put any stumbling block or obstacle in your brothers way as one who is in the lord jesus i am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself but if anyone regards something as unclean then for him it is unclean if your brother is distressed because of what you eat you are no longer acting in love do not by your eating destroy your brother for whom christ died do not allow what you consider good to be spoken of as evil for the kingdom of god is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness peace and joy in the holy spirit because anyone who serves christ in this way is pleasing to god and approved by men let us therefore make every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification do not destroy the work of god for the sake of food all food is clean but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble it is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall so whatever you believe about these things keep between yourself and god blessed is the man who does not condemn himself by what he approves but the man who has doubts is condemned if he eats because his eating is not from faith and everything that does not come from faith is sin we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves each of us should please his neighbor for his good to build him up for even christ did not please himself but as it is written the insults of those who insult you have fallen on me for everything that was written in the past was written to teach us so that through endurance and the encouragement of the scriptures we might have hope may the god who gives endurance and encouragement give you a spirit of unity among yourselves as you follow christ jesus so that with one heart and mouth you may glorify the god and father of our lord jesus christ accept one another then just as christ accepted you in order to bring praise to god for i tell you that christ has become a servant of the jews on behalf of gods truth to confirm the promises made to the patriarchs so that the gentiles may glorify god for his mercy as it is written therefore i will praise you among the gentiles i will sing hymns to your name again it says rejoice o gentiles with his people and again praise the lord all you gentiles and sing praises to him all you peoples and again isaiah says the root of jesse will spring up one who will arise to rule over the nations the gentiles will hope in him may the god of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the holy spirit i myself am convinced my brothers that you yourselves are full of goodness complete in knowledge and competent to instruct one another i have written you quite boldly on some points as if to remind you of them again because of the grace god gave me to be a minister of christ jesus to the gentiles with the priestly duty of proclaiming the gospel of god so that the gentiles might become an offering acceptable to god sanctified by the holy spirit therefore i glory in christ jesus in my service to god i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me in leading the gentiles to obey god by what i have said and done by the power of signs and miracles through the power of the spirit so from jerusalem all the way around to illyricum i have fully proclaimed the gospel of christ it has always been my ambition to preach the gospel where christ was not known so that i would not be building on someone elses foundation rather as it is written those who were not told about him will see and those who have not heard will understand this is why i have often been hindered from coming to you but now that there is no more place for me to work in these regions and since i have been longing for many years to see you i plan to do so when i go to spain i hope to visit you while passing through and to have you assist me on my journey there after i have enjoyed your company for a while now however i am on my way to jerusalem in the service of the saints there for macedonia and achaia were pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the saints in jerusalem they were pleased to do it and indeed they owe it to them for if the gentiles have shared in the jews spiritual blessings they owe it to the jews to share with them their material blessings so after i have completed this task and have made sure that they have received this fruit i will go to spain and visit you on the way i know that when i come to you i will come in the full measure of the blessing of christ i urge you brothers by our lord jesus christ and by the love of the spirit to join me in my struggle by praying to god for me pray that i may be rescued from the unbelievers in judea and that my service in jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints there so that by gods will i may come to you with joy and together with you be refreshed the god of peace be with you all amen i commend to you our sister phoebe a servant of the church in cenchrea i ask you to receive her in the lord in a way worthy of the saints and to give her any help she may need from you for she has been a great help to many people including me greet priscilla and aquila my fellow workers in christ jesus they risked their lives for me not only i but all the churches of the gentiles are grateful to them greet also the church that meets at their house greet my dear friend epenetus who was the first convert to christ in the province of asia greet mary who worked very hard for you greet andronicus and junias my relatives who have been in prison with me they are outstanding among the apostles and they were in christ before i was greet ampliatus whom i love in the lord greet urbanus our fellow worker in christ and my dear friend stachys greet apelles tested and approved in christ greet those who belong to the household of aristobulus greet herodion my relative greet those in the household of narcissus who are in the lord greet tryphena and tryphosa those women who work hard in the lord greet my dear friend persis another woman who has worked very hard in the lord greet rufus chosen in the lord and his mother who has been a mother to me too greet asyncritus phlegon hermes patrobas hermas and the brothers with them greet philologus julia nereus and his sister and olympas and all the saints with them greet one another with a holy kiss all the churches of christ send greetings i urge you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and put obstacles in your way that are contrary to the teaching you have learned keep away from them for such people are not serving our lord christ but their own appetites by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the minds of naive people everyone has heard about your obedience so i am full of joy over you but i want you to be wise about what is good and innocent about what is evil the god of peace will soon crush satan under your feet the grace of our lord jesus be with you timothy my fellow worker sends his greetings to you as do lucius jason and sosipater my relatives i tertius who wrote down this letter greet you in the lord gaius whose hospitality i and the whole church here enjoy sends you his greetings erastus who is the citys director of public works and our brother quartus send you their greetings see footnote now to him who is able to establish you by my gospel and the proclamation of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery hidden for long ages past but now revealed and made known through the prophetic writings by the command of the eternal god so that all nations might believe and obey him to the only wise god be glory forever through jesus christ amen  paul called to be an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and our brother sosthenes to the church of god in corinth to those sanctified in christ jesus and called to be holy together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our lord jesus christ their lord and ours grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ i always thank god for you because of his grace given you in christ jesus for in him you have been enriched in every way in all your speaking and in all your knowledge because our testimony about christ was confirmed in you therefore you do not lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our lord jesus christ to be revealed he will keep you strong to the end so that you will be blameless on the day of our lord jesus christ god who has called you into fellowship with his son jesus christ our lord is faithful i appeal to you brothers in the name of our lord jesus christ that all of you agree with one another so that there may be no divisions among you and that you may be perfectly united in mind and thought my brothers some from chloes household have informed me that there are quarrels among you what i mean is this one of you says i follow paul another i follow apollos another i follow cephas still another i follow christ is christ divided was paul crucified for you were you baptized into the name of paul i am thankful that i did not baptize any of you except crispus and gaius so no one can say that you were baptized into my name yes i also baptized the household of stephanas beyond that i dont remember if i baptized anyone else for christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel not with words of human wisdom lest the cross of christ be emptied of its power for the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing but to us who are being saved it is the power of god for it is written i will destroy the wisdom of the wise the intelligence of the intelligent i will frustrate where is the wise man where is the scholar where is the philosopher of this age has not god made foolish the wisdom of the world for since in the wisdom of god the world through its wisdom did not know him god was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe jews demand miraculous signs and greeks look for wisdom but we preach christ crucified a stumbling block to jews and foolishness to gentiles but to those whom god has called both jews and greeks christ the power of god and the wisdom of god for the foolishness of god is wiser than mans wisdom and the weakness of god is stronger than mans strength brothers think of what you were when you were called not many of you were wise by human standards not many were influential not many were of noble birth but god chose the foolish things of the world to shame the wise god chose the weak things of the world to shame the strong he chose the lowly things of this world and the despised things and the things that are not to nullify the things that are so that no one may boast before him it is because of him that you are in christ jesus who has become for us wisdom from god that is our righteousness holiness and redemption therefore as it is written let him who boasts boast in the lord when i came to you brothers i did not come with eloquence or superior wisdom as i proclaimed to you the testimony about god for i resolved to know nothing while i was with you except jesus christ and him crucified i came to you in weakness and fear and with much trembling my message and my preaching were not with wise and persuasive words but with a demonstration of the spirits power so that your faith might not rest on mens wisdom but on gods power we do however speak a message of wisdom among the mature but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age who are coming to nothing no we speak of gods secret wisdom a wisdom that has been hidden and that god destined for our glory before time began none of the rulers of this age understood it for if they had they would not have crucified the lord of glory however as it is written no eye has seen no ear has heard no mind has conceived what god has prepared for those who love him but god has revealed it to us by his spirit the spirit searches all things even the deep things of god for who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the mans spirit within him in the same way no one knows the thoughts of god except the spirit of god we have not received the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god that we may understand what god has freely given us this is what we speak not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the spirit expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words the man without the spirit does not accept the things that come from the spirit of god for they are foolishness to him and he cannot understand them because they are spiritually discerned the spiritual man makes judgments about all things but he himself is not subject to any mans judgment for who has known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ brothers i could not address you as spiritual but as worldly mere infants in christ i gave you milk not solid food for you were not yet ready for it indeed you are still not ready you are still worldly for since there is jealousy and quarreling among you are you not worldly are you not acting like mere men for when one says i follow paul and another i follow apollos are you not mere men what after all is apollos and what is paul only servants through whom you came to believe as the lord has assigned to each his task i planted the seed apollos watered it but god made it grow so neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything but only god who makes things grow the man who plants and the man who waters have one purpose and each will be rewarded according to his own labor for we are gods fellow workers you are gods field gods building by the grace god has given me i laid a foundation as an expert builder and someone else is building on it but each one should be careful how he builds for no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid which is jesus christ if any man builds on this foundation using gold silver costly stones wood hay or straw his work will be shown for what it is because the day will bring it to light it will be revealed with fire and the fire will test the quality of each mans work if what he has built survives he will receive his reward if it is burned up he will suffer loss he himself will be saved but only as one escaping through the flames dont you know that you yourselves are gods temple and that gods spirit lives in you if anyone destroys gods temple god will destroy him for gods temple is sacred and you are that temple do not deceive yourselves if any one of you thinks he is wise by the standards of this age he should become a fool so that he may become wise for the wisdom of this world is foolishness in gods sight as it is written he catches the wise in their craftiness and again the lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile so then no more boasting about men all things are yours whether paul or apollos or cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future all are yours and you are of christ and christ is of god so then men ought to regard us as servants of christ and as those entrusted with the secret things of god now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful i care very little if i am judged by you or by any human court indeed i do not even judge myself my conscience is clear but that does not make me innocent it is the lord who judges me therefore judge nothing before the appointed time wait till the lord comes he will bring to light what is hidden in darkness and will expose the motives of mens hearts at that time each will receive his praise from god now brothers i have applied these things to myself and apollos for your benefit so that you may learn from us the meaning of the saying do not go beyond what is written then you will not take pride in one man over against another for who makes you different from anyone else what do you have that you did not receive and if you did receive it why do you boast as though you did not already you have all you want already you have become rich you have become kings and that without us how i wish that you really had become kings so that we might be kings with you for it seems to me that god has put us apostles on display at the end of the procession like men condemned to die in the arena we have been made a spectacle to the whole universe to angels as well as to men we are fools for christ but you are so wise in christ we are weak but you are strong you are honored we are dishonored to this very hour we go hungry and thirsty we are in rags we are brutally treated we are homeless we work hard with our own hands when we are cursed we bless when we are persecuted we endure it when we are slandered we answer kindly up to this moment we have become the scum of the earth the refuse of the world i am not writing this to shame you but to warn you as my dear children even though you have ten thousand guardians in christ you do not have many fathers for in christ jesus i became your father through the gospel therefore i urge you to imitate me for this reason i am sending to you timothy my son whom i love who is faithful in the lord he will remind you of my way of life in christ jesus which agrees with what i teach everywhere in every church some of you have become arrogant as if i were not coming to you but i will come to you very soon if the lord is willing and then i will find out not only how these arrogant people are talking but what power they have for the kingdom of god is not a matter of talk but of power what do you prefer shall i come to you with a whip or in love and with a gentle spirit it is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you and of a kind that does not occur even among pagans a man has his fathers wife and you are proud shouldnt you rather have been filled with grief and have put out of your fellowship the man who did this even though i am not physically present i am with you in spirit and i have already passed judgment on the one who did this just as if i were present when you are assembled in the name of our lord jesus and i am with you in spirit and the power of our lord jesus is present hand this man over to satan so that the sinful nature may be destroyed and his spirit saved on the day of the lord your boasting is not good dont you know that a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast as you really are for christ our passover lamb has been sacrificed therefore let us keep the festival not with the old yeast the yeast of malice and wickedness but with bread without yeast the bread of sincerity and truth i have written you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral or the greedy and swindlers or idolaters in that case you would have to leave this world but now i am writing you that you must not associate with anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral or greedy an idolater or a slanderer a drunkard or a swindler with such a man do not even eat what business is it of mine to judge those outside the church are you not to judge those inside god will judge those outside expel the wicked man from among you if any of you has a dispute with another dare he take it before the ungodly for judgment instead of before the saints do you not know that the saints will judge the world and if you are to judge the world are you not competent to judge trivial cases do you not know that we will judge angels how much more the things of this life therefore if you have disputes about such matters appoint as judges even men of little account in the church i say this to shame you is it possible that there is nobody among you wise enough to judge a dispute between believers but instead one brother goes to law against another and this in front of unbelievers the very fact that you have lawsuits among you means you have been completely defeated already why not rather be wronged why not rather be cheated instead you yourselves cheat and do wrong and you do this to your brothers do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god and that is what some of you were but you were washed you were sanctified you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god everything is permissible for me but not everything is beneficial everything is permissible for me but i will not be mastered by anything food for the stomach and the stomach for food but god will destroy them both the body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the lord and the lord for the body by his power god raised the lord from the dead and he will raise us also do you not know that your bodies are members of christ himself shall i then take the members of christ and unite them with a prostitute never do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body for it is said the two will become one flesh but he who unites himself with the lord is one with him in spirit flee from sexual immorality all other sins a man commits are outside his body but he who sins sexually sins against his own body do you not know that your body is a temple of the holy spirit who is in you whom you have received from god you are not your own you were bought at a price therefore honor god with your body now for the matters you wrote about it is good for a man not to marry but since there is so much immorality each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband the husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife and likewise the wife to her husband the wifes body does not belong to her alone but also to her husband in the same way the husbands body does not belong to him alone but also to his wife do not deprive each other except by mutual consent and for a time so that you may devote yourselves to prayer then come together again so that satan will not tempt you because of your lack of self control i say this as a concession not as a command i wish that all men were as i am but each man has his own gift from god one has this gift another has that now to the unmarried and the widows i say it is good for them to stay unmarried as i am but if they cannot control themselves they should marry for it is better to marry than to burn with passion to the married i give this command not i but the lord a wife must not separate from her husband but if she does she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband and a husband must not divorce his wife to the rest i say this i not the lord if any brother has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to live with him he must not divorce her and if a woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to live with her she must not divorce him for the unbelieving husband has been sanctified through his wife and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband otherwise your children would be unclean but as it is they are holy but if the unbeliever leaves let him do so a believing man or woman is not bound in such circumstances god has called us to live in peace how do you know wife whether you will save your husband or how do you know husband whether you will save your wife nevertheless each one should retain the place in life that the lord assigned to him and to which god has called him this is the rule i lay down in all the churches was a man already circumcised when he was called he should not become uncircumcised was a man uncircumcised when he was called he should not be circumcised circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing keeping gods commands is what counts each one should remain in the situation which he was in when god called him were you a slave when you were called dont let it trouble you although if you can gain your freedom do so for he who was a slave when he was called by the lord is the lords freedman similarly he who was a free man when he was called is christs slave you were bought at a price do not become slaves of men brothers each man as responsible to god should remain in the situation god called him to now about virgins i have no command from the lord but i give a judgment as one who by the lords mercy is trustworthy because of the present crisis i think that it is good for you to remain as you are are you married do not seek a divorce are you unmarried do not look for a wife but if you do marry you have not sinned and if a virgin marries she has not sinned but those who marry will face many troubles in this life and i want to spare you this what i mean brothers is that the time is short from now on those who have wives should live as if they had none those who mourn as if they did not those who are happy as if they were not those who buy something as if it were not theirs to keep those who use the things of the world as if not engrossed in them for this world in its present form is passing away i would like you to be free from concern an unmarried man is concerned about the lords affairs how he can please the lord but a married man is concerned about the affairs of this world how he can please his wife and his interests are divided an unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the lords affairs her aim is to be devoted to the lord in both body and spirit but a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world how she can please her husband i am saying this for your own good not to restrict you but that you may live in a right way in undivided devotion to the lord if anyone thinks he is acting improperly toward the virgin he is engaged to and if she is getting along in years and he feels he ought to marry he should do as he wants he is not sinning they should get married but the man who has settled the matter in his own mind who is under no compulsion but has control over his own will and who has made up his mind not to marry the virgin this man also does the right thing so then he who marries the virgin does right but he who does not marry her does even better a woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives but if her husband dies she is free to marry anyone she wishes but he must belong to the lord in my judgment she is happier if she stays as she is and i think that i too have the spirit of god now about food sacrificed to idols we know that we all possess knowledge knowledge puffs up but love builds up the man who thinks he knows something does not yet know as he ought to know but the man who loves god is known by god so then about eating food sacrificed to idols we know that an idol is nothing at all in the world and that there is no god but one for even if there are so called gods whether in heaven or on earth as indeed there are many gods and many lords yet for us there is but one god the father from whom all things came and for whom we live and there is but one lord jesus christ through whom all things came and through whom we live but not everyone knows this some people are still so accustomed to idols that when they eat such food they think of it as having been sacrificed to an idol and since their conscience is weak it is defiled but food does not bring us near to god we are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do be careful however that the exercise of your freedom does not become a stumbling block to the weak for if anyone with a weak conscience sees you who have this knowledge eating in an idols temple wont he be emboldened to eat what has been sacrificed to idols so this weak brother for whom christ died is destroyed by your knowledge when you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak conscience you sin against christ therefore if what i eat causes my brother to fall into sin i will never eat meat again so that i will not cause him to fall am i not free am i not an apostle have i not seen jesus our lord are you not the result of my work in the lord even though i may not be an apostle to others surely i am to you for you are the seal of my apostleship in the lord this is my defense to those who sit in judgment on me dont we have the right to food and drink dont we have the right to take a believing wife along with us as do the other apostles and the lords brothers and cephas or is it only i and barnabas who must work for a living who serves as a soldier at his own expense who plants a vineyard and does not eat of its grapes who tends a flock and does not drink of the milk do i say this merely from a human point of view doesnt the law say the same thing for it is written in the law of moses do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain is it about oxen that god is concerned surely he says this for us doesnt he yes this was written for us because when the plowman plows and the thresher threshes they ought to do so in the hope of sharing in the harvest if we have sown spiritual seed among you is it too much if we reap a material harvest from you if others have this right of support from you shouldnt we have it all the more but we did not use this right on the contrary we put up with anything rather than hinder the gospel of christ dont you know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple and those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar in the same way the lord has commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel but i have not used any of these rights and i am not writing this in the hope that you will do such things for me i would rather die than have anyone deprive me of this boast yet when i preach the gospel i cannot boast for i am compelled to preach woe to me if i do not preach the gospel if i preach voluntarily i have a reward if not voluntarily i am simply discharging the trust committed to me what then is my reward just this that in preaching the gospel i may offer it free of charge and so not make use of my rights in preaching it though i am free and belong to no man i make myself a slave to everyone to win as many as possible to the jews i became like a jew to win the jews to those under the law i became like one under the law though i myself am not under the law so as to win those under the law to those not having the law i became like one not having the law though i am not free from gods law but am under christs law so as to win those not having the law to the weak i became weak to win the weak i have become all things to all men so that by all possible means i might save some i do all this for the sake of the gospel that i may share in its blessings do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one gets the prize run in such a way as to get the prize everyone who competes in the games goes into strict training they do it to get a crown that will not last but we do it to get a crown that will last forever therefore i do not run like a man running aimlessly i do not fight like a man beating the air no i beat my body and make it my slave so that after i have preached to others i myself will not be disqualified for the prize for i do not want you to be ignorant of the fact brothers that our forefathers were all under the cloud and that they all passed through the sea they were all baptized into moses in the cloud and in the sea they all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock that accompanied them and that rock was christ nevertheless god was not pleased with most of them their bodies were scattered over the desert now these things occurred as examples to keep us from setting our hearts on evil things as they did do not be idolaters as some of them were as it is written the people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry we should not commit sexual immorality as some of them did and in one day twenty three thousand of them died we should not test the lord as some of them did and were killed by snakes and do not grumble as some of them did and were killed by the destroying angel these things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us on whom the fulfillment of the ages has come so if you think you are standing firm be careful that you dont fall no temptation has seized you except what is common to man and god is faithful he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear but when you are tempted he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it therefore my dear friends flee from idolatry i speak to sensible people judge for yourselves what i say is not the cup of thanksgiving for which we give thanks a participation in the blood of christ and is not the bread that we break a participation in the body of christ because there is one loaf we who are many are one body for we all partake of the one loaf consider the people of israel do not those who eat the sacrifices participate in the altar do i mean then that a sacrifice offered to an idol is anything or that an idol is anything no but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons not to god and i do not want you to be participants with demons you cannot drink the cup of the lord and the cup of demons too you cannot have a part in both the lords table and the table of demons are we trying to arouse the lords jealousy are we stronger than he everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial everything is permissible but not everything is constructive nobody should seek his own good but the good of others eat anything sold in the meat market without raising questions of conscience for the earth is the lords and everything in it if some unbeliever invites you to a meal and you want to go eat whatever is put before you without raising questions of conscience but if anyone says to you this has been offered in sacrifice then do not eat it both for the sake of the man who told you and for conscience sake the other mans conscience i mean not yours for why should my freedom be judged by anothers conscience if i take part in the meal with thankfulness why am i denounced because of something i thank god for so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do it all for the glory of god do not cause anyone to stumble whether jews greeks or the church of god even as i try to please everybody in every way for i am not seeking my own good but the good of many so that they may be saved follow my example as i follow the example of christ i praise you for remembering me in everything and for holding to the teachings just as i passed them on to you now i want you to realize that the head of every man is christ and the head of the woman is man and the head of christ is god every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head it is just as though her head were shaved if a woman does not cover her head she should have her hair cut off and if it is a disgrace for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off she should cover her head a man ought not to cover his head since he is the image and glory of god but the woman is the glory of man for man did not come from woman but woman from man neither was man created for woman but woman for man for this reason and because of the angels the woman ought to have a sign of authority on her head in the lord however woman is not independent of man nor is man independent of woman for as woman came from man so also man is born of woman but everything comes from god judge for yourselves is it proper for a woman to pray to god with her head uncovered does not the very nature of things teach you that if a man has long hair it is a disgrace to him but that if a woman has long hair it is her glory for long hair is given to her as a covering if anyone wants to be contentious about this we have no other practice nor do the churches of god in the following directives i have no praise for you for your meetings do more harm than good in the first place i hear that when you come together as a church there are divisions among you and to some extent i believe it no doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have gods approval when you come together it is not the lords supper you eat for as you eat each of you goes ahead without waiting for anybody else one remains hungry another gets drunk dont you have homes to eat and drink in or do you despise the church of god and humiliate those who have nothing what shall i say to you shall i praise you for this certainly not for i received from the lord what i also passed on to you the lord jesus on the night he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he broke it and said this is my body which is for you do this in remembrance of me in the same way after supper he took the cup saying this cup is the new covenant in my blood do this whenever you drink it in remembrance of me for whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup you proclaim the lords death until he comes therefore whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the lord a man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup for anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the lord eats and drinks judgment on himself that is why many among you are weak and sick and a number of you have fallen asleep but if we judged ourselves we would not come under judgment when we are judged by the lord we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned with the world so then my brothers when you come together to eat wait for each other if anyone is hungry he should eat at home so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment and when i come i will give further directions now about spiritual gifts brothers i do not want you to be ignorant you know that when you were pagans somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols therefore i tell you that no one who is speaking by the spirit of god says jesus be cursed and no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit there are different kinds of gifts but the same spirit there are different kinds of service but the same lord there are different kinds of working but the same god works all of them in all men now to each one the manifestation of the spirit is given for the common good to one there is given through the spirit the message of wisdom to another the message of knowledge by means of the same spirit to another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by that one spirit to another miraculous powers to another prophecy to another distinguishing between spirits to another speaking in different kinds of tongues and to still another the interpretation of tongues all these are the work of one and the same spirit and he gives them to each one just as he determines the body is a unit though it is made up of many parts and though all its parts are many they form one body so it is with christ for we were all baptized by one spirit into one body whether jews or greeks slave or free and we were all given the one spirit to drink now the body is not made up of one part but of many if the foot should say because i am not a hand i do not belong to the body it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body and if the ear should say because i am not an eye i do not belong to the body it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body if the whole body were an eye where would the sense of hearing be if the whole body were an ear where would the sense of smell be but in fact god has arranged the parts in the body every one of them just as he wanted them to be if they were all one part where would the body be as it is there are many parts but one body the eye cannot say to the hand i dont need you and the head cannot say to the feet i dont need you on the contrary those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor and the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty while our presentable parts need no special treatment but god has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it so that there should be no division in the body but that its parts should have equal concern for each other if one part suffers every part suffers with it if one part is honored every part rejoices with it now you are the body of christ and each one of you is a part of it and in the church god has appointed first of all apostles second prophets third teachers then workers of miracles also those having gifts of healing those able to help others those with gifts of administration and those speaking in different kinds of tongues are all apostles are all prophets are all teachers do all work miracles do all have gifts of healing do all speak in tongues do all interpret but eagerly desire the greater gifts and now i will show you the most excellent way if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal if i have the gift of prophecy and can fathom all mysteries and all knowledge and if i have a faith that can move mountains but have not love i am nothing if i give all i possess to the poor and surrender my body to the flames but have not love i gain nothing love is patient love is kind it does not envy it does not boast it is not proud it is not rude it is not self seeking it is not easily angered it keeps no record of wrongs love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth it always protects always trusts always hopes always perseveres love never fails but where there are prophecies they will cease where there are tongues they will be stilled where there is knowledge it will pass away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when perfection comes the imperfect disappears when i was a child i talked like a child i thought like a child i reasoned like a child when i became a man i put childish ways behind me now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror then we shall see face to face now i know in part then i shall know fully even as i am fully known and now these three remain faith hope and love but the greatest of these is love follow the way of love and eagerly desire spiritual gifts especially the gift of prophecy for anyone who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to god indeed no one understands him he utters mysteries with his spirit but everyone who prophesies speaks to men for their strengthening encouragement and comfort he who speaks in a tongue edifies himself but he who prophesies edifies the church i would like every one of you to speak in tongues but i would rather have you prophesy he who prophesies is greater than one who speaks in tongues unless he interprets so that the church may be edified now brothers if i come to you and speak in tongues what good will i be to you unless i bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or word of instruction even in the case of lifeless things that make sounds such as the flute or harp how will anyone know what tune is being played unless there is a distinction in the notes again if the trumpet does not sound a clear call who will get ready for battle so it is with you unless you speak intelligible words with your tongue how will anyone know what you are saying you will just be speaking into the air undoubtedly there are all sorts of languages in the world yet none of them is without meaning if then i do not grasp the meaning of what someone is saying i am a foreigner to the speaker and he is a foreigner to me so it is with you since you are eager to have spiritual gifts try to excel in gifts that build up the church for this reason anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret what he says for if i pray in a tongue my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful so what shall i do i will pray with my spirit but i will also pray with my mind i will sing with my spirit but i will also sing with my mind if you are praising god with your spirit how can one who finds himself among those who do not understand say amen to your thanksgiving since he does not know what you are saying you may be giving thanks well enough but the other man is not edified i thank god that i speak in tongues more than all of you but in the church i would rather speak five intelligible words to instruct others than ten thousand words in a tongue brothers stop thinking like children in regard to evil be infants but in your thinking be adults in the law it is written through men of strange tongues and through the lips of foreigners i will speak to this people but even then they will not listen to me says the lord tongues then are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers prophecy however is for believers not for unbelievers so if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues and some who do not understand or some unbelievers come in will they not say that you are out of your mind but if an unbeliever or someone who does not understand comes in while everybody is prophesying he will be convinced by all that he is a sinner and will be judged by all and the secrets of his heart will be laid bare so he will fall down and worship god exclaiming god is really among you what then shall we say brothers when you come together everyone has a hymn or a word of instruction a revelation a tongue or an interpretation all of these must be done for the strengthening of the church if anyone speaks in a tongue two or at the most three should speak one at a time and someone must interpret if there is no interpreter the speaker should keep quiet in the church and speak to himself and god two or three prophets should speak and the others should weigh carefully what is said and if a revelation comes to someone who is sitting down the first speaker should stop for you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone may be instructed and encouraged the spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets for god is not a god of disorder but of peace as in all the congregations of the saints women should remain silent in the churches they are not allowed to speak but must be in submission as the law says if they want to inquire about something they should ask their own husbands at home for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church did the word of god originate with you or are you the only people it has reached if anybody thinks he is a prophet or spiritually gifted let him acknowledge that what i am writing to you is the lords command if he ignores this he himself will be ignored therefore my brothers be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues but everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way now brothers i want to remind you of the gospel i preached to you which you received and on which you have taken your stand by this gospel you are saved if you hold firmly to the word i preached to you otherwise you have believed in vain for what i received i passed on to you as of first importance that christ died for our sins according to the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures and that he appeared to peter and then to the twelve after that he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers at the same time most of whom are still living though some have fallen asleep then he appeared to james then to all the apostles and last of all he appeared to me also as to one abnormally born for i am the least of the apostles and do not even deserve to be called an apostle because i persecuted the church of god but by the grace of god i am what i am and his grace to me was not without effect no i worked harder than all of them yet not i but the grace of god that was with me whether then it was i or they this is what we preach and this is what you believed but if it is preached that christ has been raised from the dead how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead if there is no resurrection of the dead then not even christ has been raised and if christ has not been raised our preaching is useless and so is your faith more than that we are then found to be false witnesses about god for we have testified about god that he raised christ from the dead but he did not raise him if in fact the dead are not raised for if the dead are not raised then christ has not been raised either and if christ has not been raised your faith is futile you are still in your sins then those also who have fallen asleep in christ are lost if only for this life we have hope in christ we are to be pitied more than all men but christ has indeed been raised from the dead the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep for since death came through a man the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man for as in adam all die so in christ all will be made alive but each in his own turn christ the firstfruits then when he comes those who belong to him then the end will come when he hands over the kingdom to god the father after he has destroyed all dominion authority and power for he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet the last enemy to be destroyed is death for he has put everything under his feet now when it says that everything has been put under him it is clear that this does not include god himself who put everything under christ when he has done this then the son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him so that god may be all in all now if there is no resurrection what will those do who are baptized for the dead if the dead are not raised at all why are people baptized for them and as for us why do we endanger ourselves every hour i die every day i mean that brothers just as surely as i glory over you in christ jesus our lord if i fought wild beasts in ephesus for merely human reasons what have i gained if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die do not be misled bad company corrupts good character come back to your senses as you ought and stop sinning for there are some who are ignorant of god i say this to your shame but someone may ask how are the dead raised with what kind of body will they come how foolish what you sow does not come to life unless it dies when you sow you do not plant the body that will be but just a seed perhaps of wheat or of something else but god gives it a body as he has determined and to each kind of seed he gives its own body all flesh is not the same men have one kind of flesh animals have another birds another and fish another there are also heavenly bodies and there are earthly bodies but the splendor of the heavenly bodies is one kind and the splendor of the earthly bodies is another the sun has one kind of splendor the moon another and the stars another and star differs from star in splendor so will it be with the resurrection of the dead the body that is sown is perishable it is raised imperishable it is sown in dishonor it is raised in glory it is sown in weakness it is raised in power it is sown a natural body it is raised a spiritual body if there is a natural body there is also a spiritual body so it is written the first man adam became a living being the last adam a lifegiving spirit the spiritual did not come first but the natural and after that the spiritual the first man was of the dust of the earth the second man from heaven as was the earthly man so are those who are of the earth and as is the man from heaven so also are those who are of heaven and just as we have borne the likeness of the earthly man so shall we bear the likeness of the man from heaven i declare to you brothers that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable listen i tell you a mystery we will not all sleep but we will all be changed in a flash in the twinkling of an eye at the last trumpet for the trumpet will sound the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed for the perishable must clothe itself with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality when the perishable has been clothed with the imperishable and the mortal with immortality then the saying that is written will come true death has been swallowed up in victory where o death is your victory where o death is your sting the sting of death is sin and the power of sin is the law but thanks be to god he gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ therefore my dear brothers stand firm let nothing move you always give yourselves fully to the work of the lord because you know that your labor in the lord is not in vain now about the collection for gods people do what i told the galatian churches to do on the first day of every week each one of you should set aside a sum of money in keeping with his income saving it up so that when i come no collections will have to be made then when i arrive i will give letters of introduction to the men you approve and send them with your gift to jerusalem if it seems advisable for me to go also they will accompany me after i go through macedonia i will come to you for i will be going through macedonia perhaps i will stay with you awhile or even spend the winter so that you can help me on my journey wherever i go i do not want to see you now and make only a passing visit i hope to spend some time with you if the lord permits but i will stay on at ephesus until pentecost because a great door for effective work has opened to me and there are many who oppose me if timothy comes see to it that he has nothing to fear while he is with you for he is carrying on the work of the lord just as i am no one then should refuse to accept him send him on his way in peace so that he may return to me i am expecting him along with the brothers now about our brother apollos i strongly urged him to go to you with the brothers he was quite unwilling to go now but he will go when he has the opportunity be on your guard stand firm in the faith be men of courage be strong do everything in love you know that the household of stephanas were the first converts in achaia and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints i urge you brothers to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work and labors at it i was glad when stephanas fortunatus and achaicus arrived because they have supplied what was lacking from you for they refreshed my spirit and yours also such men deserve recognition the churches in the province of asia send you greetings aquila and priscilla greet you warmly in the lord and so does the church that meets at their house all the brothers here send you greetings greet one another with a holy kiss i paul write this greeting in my own hand if anyone does not love the lord a curse be on him come o lord the grace of the lord jesus be with you my love to all of you in christ jesus amen  paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the church of god in corinth together with all the saints throughout achaia grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of compassion and the god of all comfort who comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the comfort we ourselves have received from god for just as the sufferings of christ flow over into our lives so also through christ our comfort overflows if we are distressed it is for your comfort and salvation if we are comforted it is for your comfort which produces in you patient endurance of the same sufferings we suffer and our hope for you is firm because we know that just as you share in our sufferings so also you share in our comfort we do not want you to be uninformed brothers about the hardships we suffered in the province of asia we were under great pressure far beyond our ability to endure so that we despaired even of life indeed in our hearts we felt the sentence of death but this happened that we might not rely on ourselves but on god who raises the dead he has delivered us from such a deadly peril and he will deliver us on him we have set our hope that he will continue to deliver us as you help us by your prayers then many will give thanks on our behalf for the gracious favor granted us in answer to the prayers of many now this is our boast our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world and especially in our relations with you in the holiness and sincerity that are from god we have done so not according to worldly wisdom but according to gods grace for we do not write you anything you cannot read or understand and i hope that as you have understood us in part you will come to understand fully that you can boast of us just as we will boast of you in the day of the lord jesus because i was confident of this i planned to visit you first so that you might benefit twice i planned to visit you on my way to macedonia and to come back to you from macedonia and then to have you send me on my way to judea when i planned this did i do it lightly or do i make my plans in a worldly manner so that in the same breath i say yes yes and no no but as surely as god is faithful our message to you is not yes and no for the son of god jesus christ who was preached among you by me and silas and timothy was not yes and no but in him it has always been yes for no matter how many promises god has made they are yes in christ and so through him the amen is spoken by us to the glory of god now it is god who makes both us and you stand firm in christ he anointed us set his seal of ownership on us and put his spirit in our hearts as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come i call god as my witness that it was in order to spare you that i did not return to corinth not that we lord it over your faith but we work with you for your joy because it is by faith you stand firm so i made up my mind that i would not make another painful visit to you for if i grieve you who is left to make me glad but you whom i have grieved i wrote as i did so that when i came i should not be distressed by those who ought to make me rejoice i had confidence in all of you that you would all share my joy for i wrote you out of great distress and anguish of heart and with many tears not to grieve you but to let you know the depth of my love for you if anyone has caused grief he has not so much grieved me as he has grieved all of you to some extent not to put it too severely the punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient for him now instead you ought to forgive and comfort him so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow i urge you therefore to reaffirm your love for him the reason i wrote you was to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in everything if you forgive anyone i also forgive him and what i have forgiven if there was anything to forgive i have forgiven in the sight of christ for your sake in order that satan might not outwit us for we are not unaware of his schemes now when i went to troas to preach the gospel of christ and found that the lord had opened a door for me i still had no peace of mind because i did not find my brother titus there so i said good by to them and went on to macedonia but thanks be to god who always leads us in triumphal procession in christ and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of the knowledge of him for we are to god the aroma of christ among those who are being saved and those who are perishing to the one we are the smell of death to the other the fragrance of life and who is equal to such a task unlike so many we do not peddle the word of god for profit on the contrary in christ we speak before god with sincerity like men sent from god are we beginning to commend ourselves again or do we need like some people letters of recommendation to you or from you you yourselves are our letter written on our hearts known and read by everybody you show that you are a letter from christ the result of our ministry written not with ink but with the spirit of the living god not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts such confidence as this is ours through christ before god not that we are competent in ourselves to claim anything for ourselves but our competence comes from god he has made us competent as ministers of a new covenant not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kills but the spirit gives life now if the ministry that brought death which was engraved in letters on stone came with glory so that the israelites could not look steadily at the face of moses because of its glory fading though it was will not the ministry of the spirit be even more glorious if the ministry that condemns men is glorious how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness for what was glorious has no glory now in comparison with the surpassing glory and if what was fading away came with glory how much greater is the glory of that which lasts therefore since we have such a hope we are very bold we are not like moses who would put a veil over his face to keep the israelites from gazing at it while the radiance was fading away but their minds were made dull for to this day the same veil remains when the old covenant is read it has not been removed because only in christ is it taken away even to this day when moses is read a veil covers their hearts but whenever anyone turns to the lord the veil is taken away now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom and we who with unveiled faces all reflect the lords glory are being transformed into his likeness with ever increasing glory which comes from the lord who is the spirit therefore since through gods mercy we have this ministry we do not lose heart rather we have renounced secret and shameful ways we do not use deception nor do we distort the word of god on the contrary by setting forth the truth plainly we commend ourselves to every mans conscience in the sight of god and even if our gospel is veiled it is veiled to those who are perishing the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of christ who is the image of god for we do not preach ourselves but jesus christ as lord and ourselves as your servants for jesus sake for god who said let light shine out of darkness made his light shine in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of christ but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us we are hard pressed on every side but not crushed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not abandoned struck down but not destroyed we always carry around in our body the death of jesus so that the life of jesus may also be revealed in our body for we who are alive are always being given over to death for jesus sake so that his life may be revealed in our mortal body so then death is at work in us but life is at work in you it is written i believed therefore i have spoken with that same spirit of faith we also believe and therefore speak because we know that the one who raised the lord jesus from the dead will also raise us with jesus and present us with you in his presence all this is for your benefit so that the grace that is reaching more and more people may cause thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of god therefore we do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal now we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed we have a building from god an eternal house in heaven not built by human hands meanwhile we groan longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling because when we are clothed we will not be found naked for while we are in this tent we groan and are burdened because we do not wish to be unclothed but to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life now it is god who has made us for this very purpose and has given us the spirit as a deposit guaranteeing what is to come therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the lord we live by faith not by sight we are confident i say and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the lord so we make it our goal to please him whether we are at home in the body or away from it for we must all appear before the judgment seat of christ that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body whether good or bad since then we know what it is to fear the lord we try to persuade men what we are is plain to god and i hope it is also plain to your conscience we are not trying to commend ourselves to you again but are giving you an opportunity to take pride in us so that you can answer those who take pride in what is seen rather than in what is in the heart if we are out of our mind it is for the sake of god if we are in our right mind it is for you for christs love compels us because we are convinced that one died for all and therefore all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised again so from now on we regard no one from a worldly point of view though we once regarded christ in this way we do so no longer therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has gone the new has come all this is from god who reconciled us to himself through christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation that god was reconciling the world to himself in christ not counting mens sins against them and he has committed to us the message of reconciliation we are therefore christs ambassadors as though god were making his appeal through us we implore you on christs behalf be reconciled to god god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god as gods fellow workers we urge you not to receive gods grace in vain for he says in the time of my favor i heard you and in the day of salvation i helped you i tell you now is the time of gods favor now is the day of salvation we put no stumbling block in anyones path so that our ministry will not be discredited rather as servants of god we commend ourselves in every way in great endurance in troubles hardships and distresses in beatings imprisonments and riots in hard work sleepless nights and hunger in purity understanding patience and kindness in the holy spirit and in sincere love in truthful speech and in the power of god with weapons of righteousness in the right hand and in the left through glory and dishonor bad report and good report genuine yet regarded as impostors known yet regarded as unknown dying and yet we live on beaten and yet not killed sorrowful yet always rejoicing poor yet making many rich having nothing and yet possessing everything we have spoken freely to you corinthians and opened wide our hearts to you we are not withholding our affection from you but you are withholding yours from us as a fair exchange i speak as to my children open wide your hearts also do not be yoked together with unbelievers for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common or what fellowship can light have with darkness what harmony is there between christ and belial what does a believer have in common with an unbeliever what agreement is there between the temple of god and idols for we are the temple of the living god as god has said i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch no unclean thing and i will receive you i will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god make room for us in your hearts we have wronged no one we have corrupted no one we have exploited no one i do not say this to condemn you i have said before that you have such a place in our hearts that we would live or die with you i have great confidence in you i take great pride in you i am greatly encouraged in all our troubles my joy knows no bounds for when we came into macedonia this body of ours had no rest but we were harassed at every turn conflicts on the outside fears within but god who comforts the downcast comforted us by the coming of titus and not only by his coming but also by the comfort you had given him he told us about your longing for me your deep sorrow your ardent concern for me so that my joy was greater than ever even if i caused you sorrow by my letter i do not regret it though i did regret it i see that my letter hurt you but only for a little while yet now i am happy not because you were made sorry but because your sorrow led you to repentance for you became sorrowful as god intended and so were not harmed in any way by us godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret but worldly sorrow brings death see what this godly sorrow has produced in you what earnestness what eagerness to clear yourselves what indignation what alarm what longing what concern what readiness to see justice done at every point you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter so even though i wrote to you it was not on account of the one who did the wrong or of the injured party but rather that before god you could see for yourselves how devoted to us you are by all this we are encouraged in addition to our own encouragement we were especially delighted to see how happy titus was because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you i had boasted to him about you and you have not embarrassed me but just as everything we said to you was true so our boasting about you to titus has proved to be true as well and his affection for you is all the greater when he remembers that you were all obedient receiving him with fear and trembling i am glad i can have complete confidence in you and now brothers we want you to know about the grace that god has given the macedonian churches out of the most severe trial their overflowing joy and their extreme poverty welled up in rich generosity for i testify that they gave as much as they were able and even beyond their ability entirely on their own they urgently pleaded with us for the privilege of sharing in this service to the saints and they did not do as we expected but they gave themselves first to the lord and then to us in keeping with gods will so we urged titus since he had earlier made a beginning to bring also to completion this act of grace on your part but just as you excel in everything in faith in speech in knowledge in complete earnestness and in your love for us see that you also excel in this grace of giving i am not commanding you but i want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing it with the earnestness of others for you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor so that you through his poverty might become rich and here is my advice about what is best for you in this matter last year you were the first not only to give but also to have the desire to do so now finish the work so that your eager willingness to do it may be matched by your completion of it according to your means for if the willingness is there the gift is acceptable according to what one has not according to what he does not have our desire is not that others might be relieved while you are hard pressed but that there might be equality at the present time your plenty will supply what they need so that in turn their plenty will supply what you need then there will be equality as it is written he who gathered much did not have too much and he who gathered little did not have too little i thank god who put into the heart of titus the same concern i have for you for titus not only welcomed our appeal but he is coming to you with much enthusiasm and on his own initiative and we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his service to the gospel what is more he was chosen by the churches to accompany us as we carry the offering which we administer in order to honor the lord himself and to show our eagerness to help we want to avoid any criticism of the way we administer this liberal gift for we are taking pains to do what is right not only in the eyes of the lord but also in the eyes of men in addition we are sending with them our brother who has often proved to us in many ways that he is zealous and now even more so because of his great confidence in you as for titus he is my partner and fellow worker among you as for our brothers they are representatives of the churches and an honor to christ therefore show these men the proof of your love and the reason for our pride in you so that the churches can see it there is no need for me to write to you about this service to the saints for i know your eagerness to help and i have been boasting about it to the macedonians telling them that since last year you in achaia were ready to give and your enthusiasm has stirred most of them to action but i am sending the brothers in order that our boasting about you in this matter should not prove hollow but that you may be ready as i said you would be for if any macedonians come with me and find you unprepared we not to say anything about you would be ashamed of having been so confident so i thought it necessary to urge the brothers to visit you in advance and finish the arrangements for the generous gift you had promised then it will be ready as a generous gift not as one grudgingly given remember this whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver and god is able to make all grace abound to you so that in all things at all times having all that you need you will abound in every good work as it is written he has scattered abroad his gifts to the poor his righteousness endures forever now he who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will also supply and increase your store of seed and will enlarge the harvest of your righteousness you will be made rich in every way so that you can be generous on every occasion and through us your generosity will result in thanksgiving to god this service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of gods people but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to god because of the service by which you have proved yourselves men will praise god for the obedience that accompanies your confession of the gospel of christ and for your generosity in sharing with them and with everyone else and in their prayers for you their hearts will go out to you because of the surpassing grace god has given you thanks be to god for his indescribable gift by the meekness and gentleness of christ i appeal to you i paul who am timid when face to face with you but bold when away i beg you that when i come i may not have to be as bold as i expect to be toward some people who think that we live by the standards of this world for though we live in the world we do not wage war as the world does the weapons we fight with are not the weapons of the world on the contrary they have divine power to demolish strongholds we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of god and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to christ and we will be ready to punish every act of disobedience once your obedience is complete you are looking only on the surface of things if anyone is confident that he belongs to christ he should consider again that we belong to christ just as much as he for even if i boast somewhat freely about the authority the lord gave us for building you up rather than pulling you down i will not be ashamed of it i do not want to seem to be trying to frighten you with my letters for some say his letters are weighty and forceful but in person he is unimpressive and his speaking amounts to nothing such people should realize that what we are in our letters when we are absent we will be in our actions when we are present we do not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some who commend themselves when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves they are not wise we however will not boast beyond proper limits but will confine our boasting to the field god has assigned to us a field that reaches even to you we are not going too far in our boasting as would be the case if we had not come to you for we did get as far as you with the gospel of christ neither do we go beyond our limits by boasting of work done by others our hope is that as your faith continues to grow our area of activity among you will greatly expand so that we can preach the gospel in the regions beyond you for we do not want to boast about work already done in another mans territory but let him who boasts boast in the lord for it is not the one who commends himself who is approved but the one whom the lord commends i hope you will put up with a little of my foolishness but you are already doing that i am jealous for you with a godly jealousy i promised you to one husband to christ so that i might present you as a pure virgin to him but i am afraid that just as eve was deceived by the serpents cunning your minds may somehow be led astray from your sincere and pure devotion to christ for if someone comes to you and preaches a jesus other than the jesus we preached or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted you put up with it easily enough but i do not think i am in the least inferior to those super apostles i may not be a trained speaker but i do have knowledge we have made this perfectly clear to you in every way was it a sin for me to lower myself in order to elevate you by preaching the gospel of god to you free of charge i robbed other churches by receiving support from them so as to serve you and when i was with you and needed something i was not a burden to anyone for the brothers who came from macedonia supplied what i needed i have kept myself from being a burden to you in any way and will continue to do so as surely as the truth of christ is in me nobody in the regions of achaia will stop this boasting of mine why because i do not love you god knows i do and i will keep on doing what i am doing in order to cut the ground from under those who want an opportunity to be considered equal with us in the things they boast about for such men are false apostles deceitful workmen masquerading as apostles of christ and no wonder for satan himself masquerades as an angel of light it is not surprising then if his servants masquerade as servants of righteousness their end will be what their actions deserve i repeat let no one take me for a fool but if you do then receive me just as you would a fool so that i may do a little boasting in this self confident boasting i am not talking as the lord would but as a fool since many are boasting in the way the world does i too will boast you gladly put up with fools since you are so wise in fact you even put up with anyone who enslaves you or exploits you or takes advantage of you or pushes himself forward or slaps you in the face to my shame i admit that we were too weak for that what anyone else dares to boast about i am speaking as a fool i also dare to boast about are they hebrews so am i are they israelites so am i are they abrahams descendants so am i are they servants of christ i am out of my mind to talk like this i am more i have worked much harder been in prison more frequently been flogged more severely and been exposed to death again and again five times i received from the jews the forty lashes minus one three times i was beaten with rods once i was stoned three times i was shipwrecked i spent a night and a day in the open sea i have been constantly on the move i have been in danger from rivers in danger from bandits in danger from my own countrymen in danger from gentiles in danger in the city in danger in the country in danger at sea and in danger from false brothers i have labored and toiled and have often gone without sleep i have known hunger and thirst and have often gone without food i have been cold and naked besides everything else i face daily the pressure of my concern for all the churches who is weak and i do not feel weak who is led into sin and i do not inwardly burn if i must boast i will boast of the things that show my weakness the god and father of the lord jesus who is to be praised forever knows that i am not lying in damascus the governor under king aretas had the city of the damascenes guarded in order to arrest me but i was lowered in a basket from a window in the wall and slipped through his hands i must go on boasting although there is nothing to be gained i will go on to visions and revelations from the lord i know a man in christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven whether it was in the body or out of the body i do not know god knows and i know that this man whether in the body or apart from the body i do not know but god knows was caught up to paradise he heard inexpressible things things that man is not permitted to tell i will boast about a man like that but i will not boast about myself except about my weaknesses even if i should choose to boast i would not be a fool because i would be speaking the truth but i refrain so no one will think more of me than is warranted by what i do or say to keep me from becoming conceited because of these surpassingly great revelations there was given me a thorn in my flesh a messenger of satan to torment me three times i pleaded with the lord to take it away from me but he said to me my grace is sufficient for you for my power is made perfect in weakness therefore i will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses so that christs power may rest on me that is why for christs sake i delight in weaknesses in insults in hardships in persecutions in difficulties for when i am weak then i am strong i have made a fool of myself but you drove me to it i ought to have been commended by you for i am not in the least inferior to the super apostles even though i am nothing the things that mark an apostle signs wonders and miracles were done among you with great perseverance how were you inferior to the other churches except that i was never a burden to you forgive me this wrong now i am ready to visit you for the third time and i will not be a burden to you because what i want is not your possessions but you after all children should not have to save up for their parents but parents for their children so i will very gladly spend for you everything i have and expend myself as well if i love you more will you love me less be that as it may i have not been a burden to you yet crafty fellow that i am i caught you by trickery did i exploit you through any of the men i sent you i urged titus to go to you and i sent our brother with him titus did not exploit you did he did we not act in the same spirit and follow the same course have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you we have been speaking in the sight of god as those in christ and everything we do dear friends is for your strengthening for i am afraid that when i come i may not find you as i want you to be and you may not find me as you want me to be i fear that there may be quarreling jealousy outbursts of anger factions slander gossip arrogance and disorder i am afraid that when i come again my god will humble me before you and i will be grieved over many who have sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity sexual sin and debauchery in which they have indulged this will be my third visit to you every matter must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses i already gave you a warning when i was with you the second time i now repeat it while absent on my return i will not spare those who sinned earlier or any of the others since you are demanding proof that christ is speaking through me he is not weak in dealing with you but is powerful among you for to be sure he was crucified in weakness yet he lives by gods power likewise we are weak in him yet by gods power we will live with him to serve you examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith test yourselves do you not realize that christ jesus is in you unless of course you fail the test and i trust that you will discover that we have not failed the test now we pray to god that you will not do anything wrong not that people will see that we have stood the test but that you will do what is right even though we may seem to have failed for we cannot do anything against the truth but only for the truth we are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong and our prayer is for your perfection this is why i write these things when i am absent that when i come i may not have to be harsh in my use of authority the authority the lord gave me for building you up not for tearing you down finally brothers good by aim for perfection listen to my appeal be of one mind live in peace and the god of love and peace will be with you greet one another with a holy kiss all the saints send their greetings may the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the fellowship of the holy spirit be with you all  paul an apostle sent not from men nor by man but by jesus christ and god the father who raised him from the dead and all the brothers with me to the churches in galatia grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ who gave himself for our sins to rescue us from the present evil age according to the will of our god and father to whom be glory for ever and ever amen i am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of christ and are turning to a different gospel which is really no gospel at all evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of christ but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let him be eternally condemned as we have already said so now i say again if anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted let him be eternally condemned am i now trying to win the approval of men or of god or am i trying to please men if i were still trying to please men i would not be a servant of christ i want you to know brothers that the gospel i preached is not something that man made up i did not receive it from any man nor was i taught it rather i received it by revelation from jesus christ for you have heard of my previous way of life in judaism how intensely i persecuted the church of god and tried to destroy it i was advancing in judaism beyond many jews of my own age and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my fathers but when god who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased to reveal his son in me so that i might preach him among the gentiles i did not consult any man nor did i go up to jerusalem to see those who were apostles before i was but i went immediately into arabia and later returned to damascus then after three years i went up to jerusalem to get acquainted with peter and stayed with him fifteen days i saw none of the other apostles only james the lords brother i assure you before god that what i am writing you is no lie later i went to syria and cilicia i was personally unknown to the churches of judea that are in christ they only heard the report the man who formerly persecuted us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy and they praised god because of me fourteen years later i went up again to jerusalem this time with barnabas i took titus along also i went in response to a revelation and set before them the gospel that i preach among the gentiles but i did this privately to those who seemed to be leaders for fear that i was running or had run my race in vain yet not even titus who was with me was compelled to be circumcised even though he was a greek this matter arose because some false brothers had infiltrated our ranks to spy on the freedom we have in christ jesus and to make us slaves we did not give in to them for a moment so that the truth of the gospel might remain with you as for those who seemed to be important whatever they were makes no difference to me god does not judge by external appearance those men added nothing to my message on the contrary they saw that i had been entrusted with the task of preaching the gospel to the gentiles just as peter had been to the jews for god who was at work in the ministry of peter as an apostle to the jews was also at work in my ministry as an apostle to the gentiles james peter and john those reputed to be pillars gave me and barnabas the right hand of fellowship when they recognized the grace given to me they agreed that we should go to the gentiles and they to the jews all they asked was that we should continue to remember the poor the very thing i was eager to do when peter came to antioch i opposed him to his face because he was clearly in the wrong before certain men came from james he used to eat with the gentiles but when they arrived he began to draw back and separate himself from the gentiles because he was afraid of those who belonged to the circumcision group the other jews joined him in his hypocrisy so that by their hypocrisy even barnabas was led astray when i saw that they were not acting in line with the truth of the gospel i said to peter in front of them all you are a jew yet you live like a gentile and not like a jew how is it then that you force gentiles to follow jewish customs we who are jews by birth and not gentile sinners know that a man is not justified by observing the law but by faith in jesus christ so we too have put our faith in christ jesus that we may be justified by faith in christ and not by observing the law because by observing the law no one will be justified if while we seek to be justified in christ it becomes evident that we ourselves are sinners does that mean that christ promotes sin absolutely not if i rebuild what i destroyed i prove that i am a lawbreaker for through the law i died to the law so that i might live for god i have been crucified with christ and i no longer live but christ lives in me the life i live in the body i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me i do not set aside the grace of god for if righteousness could be gained through the law christ died for nothing you foolish galatians who has bewitched you before your very eyes jesus christ was clearly portrayed as crucified i would like to learn just one thing from you did you receive the spirit by observing the law or by believing what you heard are you so foolish after beginning with the spirit are you now trying to attain your goal by human effort have you suffered so much for nothing if it really was for nothing does god give you his spirit and work miracles among you because you observe the law or because you believe what you heard consider abraham he believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness understand then that those who believe are children of abraham the scripture foresaw that god would justify the gentiles by faith and announced the gospel in advance to abraham all nations will be blessed through you so those who have faith are blessed along with abraham the man of faith all who rely on observing the law are under a curse for it is written cursed is everyone who does not continue to do everything written in the book of the law clearly no one is justified before god by the law because the righteous will live by faith the law is not based on faith on the contrary the man who does these things will live by them christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us for it is written cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree he redeemed us in order that the blessing given to abraham might come to the gentiles through christ jesus so that by faith we might receive the promise of the spirit brothers let me take an example from everyday life just as no one can set aside or add to a human covenant that has been duly established so it is in this case the promises were spoken to abraham and to his seed the scripture does not say and to seeds meaning many people but and to your seed meaning one person who is christ what i mean is this the law introduced 430 years later does not set aside the covenant previously established by god and thus do away with the promise for if the inheritance depends on the law then it no longer depends on a promise but god in his grace gave it to abraham through a promise what then was the purpose of the law it was added because of transgressions until the seed to whom the promise referred had come the law was put into effect through angels by a mediator a mediator however does not represent just one party but god is one is the law therefore opposed to the promises of god absolutely not for if a law had been given that could impart life then righteousness would certainly have come by the law but the scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin so that what was promised being given through faith in jesus christ might be given to those who believe before this faith came we were held prisoners by the law locked up until faith should be revealed so the law was put in charge to lead us to christ that we might be justified by faith now that faith has come we are no longer under the supervision of the law you are all sons of god through faith in christ jesus for all of you who were baptized into christ have clothed yourselves with christ there is neither jew nor greek slave nor free male nor female for you are all one in christ jesus if you belong to christ then you are abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise what i am saying is that as long as the heir is a child he is no different from a slave although he owns the whole estate he is subject to guardians and trustees until the time set by his father so also when we were children we were in slavery under the basic principles of the world but when the time had fully come god sent his son born of a woman born under law to redeem those under law that we might receive the full rights of sons because you are sons god sent the spirit of his son into our hearts the spirit who calls out abba father so you are no longer a slave but a son and since you are a son god has made you also an heir formerly when you did not know god you were slaves to those who by nature are not gods but now that you know god or rather are known by god how is it that you are turning back to those weak and miserable principles do you wish to be enslaved by them all over again you are observing special days and months and seasons and years i fear for you that somehow i have wasted my efforts on you i plead with you brothers become like me for i became like you you have done me no wrong as you know it was because of an illness that i first preached the gospel to you even though my illness was a trial to you you did not treat me with contempt or scorn instead you welcomed me as if i were an angel of god as if i were christ jesus himself what has happened to all your joy i can testify that if you could have done so you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me have i now become your enemy by telling you the truth those people are zealous to win you over but for no good what they want is to alienate you from us so that you may be zealous for them it is fine to be zealous provided the purpose is good and to be so always and not just when i am with you my dear children for whom i am again in the pains of childbirth until christ is formed in you how i wish i could be with you now and change my tone because i am perplexed about you tell me you who want to be under the law are you not aware of what the law says for it is written that abraham had two sons one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman his son by the slave woman was born in the ordinary way but his son by the free woman was born as the result of a promise these things may be taken figuratively for the women represent two covenants one covenant is from mount sinai and bears children who are to be slaves this is hagar now hagar stands for mount sinai in arabia and corresponds to the present city of jerusalem because she is in slavery with her children but the jerusalem that is above is free and she is our mother for it is written be glad o barren woman who bears no children break forth and cry aloud you who have no labor pains because more are the children of the desolate woman than of her who has a husband now you brothers like isaac are children of promise at that time the son born in the ordinary way persecuted the son born by the power of the spirit it is the same now but what does the scripture say get rid of the slave woman and her son for the slave womans son will never share in the inheritance with the free womans son therefore brothers we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman it is for freedom that christ has set us free stand firm then and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery mark my words i paul tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised christ will be of no value to you at all again i declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law you who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from christ you have fallen away from grace but by faith we eagerly await through the spirit the righteousness for which we hope for in christ jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision has any value the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love you were running a good race who cut in on you and kept you from obeying the truth that kind of persuasion does not come from the one who calls you a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough i am confident in the lord that you will take no other view the one who is throwing you into confusion will pay the penalty whoever he may be brothers if i am still preaching circumcision why am i still being persecuted in that case the offense of the cross has been abolished as for those agitators i wish they would go the whole way and emasculate themselves you my brothers were called to be free but do not use your freedom to indulge the sinful nature rather serve one another in love the entire law is summed up in a single command love your neighbor as yourself if you keep on biting and devouring each other watch out or you will be destroyed by each other so i say live by the spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature for the sinful nature desires what is contrary to the spirit and the spirit what is contrary to the sinful nature they are in conflict with each other so that you do not do what you want but if you are led by the spirit you are not under law the acts of the sinful nature are obvious sexual immorality impurity and debauchery idolatry and witchcraft hatred discord jealousy fits of rage selfish ambition dissensions factions and envy drunkenness orgies and the like i warn you as i did before that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of god but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and self control against such things there is no law those who belong to christ jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires since we live by the spirit let us keep in step with the spirit let us not become conceited provoking and envying each other brothers if someone is caught in a sin you who are spiritual should restore him gently but watch yourself or you also may be tempted carry each others burdens and in this way you will fulfill the law of christ if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself each one should test his own actions then he can take pride in himself without comparing himself to somebody else for each one should carry his own load anyone who receives instruction in the word must share all good things with his instructor do not be deceived god cannot be mocked a man reaps what he sows the one who sows to please his sinful nature from that nature will reap destruction the one who sows to please the spirit from the spirit will reap eternal life let us not become weary in doing good for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all people especially to those who belong to the family of believers see what large letters i use as i write to you with my own hand those who want to make a good impression outwardly are trying to compel you to be circumcised the only reason they do this is to avoid being persecuted for the cross of christ not even those who are circumcised obey the law yet they want you to be circumcised that they may boast about your flesh may i never boast except in the cross of our lord jesus christ through which the world has been crucified to me and i to the world neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything what counts is a new creation peace and mercy to all who follow this rule even to the israel of god finally let no one cause me trouble for i bear on my body the marks of jesus the grace of our lord jesus christ be with your spirit brothers amen  paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god to the saints in ephesus the faithful in christ jesus grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us in the heavenly realms with every spiritual blessing in christ for he chose us in him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless in his sight in love he predestined us to be adopted as his sons through jesus christ in accordance with his pleasure and will to the praise of his glorious grace which he has freely given us in the one he loves in him we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins in accordance with the riches of gods grace that he lavished on us with all wisdom and understanding and he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in christ to be put into effect when the times will have reached their fulfillment to bring all things in heaven and on earth together under one head even christ in him we were also chosen having been predestined according to the plan of him who works out everything in conformity with the purpose of his will in order that we who were the first to hope in christ might be for the praise of his glory and you also were included in christ when you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation having believed you were marked in him with a seal the promised holy spirit who is a deposit guaranteeing our inheritance until the redemption of those who are gods possession to the praise of his glory for this reason ever since i heard about your faith in the lord jesus and your love for all the saints i have not stopped giving thanks for you remembering you in my prayers i keep asking that the god of our lord jesus christ the glorious father may give you the spirit of wisdom and revelation so that you may know him better i pray also that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened in order that you may know the hope to which he has called you the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints and his incomparably great power for us who believe that power is like the working of his mighty strength which he exerted in christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms far above all rule and authority power and dominion and every title that can be given not only in the present age but also in the one to come and god placed all things under his feet and appointed him to be head over everything for the church which is his body the fullness of him who fills everything in every way as for you you were dead in your transgressions and sins in which you used to live when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air the spirit who is now at work in those who are disobedient all of us also lived among them at one time gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts like the rest we were by nature objects of wrath but because of his great love for us god who is rich in mercy made us alive with christ even when we were dead in transgressions it is by grace you have been saved and god raised us up with christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in christ jesus in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace expressed in his kindness to us in christ jesus for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do therefore remember that formerly you who are gentiles by birth and called uncircumcised by those who call themselves the circumcision that done in the body by the hands of men remember that at that time you were separate from christ excluded from citizenship in israel and foreigners to the covenants of the promise without hope and without god in the world but now in christ jesus you who once were far away have been brought near through the blood of christ for he himself is our peace who has made the two one and has destroyed the barrier the dividing wall of hostility by abolishing in his flesh the law with its commandments and regulations his purpose was to create in himself one new man out of the two thus making peace and in this one body to reconcile both of them to god through the cross by which he put to death their hostility he came and preached peace to you who were far away and peace to those who were near for through him we both have access to the father by one spirit consequently you are no longer foreigners and aliens but fellow citizens with gods people and members of gods household built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets with christ jesus himself as the chief cornerstone in him the whole building is joined together and rises to become a holy temple in the lord and in him you too are being built together to become a dwelling in which god lives by his spirit for this reason i paul the prisoner of christ jesus for the sake of you gentiles surely you have heard about the administration of gods grace that was given to me for you that is the mystery made known to me by revelation as i have already written briefly in reading this then you will be able to understand my insight into the mystery of christ which was not made known to men in other generations as it has now been revealed by the spirit to gods holy apostles and prophets this mystery is that through the gospel the gentiles are heirs together with israel members together of one body and sharers together in the promise in christ jesus i became a servant of this gospel by the gift of gods grace given me through the working of his power although i am less than the least of all gods people this grace was given me to preach to the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make plain to everyone the administration of this mystery which for ages past was kept hidden in god who created all things his intent was that now through the church the manifold wisdom of god should be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realms according to his eternal purpose which he accomplished in christ jesus our lord in him and through faith in him we may approach god with freedom and confidence i ask you therefore not to be discouraged because of my sufferings for you which are your glory for this reason i kneel before the father from whom his whole family in heaven and on earth derives its name i pray that out of his glorious riches he may strengthen you with power through his spirit in your inner being so that christ may dwell in your hearts through faith and i pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the saints to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of christ and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of god now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine according to his power that is at work within us to him be glory in the church and in christ jesus throughout all generations for ever and ever amen as a prisoner for the lord then i urge you to live a life worthy of the calling you have received be completely humble and gentle be patient bearing with one another in love make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace there is one body and one spirit just as you were called to one hope when you were called one lord one faith one baptism one god and father of all who is over all and through all and in all but to each one of us grace has been given as christ apportioned it this is why it says when he ascended on high he led captives in his train and gave gifts to men what does he ascended mean except that he also descended to the lower earthly regions he who descended is the very one who ascended higher than all the heavens in order to fill the whole universe it was he who gave some to be apostles some to be prophets some to be evangelists and some to be pastors and teachers to prepare gods people for works of service so that the body of christ may be built up until we all reach unity in the faith and in the knowledge of the son of god and become mature attaining to the whole measure of the fullness of christ then we will no longer be infants tossed back and forth by the waves and blown here and there by every wind of teaching and by the cunning and craftiness of men in their deceitful scheming instead speaking the truth in love we will in all things grow up into him who is the head that is christ from him the whole body joined and held together by every supporting ligament grows and builds itself up in love as each part does its work so i tell you this and insist on it in the lord that you must no longer live as the gentiles do in the futility of their thinking they are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of god because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts having lost all sensitivity they have given themselves over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity with a continual lust for more you however did not come to know christ that way surely you heard of him and were taught in him in accordance with the truth that is in jesus you were taught with regard to your former way of life to put off your old self which is being corrupted by its deceitful desires to be made new in the attitude of your minds and to put on the new self created to be like god in true righteousness and holiness therefore each of you must put off falsehood and speak truthfully to his neighbor for we are all members of one body in your anger do not sin do not let the sun go down while you are still angry and do not give the devil a foothold he who has been stealing must steal no longer but must work doing something useful with his own hands that he may have something to share with those in need do not let any unwholesome talk come out of your mouths but only what is helpful for building others up according to their needs that it may benefit those who listen and do not grieve the holy spirit of god with whom you were sealed for the day of redemption get rid of all bitterness rage and anger brawling and slander along with every form of malice be kind and compassionate to one another forgiving each other just as in christ god forgave you be imitators of god therefore as dearly loved children and live a life of love just as christ loved us and gave himself up for us as a fragrant offering and sacrifice to god but among you there must not be even a hint of sexual immorality or of any kind of impurity or of greed because these are improper for gods holy people nor should there be obscenity foolish talk or coarse joking which are out of place but rather thanksgiving for of this you can be sure no immoral impure or greedy person such a man is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and of god let no one deceive you with empty words for because of such things gods wrath comes on those who are disobedient therefore do not be partners with them for you were once darkness but now you are light in the lord live as children of light for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness righteousness and truth and find out what pleases the lord have nothing to do with the fruitless deeds of darkness but rather expose them for it is shameful even to mention what the disobedient do in secret but everything exposed by the light becomes visible for it is light that makes everything visible this is why it is said wake up o sleeper rise from the dead and christ will shine on you be very careful then how you live not as unwise but as wise making the most of every opportunity because the days are evil therefore do not be foolish but understand what the lords will is do not get drunk on wine which leads to debauchery instead be filled with the spirit speak to one another with psalms hymns and spiritual songs sing and make music in your heart to the lord always giving thanks to god the father for everything in the name of our lord jesus christ submit to one another out of reverence for christ wives submit to your husbands as to the lord for the husband is the head of the wife as christ is the head of the church his body of which he is the savior now as the church submits to christ so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her to make her holy cleansing her by the washing with water through the word and to present her to himself as a radiant church without stain or wrinkle or any other blemish but holy and blameless in this same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies he who loves his wife loves himself after all no one ever hated his own body but he feeds and cares for it just as christ does the church for we are members of his body for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh this is a profound mystery but i am talking about christ and the church however each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself and the wife must respect her husband children obey your parents in the lord for this is right honor your father and mother which is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you may enjoy long life on the earth fathers do not exasperate your children instead bring them up in the training and instruction of the lord slaves obey your earthly masters with respect and fear and with sincerity of heart just as you would obey christ obey them not only to win their favor when their eye is on you but like slaves of christ doing the will of god from your heart serve wholeheartedly as if you were serving the lord not men because you know that the lord will reward everyone for whatever good he does whether he is slave or free and masters treat your slaves in the same way do not threaten them since you know that he who is both their master and yours is in heaven and there is no favoritism with him finally be strong in the lord and in his mighty power put on the full armor of god so that you can take your stand against the devils schemes for our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the authorities against the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly realms therefore put on the full armor of god so that when the day of evil comes you may be able to stand your ground and after you have done everything to stand stand firm then with the belt of truth buckled around your waist with the breastplate of righteousness in place and with your feet fitted with the readiness that comes from the gospel of peace in addition to all this take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of god and pray in the spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests with this in mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints pray also for me that whenever i open my mouth words may be given me so that i will fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel for which i am an ambassador in chains pray that i may declare it fearlessly as i should tychicus the dear brother and faithful servant in the lord will tell you everything so that you also may know how i am and what i am doing i am sending him to you for this very purpose that you may know how we are and that he may encourage you peace to the brothers and love with faith from god the father and the lord jesus christ grace to all who love our lord jesus christ with an undying love  paul and timothy servants of christ jesus to all the saints in christ jesus at philippi together with the overseers and deacons grace and peace to you from god our father and the lord jesus christ i thank my god every time i remember you in all my prayers for all of you i always pray with joy because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now being confident of this that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of christ jesus it is right for me to feel this way about all of you since i have you in my heart for whether i am in chains or defending and confirming the gospel all of you share in gods grace with me god can testify how i long for all of you with the affection of christ jesus and this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in knowledge and depth of insight so that you may be able to discern what is best and may be pure and blameless until the day of christ filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through jesus christ to the glory and praise of god now i want you to know brothers that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel as a result it has become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that i am in chains for christ because of my chains most of the brothers in the lord have been encouraged to speak the word of god more courageously and fearlessly it is true that some preach christ out of envy and rivalry but others out of goodwill the latter do so in love knowing that i am put here for the defense of the gospel the former preach christ out of selfish ambition not sincerely supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while i am in chains but what does it matter the important thing is that in every way whether from false motives or true christ is preached and because of this i rejoice yes and i will continue to rejoice for i know that through your prayers and the help given by the spirit of jesus christ what has happened to me will turn out for my deliverance i eagerly expect and hope that i will in no way be ashamed but will have sufficient courage so that now as always christ will be exalted in my body whether by life or by death for to me to live is christ and to die is gain if i am to go on living in the body this will mean fruitful labor for me yet what shall i choose i do not know i am torn between the two i desire to depart and be with christ which is better by far but it is more necessary for you that i remain in the body convinced of this i know that i will remain and i will continue with all of you for your progress and joy in the faith so that through my being with you again your joy in christ jesus will overflow on account of me whatever happens conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of christ then whether i come and see you or only hear about you in my absence i will know that you stand firm in one spirit contending as one man for the faith of the gospel without being frightened in any way by those who oppose you this is a sign to them that they will be destroyed but that you will be saved and that by god for it has been granted to you on behalf of christ not only to believe on him but also to suffer for him since you are going through the same struggle you saw i had and now hear that i still have if you have any encouragement from being united with christ if any comfort from his love if any fellowship with the spirit if any tenderness and compassion then make my joy complete by being like minded having the same love being one in spirit and purpose do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit but in humility consider others better than yourselves each of you should look not only to your own interests but also to the interests of others your attitude should be the same as that of christ jesus who being in very nature god did not consider equality with god something to be grasped but made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness and being found in appearance as a man he humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on a cross therefore god exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father therefore my dear friends as you have always obeyed not only in my presence but now much more in my absence continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling for it is god who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose do everything without complaining or arguing so that you may become blameless and pure children of god without fault in a crooked and depraved generation in which you shine like stars in the universe as you hold out the word of life in order that i may boast on the day of christ that i did not run or labor for nothing but even if i am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service coming from your faith i am glad and rejoice with all of you so you too should be glad and rejoice with me i hope in the lord jesus to send timothy to you soon that i also may be cheered when i receive news about you i have no one else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare for everyone looks out for his own interests not those of jesus christ but you know that timothy has proved himself because as a son with his father he has served with me in the work of the gospel i hope therefore to send him as soon as i see how things go with me and i am confident in the lord that i myself will come soon but i think it is necessary to send back to you epaphroditus my brother fellow worker and fellow soldier who is also your messenger whom you sent to take care of my needs for he longs for all of you and is distressed because you heard he was ill indeed he was ill and almost died but god had mercy on him and not on him only but also on me to spare me sorrow upon sorrow therefore i am all the more eager to send him so that when you see him again you may be glad and i may have less anxiety welcome him in the lord with great joy and honor men like him because he almost died for the work of christ risking his life to make up for the help you could not give me finally my brothers rejoice in the lord it is no trouble for me to write the same things to you again and it is a safeguard for you watch out for those dogs those men who do evil those mutilators of the flesh for it is we who are the circumcision we who worship by the spirit of god who glory in christ jesus and who put no confidence in the flesh though i myself have reasons for such confidence if anyone else thinks he has reasons to put confidence in the flesh i have more circumcised on the eighth day of the people of israel of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of hebrews in regard to the law a pharisee as for zeal persecuting the church as for legalistic righteousness faultless but whatever was to my profit i now consider loss for the sake of christ what is more i consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing christ jesus my lord for whose sake i have lost all things i consider them rubbish that i may gain christ and be found in him not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law but that which is through faith in christ the righteousness that comes from god and is by faith i want to know christ and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings becoming like him in his death and so somehow to attain to the resurrection from the dead not that i have already obtained all this or have already been made perfect but i press on to take hold of that for which christ jesus took hold of me brothers i do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it but one thing i do forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead i press on toward the goal to win the prize for which god has called me heavenward in christ jesus all of us who are mature should take such a view of things and if on some point you think differently that too god will make clear to you only let us live up to what we have already attained join with others in following my example brothers and take note of those who live according to the pattern we gave you for as i have often told you before and now say again even with tears many live as enemies of the cross of christ their destiny is destruction their god is their stomach and their glory is in their shame their mind is on earthly things but our citizenship is in heaven and we eagerly await a savior from there the lord jesus christ who by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body therefore my brothers you whom i love and long for my joy and crown that is how you should stand firm in the lord dear friends i plead with euodia and i plead with syntyche to agree with each other in the lord yes and i ask you loyal yokefellow help these women who have contended at my side in the cause of the gospel along with clement and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life rejoice in the lord always i will say it again rejoice let your gentleness be evident to all the lord is near do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition with thanksgiving present your requests to god and the peace of god which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in christ jesus finally brothers whatever is true whatever is noble whatever is right whatever is pure whatever is lovely whatever is admirable if anything is excellent or praiseworthy think about such things whatever you have learned or received or heard from me or seen in me put it into practice and the god of peace will be with you i rejoice greatly in the lord that at last you have renewed your concern for me indeed you have been concerned but you had no opportunity to show it i am not saying this because i am in need for i have learned to be content whatever the circumstances i know what it is to be in need and i know what it is to have plenty i have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation whether well fed or hungry whether living in plenty or in want i can do everything through him who gives me strength yet it was good of you to share in my troubles moreover as you philippians know in the early days of your acquaintance with the gospel when i set out from macedonia not one church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only for even when i was in thessalonica you sent me aid again and again when i was in need not that i am looking for a gift but i am looking for what may be credited to your account i have received full payment and even more i am amply supplied now that i have received from epaphroditus the gifts you sent they are a fragrant offering an acceptable sacrifice pleasing to god and my god will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in christ jesus to our god and father be glory for ever and ever amen greet all the saints in christ jesus the brothers who are with me send greetings all the saints send you greetings especially those who belong to caesars household the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit amen  paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god and timothy our brother to the holy and faithful brothers in christ at colosse grace and peace to you from god our father we always thank god the father of our lord jesus christ when we pray for you because we have heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love you have for all the saints the faith and love that spring from the hope that is stored up for you in heaven and that you have already heard about in the word of truth the gospel that has come to you all over the world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing just as it has been doing among you since the day you heard it and understood gods grace in all its truth you learned it from epaphras our dear fellow servant who is a faithful minister of christ on our behalf and who also told us of your love in the spirit for this reason since the day we heard about you we have not stopped praying for you and asking god to fill you with the knowledge of his will through all spiritual wisdom and understanding and we pray this in order that you may live a life worthy of the lord and may please him in every way bearing fruit in every good work growing in the knowledge of god being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might so that you may have great endurance and patience and joyfully giving thanks to the father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in the kingdom of light for he has rescued us from the dominion of darkness and brought us into the kingdom of the son he loves in whom we have redemption the forgiveness of sins he is the image of the invisible god the firstborn over all creation for by him all things were created things in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities all things were created by him and for him he is before all things and in him all things hold together and he is the head of the body the church he is the beginning and the firstborn from among the dead so that in everything he might have the supremacy for god was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him and through him to reconcile to himself all things whether things on earth or things in heaven by making peace through his blood shed on the cross once you were alienated from god and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior but now he has reconciled you by christs physical body through death to present you holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation if you continue in your faith established and firm not moved from the hope held out in the gospel this is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which i paul have become a servant now i rejoice in what was suffered for you and i fill up in my flesh what is still lacking in regard to christs afflictions for the sake of his body which is the church i have become its servant by the commission god gave me to present to you the word of god in its fullness the mystery that has been kept hidden for ages and generations but is now disclosed to the saints to them god has chosen to make known among the gentiles the glorious riches of this mystery which is christ in you the hope of glory we proclaim him admonishing and teaching everyone with all wisdom so that we may present everyone perfect in christ to this end i labor struggling with all his energy which so powerfully works in me i want you to know how much i am struggling for you and for those at laodicea and for all who have not met me personally my purpose is that they may be encouraged in heart and united in love so that they may have the full riches of complete understanding in order that they may know the mystery of god namely christ in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge i tell you this so that no one may deceive you by fine sounding arguments for though i am absent from you in body i am present with you in spirit and delight to see how orderly you are and how firm your faith in christ is so then just as you received christ jesus as lord continue to live in him rooted and built up in him strengthened in the faith as you were taught and overflowing with thankfulness see to it that no one takes you captive through hollow and deceptive philosophy which depends on human tradition and the basic principles of this world rather than on christ for in christ all the fullness of the deity lives in bodily form and you have been given fullness in christ who is the head over every power and authority in him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with the circumcision done by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead when you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature god made you alive with christ he forgave us all our sins having canceled the written code with its regulations that was against us and that stood opposed to us he took it away nailing it to the cross and having disarmed the powers and authorities he made a public spectacle of them triumphing over them by the cross therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink or with regard to a religious festival a new moon celebration or a sabbath day these are a shadow of the things that were to come the reality however is found in christ do not let anyone who delights in false humility and the worship of angels disqualify you for the prize such a person goes into great detail about what he has seen and his unspiritual mind puffs him up with idle notions he has lost connection with the head from whom the whole body supported and held together by its ligaments and sinews grows as god causes it to grow since you died with christ to the basic principles of this world why as though you still belonged to it do you submit to its rules do not handle do not taste do not touch these are all destined to perish with use because they are based on human commands and teachings such regulations indeed have an appearance of wisdom with their self imposed worship their false humility and their harsh treatment of the body but they lack any value in restraining sensual indulgence since then you have been raised with christ set your hearts on things above where christ is seated at the right hand of god set your minds on things above not on earthly things for you died and your life is now hidden with christ in god when christ who is your life appears then you also will appear with him in glory put to death therefore whatever belongs to your earthly nature sexual immorality impurity lust evil desires and greed which is idolatry because of these the wrath of god is coming you used to walk in these ways in the life you once lived but now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these anger rage malice slander and filthy language from your lips do not lie to each other since you have taken off your old self with its practices and have put on the new self which is being renewed in knowledge in the image of its creator here there is no greek or jew circumcised or uncircumcised barbarian scythian slave or free but christ is all and is in all therefore as gods chosen people holy and dearly loved clothe yourselves with compassion kindness humility gentleness and patience bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another forgive as the lord forgave you and over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity let the peace of christ rule in your hearts since as members of one body you were called to peace and be thankful let the word of christ dwell in you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom and as you sing psalms hymns and spiritual songs with gratitude in your hearts to god and whatever you do whether in word or deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus giving thanks to god the father through him wives submit to your husbands as is fitting in the lord husbands love your wives and do not be harsh with them children obey your parents in everything for this pleases the lord fathers do not embitter your children or they will become discouraged slaves obey your earthly masters in everything and do it not only when their eye is on you and to win their favor but with sincerity of heart and reverence for the lord whatever you do work at it with all your heart as working for the lord not for men since you know that you will receive an inheritance from the lord as a reward it is the lord christ you are serving anyone who does wrong will be repaid for his wrong and there is no favoritism masters provide your slaves with what is right and fair because you know that you also have a master in heaven devote yourselves to prayer being watchful and thankful and pray for us too that god may open a door for our message so that we may proclaim the mystery of christ for which i am in chains pray that i may proclaim it clearly as i should be wise in the way you act toward outsiders make the most of every opportunity let your conversation be always full of grace seasoned with salt so that you may know how to answer everyone tychicus will tell you all the news about me he is a dear brother a faithful minister and fellow servant in the lord i am sending him to you for the express purpose that you may know about our circumstances and that he may encourage your hearts he is coming with onesimus our faithful and dear brother who is one of you they will tell you everything that is happening here my fellow prisoner aristarchus sends you his greetings as does mark the cousin of barnabas you have received instructions about him if he comes to you welcome him jesus who is called justus also sends greetings these are the only jews among my fellow workers for the kingdom of god and they have proved a comfort to me epaphras who is one of you and a servant of christ jesus sends greetings he is always wrestling in prayer for you that you may stand firm in all the will of god mature and fully assured i vouch for him that he is working hard for you and for those at laodicea and hierapolis our dear friend luke the doctor and demas send greetings give my greetings to the brothers at laodicea and to nympha and the church in her house after this letter has been read to you see that it is also read in the church of the laodiceans and that you in turn read the letter from laodicea tell archippus see to it that you complete the work you have received in the lord i paul write this greeting in my own hand remember my chains grace be with you  paul silas and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god the father and the lord jesus christ grace and peace to you we always thank god for all of you mentioning you in our prayers we continually remember before our god and father your work produced by faith your labor prompted by love and your endurance inspired by hope in our lord jesus christ for we know brothers loved by god that he has chosen you because our gospel came to you not simply with words but also with power with the holy spirit and with deep conviction you know how we lived among you for your sake you became imitators of us and of the lord in spite of severe suffering you welcomed the message with the joy given by the holy spirit and so you became a model to all the believers in macedonia and achaia the lords message rang out from you not only in macedonia and achaia your faith in god has become known everywhere therefore we do not need to say anything about it for they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us they tell how you turned to god from idols to serve the living and true god and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead jesus who rescues us from the coming wrath you know brothers that our visit to you was not a failure we had previously suffered and been insulted in philippi as you know but with the help of our god we dared to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition for the appeal we make does not spring from error or impure motives nor are we trying to trick you on the contrary we speak as men approved by god to be entrusted with the gospel we are not trying to please men but god who tests our hearts you know we never used flattery nor did we put on a mask to cover up greed god is our witness we were not looking for praise from men not from you or anyone else as apostles of christ we could have been a burden to you but we were gentle among you like a mother caring for her little children we loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not only the gospel of god but our lives as well because you had become so dear to us surely you remember brothers our toil and hardship we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to anyone while we preached the gospel of god to you you are witnesses and so is god of how holy righteous and blameless we were among you who believed for you know that we dealt with each of you as a father deals with his own children encouraging comforting and urging you to live lives worthy of god who calls you into his kingdom and glory and we also thank god continually because when you received the word of god which you heard from us you accepted it not as the word of men but as it actually is the word of god which is at work in you who believe for you brothers became imitators of gods churches in judea which are in christ jesus you suffered from your own countrymen the same things those churches suffered from the jews who killed the lord jesus and the prophets and also drove us out they displease god and are hostile to all men in their effort to keep us from speaking to the gentiles so that they may be saved in this way they always heap up their sins to the limit the wrath of god has come upon them at last but brothers when we were torn away from you for a short time in person not in thought out of our intense longing we made every effort to see you for we wanted to come to you certainly i paul did again and again but satan stopped us for what is our hope our joy or the crown in which we will glory in the presence of our lord jesus when he comes is it not you indeed you are our glory and joy so when we could stand it no longer we thought it best to be left by ourselves in athens we sent timothy who is our brother and gods fellow worker in spreading the gospel of christ to strengthen and encourage you in your faith so that no one would be unsettled by these trials you know quite well that we were destined for them in fact when we were with you we kept telling you that we would be persecuted and it turned out that way as you well know for this reason when i could stand it no longer i sent timothy to find out about your faith i was afraid that in some way the tempter might have tempted you and our efforts might have been useless but timothy has just now come to us from you and has brought good news about your faith and love he has told us that you always have pleasant memories of us and that you long to see us just as we also long to see you therefore brothers in all our distress and persecution we were encouraged about you because of your faith for now we really live since you are standing firm in the lord how can we thank god enough for you in return for all the joy we have in the presence of our god because of you night and day we pray most earnestly that we may see you again and supply what is lacking in your faith now may our god and father himself and our lord jesus clear the way for us to come to you may the lord make your love increase and overflow for each other and for everyone else just as ours does for you may he strengthen your hearts so that you will be blameless and holy in the presence of our god and father when our lord jesus comes with all his holy ones finally brothers we instructed you how to live in order to please god as in fact you are living now we ask you and urge you in the lord jesus to do this more and more for you know what instructions we gave you by the authority of the lord jesus it is gods will that you should be sanctified that you should avoid sexual immorality that each of you should learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable not in passionate lust like the heathen who do not know god and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him the lord will punish men for all such sins as we have already told you and warned you for god did not call us to be impure but to live a holy life therefore he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but god who gives you his holy spirit now about brotherly love we do not need to write to you for you yourselves have been taught by god to love each other and in fact you do love all the brothers throughout macedonia yet we urge you brothers to do so more and more make it your ambition to lead a quiet life to mind your own business and to work with your hands just as we told you so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders and so that you will not be dependent on anybody brothers we do not want you to be ignorant about those who fall asleep or to grieve like the rest of men who have no hope we believe that jesus died and rose again and so we believe that god will bring with jesus those who have fallen asleep in him according to the lords own word we tell you that we who are still alive who are left till the coming of the lord will certainly not precede those who have fallen asleep for the lord himself will come down from heaven with a loud command with the voice of the archangel and with the trumpet call of god and the dead in christ will rise first after that we who are still alive and are left will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so we will be with the lord forever therefore encourage each other with these words now brothers about times and dates we do not need to write to you for you know very well that the day of the lord will come like a thief in the night while people are saying peace and safety destruction will come on them suddenly as labor pains on a pregnant woman and they will not escape but you brothers are not in darkness so that this day should surprise you like a thief you are all sons of the light and sons of the day we do not belong to the night or to the darkness so then let us not be like others who are asleep but let us be alert and self controlled for those who sleep sleep at night and those who get drunk get drunk at night but since we belong to the day let us be self controlled putting on faith and love as a breastplate and the hope of salvation as a helmet for god did not appoint us to suffer wrath but to receive salvation through our lord jesus christ he died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we may live together with him therefore encourage one another and build each other up just as in fact you are doing now we ask you brothers to respect those who work hard among you who are over you in the lord and who admonish you hold them in the highest regard in love because of their work live in peace with each other and we urge you brothers warn those who are idle encourage the timid help the weak be patient with everyone make sure that nobody pays back wrong for wrong but always try to be kind to each other and to everyone else be joyful always pray continually give thanks in all circumstances for this is gods will for you in christ jesus do not put out the spirits fire do not treat prophecies with contempt test everything hold on to the good avoid every kind of evil may god himself the god of peace sanctify you through and through may your whole spirit soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our lord jesus christ the one who calls you is faithful and he will do it brothers pray for us greet all the brothers with a holy kiss i charge you before the lord to have this letter read to all the brothers the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you  paul silas and timothy to the church of the thessalonians in god our father and the lord jesus christ grace and peace to you from god the father and the lord jesus christ we ought always to thank god for you brothers and rightly so because your faith is growing more and more and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing therefore among gods churches we boast about your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and trials you are enduring all this is evidence that gods judgment is right and as a result you will be counted worthy of the kingdom of god for which you are suffering god is just he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled and to us as well this will happen when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels he will punish those who do not know god and do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the majesty of his power on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marveled at among all those who have believed this includes you because you believed our testimony to you with this in mind we constantly pray for you that our god may count you worthy of his calling and that by his power he may fulfill every good purpose of yours and every act prompted by your faith we pray this so that the name of our lord jesus may be glorified in you and you in him according to the grace of our god and the lord jesus christ concerning the coming of our lord jesus christ and our being gathered to him we ask you brothers not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy report or letter supposed to have come from us saying that the day of the lord has already come dont let anyone deceive you in any way for that day will not come until the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed the man doomed to destruction he will oppose and will exalt himself over everything that is called god or is worshiped so that he sets himself up in gods temple proclaiming himself to be god dont you remember that when i was with you i used to tell you these things and now you know what is holding him back so that he may be revealed at the proper time for the secret power of lawlessness is already at work but the one who now holds it back will continue to do so till he is taken out of the way and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will overthrow with the breath of his mouth and destroy by the splendor of his coming the coming of the lawless one will be in accordance with the work of satan displayed in all kinds of counterfeit miracles signs and wonders and in every sort of evil that deceives those who are perishing they perish because they refused to love the truth and so be saved for this reason god sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie and so that all will be condemned who have not believed the truth but have delighted in wickedness but we ought always to thank god for you brothers loved by the lord because from the beginning god chose you to be saved through the sanctifying work of the spirit and through belief in the truth he called you to this through our gospel that you might share in the glory of our lord jesus christ so then brothers stand firm and hold to the teachings we passed on to you whether by word of mouth or by letter may our lord jesus christ himself and god our father who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal encouragement and good hope encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good deed and word finally brothers pray for us that the message of the lord may spread rapidly and be honored just as it was with you and pray that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men for not everyone has faith but the lord is faithful and he will strengthen and protect you from the evil one we have confidence in the lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we command may the lord direct your hearts into gods love and christs perseverance in the name of the lord jesus christ we command you brothers to keep away from every brother who is idle and does not live according to the teaching you received from us for you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example we were not idle when we were with you nor did we eat anyones food without paying for it on the contrary we worked night and day laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you we did this not because we do not have the right to such help but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow for even when we were with you we gave you this rule if a man will not work he shall not eat we hear that some among you are idle they are not busy they are busybodies such people we command and urge in the lord jesus christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat and as for you brothers never tire of doing what is right if anyone does not obey our instruction in this letter take special note of him do not associate with him in order that he may feel ashamed yet do not regard him as an enemy but warn him as a brother now may the lord of peace himself give you peace at all times and in every way the lord be with all of you i paul write this greeting in my own hand which is the distinguishing mark in all my letters this is how i write the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all  paul an apostle of christ jesus by the command of god our savior and of christ jesus our hope to timothy my true son in the faith grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord as i urged you when i went into macedonia stay there in ephesus so that you may command certain men not to teach false doctrines any longer nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies these promote controversies rather than gods work which is by faith the goal of this command is love which comes from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk they want to be teachers of the law but they do not know what they are talking about or what they so confidently affirm we know that the law is good if one uses it properly we also know that law is made not for the righteous but for lawbreakers and rebels the ungodly and sinful the unholy and irreligious for those who kill their fathers or mothers for murderers for adulterers and perverts for slave traders and liars and perjurers and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine that conforms to the glorious gospel of the blessed god which he entrusted to me i thank christ jesus our lord who has given me strength that he considered me faithful appointing me to his service even though i was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man i was shown mercy because i acted in ignorance and unbelief the grace of our lord was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in christ jesus here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am the worst but for that very reason i was shown mercy so that in me the worst of sinners christ jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life now to the king eternal immortal invisible the only god be honor and glory for ever and ever amen timothy my son i give you this instruction in keeping with the prophecies once made about you so that by following them you may fight the good fight holding on to faith and a good conscience some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith among them are hymenaeus and alexander whom i have handed over to satan to be taught not to blaspheme i urge then first of all that requests prayers intercession and thanksgiving be made for everyone for kings and all those in authority that we may live peaceful and quiet lives in all godliness and holiness this is good and pleases god our savior who wants all men to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth for there is one god and one mediator between god and men the man christ jesus who gave himself as a ransom for all men the testimony given in its proper time and for this purpose i was appointed a herald and an apostle i am telling the truth i am not lying and a teacher of the true faith to the gentiles i want men everywhere to lift up holy hands in prayer without anger or disputing i also want women to dress modestly with decency and propriety not with braided hair or gold or pearls or expensive clothes but with good deeds appropriate for women who profess to worship god a woman should learn in quietness and full submission i do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority over a man she must be silent for adam was formed first then eve and adam was not the one deceived it was the woman who was deceived and became a sinner but women will be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith love and holiness with propriety here is a trustworthy saying if anyone sets his heart on being an overseer he desires a noble task now the overseer must be above reproach the husband of but one wife temperate self controlled respectable hospitable able to teach not given to drunkenness not violent but gentle not quarrelsome not a lover of money he must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him with proper respect if anyone does not know how to manage his own family how can he take care of gods church he must not be a recent convert or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil he must also have a good reputation with outsiders so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devils trap deacons likewise are to be men worthy of respect sincere not indulging in much wine and not pursuing dishonest gain they must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience they must first be tested and then if there is nothing against them let them serve as deacons in the same way their wives are to be women worthy of respect not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything a deacon must be the husband of but one wife and must manage his children and his household well those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in christ jesus although i hope to come to you soon i am writing you these instructions so that if i am delayed you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in gods household which is the church of the living god the pillar and foundation of the truth beyond all question the mystery of godliness is great he appeared in a body was vindicated by the spirit was seen by angels was preached among the nations was believed on in the world was taken up in glory the spirit clearly says that in later times some will abandon the faith and follow deceiving spirits and things taught by demons such teachings come through hypocritical liars whose consciences have been seared as with a hot iron they forbid people to marry and order them to abstain from certain foods which god created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and who know the truth for everything god created is good and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving because it is consecrated by the word of god and prayer if you point these things out to the brothers you will be a good minister of christ jesus brought up in the truths of the faith and of the good teaching that you have followed have nothing to do with godless myths and old wives tales rather train yourself to be godly for physical training is of some value but godliness has value for all things holding promise for both the present life and the life to come this is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance and for this we labor and strive that we have put our hope in the living god who is the savior of all men and especially of those who believe command and teach these things dont let anyone look down on you because you are young but set an example for the believers in speech in life in love in faith and in purity until i come devote yourself to the public reading of scripture to preaching and to teaching do not neglect your gift which was given you through a prophetic message when the body of elders laid their hands on you be diligent in these matters give yourself wholly to them so that everyone may see your progress watch your life and doctrine closely persevere in them because if you do you will save both yourself and your hearers do not rebuke an older man harshly but exhort him as if he were your father treat younger men as brothers older women as mothers and younger women as sisters with absolute purity give proper recognition to those widows who are really in need but if a widow has children or grandchildren these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents for this is pleasing to god the widow who is really in need and left all alone puts her hope in god and continues night and day to pray and to ask god for help but the widow who lives for pleasure is dead even while she lives give the people these instructions too so that no one may be open to blame if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever no widow may be put on the list of widows unless she is over sixty has been faithful to her husband and is well known for her good deeds such as bringing up children showing hospitality washing the feet of the saints helping those in trouble and devoting herself to all kinds of good deeds as for younger widows do not put them on such a list for when their sensual desires overcome their dedication to christ they want to marry thus they bring judgment on themselves because they have broken their first pledge besides they get into the habit of being idle and going about from house to house and not only do they become idlers but also gossips and busybodies saying things they ought not to so i counsel younger widows to marry to have children to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander some have in fact already turned away to follow satan if any woman who is a believer has widows in her family she should help them and not let the church be burdened with them so that the church can help those widows who are really in need the elders who direct the affairs of the church well are worthy of double honor especially those whose work is preaching and teaching for the scripture says do not muzzle the ox while it is treading out the grain and the worker deserves his wages do not entertain an accusation against an elder unless it is brought by two or three witnesses those who sin are to be rebuked publicly so that the others may take warning i charge you in the sight of god and christ jesus and the elect angels to keep these instructions without partiality and to do nothing out of favoritism do not be hasty in the laying on of hands and do not share in the sins of others keep yourself pure stop drinking only water and use a little wine because of your stomach and your frequent illnesses the sins of some men are obvious reaching the place of judgment ahead of them the sins of others trail behind them in the same way good deeds are obvious and even those that are not cannot be hidden all who are under the yoke of slavery should consider their masters worthy of full respect so that gods name and our teaching may not be slandered those who have believing masters are not to show less respect for them because they are brothers instead they are to serve them even better because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them these are the things you are to teach and urge on them if anyone teaches false doctrines and does not agree to the sound instruction of our lord jesus christ and to godly teaching he is conceited and understands nothing he has an unhealthy interest in controversies and quarrels about words that result in envy strife malicious talk evil suspicions and constant friction between men of corrupt mind who have been robbed of the truth and who think that godliness is a means to financial gain but godliness with contentment is great gain for we brought nothing into the world and we can take nothing out of it but if we have food and clothing we will be content with that people who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil some people eager for money have wandered from the faith and pierced themselves with many griefs but you man of god flee from all this and pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance and gentleness fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made your good confession in the presence of many witnesses in the sight of god who gives life to everything and of christ jesus who while testifying before pontius pilate made the good confession i charge you to keep this command without spot or blame until the appearing of our lord jesus christ which god will bring about in his own time god the blessed and only ruler the king of kings and lord of lords who alone is immortal and who lives in unapproachable light whom no one has seen or can see to him be honor and might forever amen command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth which is so uncertain but to put their hope in god who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment command them to do good to be rich in good deeds and to be generous and willing to share in this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life timothy guard what has been entrusted to your care turn away from godless chatter and the opposing ideas of what is falsely called knowledge which some have professed and in so doing have wandered from the faith grace be with you  paul an apostle of christ jesus by the will of god according to the promise of life that is in christ jesus to timothy my dear son grace mercy and peace from god the father and christ jesus our lord i thank god whom i serve as my forefathers did with a clear conscience as night and day i constantly remember you in my prayers recalling your tears i long to see you so that i may be filled with joy i have been reminded of your sincere faith which first lived in your grandmother lois and in your mother eunice and i am persuaded now lives in you also for this reason i remind you to fan into flame the gift of god which is in you through the laying on of my hands for god did not give us a spirit of timidity but a spirit of power of love and of self discipline so do not be ashamed to testify about our lord or ashamed of me his prisoner but join with me in suffering for the gospel by the power of god who has saved us and called us to a holy life not because of anything we have done but because of his own purpose and grace this grace was given us in christ jesus before the beginning of time but it has now been revealed through the appearing of our savior christ jesus who has destroyed death and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel and of this gospel i was appointed a herald and an apostle and a teacher that is why i am suffering as i am yet i am not ashamed because i know whom i have believed and am convinced that he is able to guard what i have entrusted to him for that day what you heard from me keep as the pattern of sound teaching with faith and love in christ jesus guard the good deposit that was entrusted to you guard it with the help of the holy spirit who lives in us you know that everyone in the province of asia has deserted me including phygelus and hermogenes may the lord show mercy to the household of onesiphorus because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains on the contrary when he was in rome he searched hard for me until he found me may the lord grant that he will find mercy from the lord on that day you know very well in how many ways he helped me in ephesus you then my son be strong in the grace that is in christ jesus and the things you have heard me say in the presence of many witnesses entrust to reliable men who will also be qualified to teach others endure hardship with us like a good soldier of christ jesus no one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs he wants to please his commanding officer similarly if anyone competes as an athlete he does not receive the victors crown unless he competes according to the rules the hardworking farmer should be the first to receive a share of the crops reflect on what i am saying for the lord will give you insight into all this remember jesus christ raised from the dead descended from david this is my gospel for which i am suffering even to the point of being chained like a criminal but gods word is not chained therefore i endure everything for the sake of the elect that they too may obtain the salvation that is in christ jesus with eternal glory here is a trustworthy saying if we died with him we will also live with him if we endure we will also reign with him if we disown him he will also disown us if we are faithless he will remain faithful for he cannot disown himself keep reminding them of these things warn them before god against quarreling about words it is of no value and only ruins those who listen do your best to present yourself to god as one approved a workman who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly handles the word of truth avoid godless chatter because those who indulge in it will become more and more ungodly their teaching will spread like gangrene among them are hymenaeus and philetus who have wandered away from the truth they say that the resurrection has already taken place and they destroy the faith of some nevertheless gods solid foundation stands firm sealed with this inscription the lord knows those who are his and everyone who confesses the name of the lord must turn away from wickedness in a large house there are articles not only of gold and silver but also of wood and clay some are for noble purposes and some for ignoble if a man cleanses himself from the latter he will be an instrument for noble purposes made holy useful to the master and prepared to do any good work flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord out of a pure heart dont have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments because you know they produce quarrels and the lords servant must not quarrel instead he must be kind to everyone able to teach not resentful those who oppose him he must gently instruct in the hope that god will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil who has taken them captive to do his will but mark this there will be terrible times in the last days people will be lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful proud abusive disobedient to their parents ungrateful unholy without love unforgiving slanderous without self control brutal not lovers of the good treacherous rash conceited lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying its power have nothing to do with them they are the kind who worm their way into homes and gain control over weak willed women who are loaded down with sins and are swayed by all kinds of evil desires always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth just as jannes and jambres opposed moses so also these men oppose the truth men of depraved minds who as far as the faith is concerned are rejected but they will not get very far because as in the case of those men their folly will be clear to everyone you however know all about my teaching my way of life my purpose faith patience love endurance persecutions sufferings what kinds of things happened to me in antioch iconium and lystra the persecutions i endured yet the lord rescued me from all of them in fact everyone who wants to live a godly life in christ jesus will be persecuted while evil men and impostors will go from bad to worse deceiving and being deceived but as for you continue in what you have learned and have become convinced of because you know those from whom you learned it and how from infancy you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in christ jesus all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work in the presence of god and of christ jesus who will judge the living and the dead and in view of his appearing and his kingdom i give you this charge preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction for the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine instead to suit their own desires they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear they will turn their ears away from the truth and turn aside to myths but you keep your head in all situations endure hardship do the work of an evangelist discharge all the duties of your ministry for i am already being poured out like a drink offering and the time has come for my departure i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me but also to all who have longed for his appearing do your best to come to me quickly for demas because he loved this world has deserted me and has gone to thessalonica crescens has gone to galatia and titus to dalmatia only luke is with me get mark and bring him with you because he is helpful to me in my ministry i sent tychicus to ephesus when you come bring the cloak that i left with carpus at troas and my scrolls especially the parchments alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm the lord will repay him for what he has done you too should be on your guard against him because he strongly opposed our message at my first defense no one came to my support but everyone deserted me may it not be held against them but the lord stood at my side and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the gentiles might hear it and i was delivered from the lions mouth the lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will bring me safely to his heavenly kingdom to him be glory for ever and ever amen greet priscilla and aquila and the household of onesiphorus erastus stayed in corinth and i left trophimus sick in miletus do your best to get here before winter eubulus greets you and so do pudens linus claudia and all the brothers the lord be with your spirit grace be with you  paul a servant of god and an apostle of jesus christ for the faith of gods elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness a faith and knowledge resting on the hope of eternal life which god who does not lie promised before the beginning of time and at his appointed season he brought his word to light through the preaching entrusted to me by the command of god our savior to titus my true son in our common faith grace and peace from god the father and christ jesus our savior the reason i left you in crete was that you might straighten out what was left unfinished and appoint elders in every town as i directed you an elder must be blameless the husband of but one wife a man whose children believe and are not open to the charge of being wild and disobedient since an overseer is entrusted with gods work he must be blameless not overbearing not quick tempered not given to drunkenness not violent not pursuing dishonest gain rather he must be hospitable one who loves what is good who is self controlled upright holy and disciplined he must hold firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught so that he can encourage others by sound doctrine and refute those who oppose it for there are many rebellious people mere talkers and deceivers especially those of the circumcision group they must be silenced because they are ruining whole households by teaching things they ought not to teach and that for the sake of dishonest gain even one of their own prophets has said cretans are always liars evil brutes lazy gluttons this testimony is true therefore rebuke them sharply so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth to the pure all things are pure but to those who are corrupted and do not believe nothing is pure in fact both their minds and consciences are corrupted they claim to know god but by their actions they deny him they are detestable disobedient and unfit for doing anything good you must teach what is in accord with sound doctrine teach the older men to be temperate worthy of respect self controlled and sound in faith in love and in endurance likewise teach the older women to be reverent in the way they live not to be slanderers or addicted to much wine but to teach what is good then they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children to be self controlled and pure to be busy at home to be kind and to be subject to their husbands so that no one will malign the word of god similarly encourage the young men to be self controlled in everything set them an example by doing what is good in your teaching show integrity seriousness and soundness of speech that cannot be condemned so that those who oppose you may be ashamed because they have nothing bad to say about us teach slaves to be subject to their masters in everything to try to please them not to talk back to them and not to steal from them but to show that they can be fully trusted so that in every way they will make the teaching about god our savior attractive for the grace of god that brings salvation has appeared to all men it teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self controlled upright and godly lives in this present age while we wait for the blessed hope the glorious appearing of our great god and savior jesus christ who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself a people that are his very own eager to do what is good these then are the things you should teach encourage and rebuke with all authority do not let anyone despise you remind the people to be subject to rulers and authorities to be obedient to be ready to do whatever is good to slander no one to be peaceable and considerate and to show true humility toward all men at one time we too were foolish disobedient deceived and enslaved by all kinds of passions and pleasures we lived in malice and envy being hated and hating one another but when the kindness and love of god our savior appeared he saved us not because of righteous things we had done but because of his mercy he saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the holy spirit whom he poured out on us generously through jesus christ our savior so that having been justified by his grace we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life this is a trustworthy saying and i want you to stress these things so that those who have trusted in god may be careful to devote themselves to doing what is good these things are excellent and profitable for everyone but avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and arguments and quarrels about the law because these are unprofitable and useless warn a divisive person once and then warn him a second time after that have nothing to do with him you may be sure that such a man is warped and sinful he is self condemned as soon as i send artemas or tychicus to you do your best to come to me at nicopolis because i have decided to winter there do everything you can to help zenas the lawyer and apollos on their way and see that they have everything they need our people must learn to devote themselves to doing what is good in order that they may provide for daily necessities and not live unproductive lives everyone with me sends you greetings greet those who love us in the faith grace be with you all  paul a prisoner of christ jesus and timothy our brother to philemon our dear friend and fellow worker to apphia our sister to archippus our fellow soldier and to the church that meets in your home grace to you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ i always thank my god as i remember you in my prayers because i hear about your faith in the lord jesus and your love for all the saints i pray that you may be active in sharing your faith so that you will have a full understanding of every good thing we have in christ your love has given me great joy and encouragement because you brother have refreshed the hearts of the saints therefore although in christ i could be bold and order you to do what you ought to do yet i appeal to you on the basis of love i then as paul an old man and now also a prisoner of christ jesus i appeal to you for my son onesimus who became my son while i was in chains formerly he was useless to you but now he has become useful both to you and to me i am sending him who is my very heart back to you i would have liked to keep him with me so that he could take your place in helping me while i am in chains for the gospel but i did not want to do anything without your consent so that any favor you do will be spontaneous and not forced perhaps the reason he was separated from you for a little while was that you might have him back for good no longer as a slave but better than a slave as a dear brother he is very dear to me but even dearer to you both as a man and as a brother in the lord so if you consider me a partner welcome him as you would welcome me if he has done you any wrong or owes you anything charge it to me i paul am writing this with my own hand i will pay it back not to mention that you owe me your very self i do wish brother that i may have some benefit from you in the lord refresh my heart in christ confident of your obedience i write to you knowing that you will do even more than i ask and one thing more prepare a guest room for me because i hope to be restored to you in answer to your prayers epaphras my fellow prisoner in christ jesus sends you greetings and so do mark aristarchus demas and luke my fellow workers the grace of the lord jesus christ be with your spirit  in the past god spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways but in these last days he has spoken to us by his son whom he appointed heir of all things and through whom he made the universe the son is the radiance of gods glory and the exact representation of his being sustaining all things by his powerful word after he had provided purification for sins he sat down at the right hand of the majesty in heaven so he became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is superior to theirs for to which of the angels did god ever say you are my son today i have become your father or again i will be his father and he will be my son and again when god brings his firstborn into the world he says let all gods angels worship him in speaking of the angels he says he makes his angels winds his servants flames of fire but about the son he says your throne o god will last for ever and ever and righteousness will be the scepter of your kingdom you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness therefore god your god has set you above your companions by anointing you with the oil of joy he also says in the beginning o lord you laid the foundations of the earth and the heavens are the work of your hands they will perish but you remain they will all wear out like a garment you will roll them up like a robe like a garment they will be changed but you remain the same and your years will never end to which of the angels did god ever say sit at my right hand until i make your enemies a footstool for your feet are not all angels ministering spirits sent to serve those who will inherit salvation we must pay more careful attention therefore to what we have heard so that we do not drift away for if the message spoken by angels was binding and every violation and disobedience received its just punishment how shall we escape if we ignore such a great salvation this salvation which was first announced by the lord was confirmed to us by those who heard him god also testified to it by signs wonders and various miracles and gifts of the holy spirit distributed according to his will it is not to angels that he has subjected the world to come about which we are speaking but there is a place where someone has testified what is man that you are mindful of him the son of man that you care for him you made him a little lower than the angels you crowned him with glory and honor and put everything under his feet in putting everything under him god left nothing that is not subject to him yet at present we do not see everything subject to him but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death so that by the grace of god he might taste death for everyone in bringing many sons to glory it was fitting that god for whom and through whom everything exists should make the author of their salvation perfect through suffering both the one who makes men holy and those who are made holy are of the same family so jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers he says i will declare your name to my brothers in the presence of the congregation i will sing your praises and again i will put my trust in him and again he says here am i and the children god has given me since the children have flesh and blood he too shared in their humanity so that by his death he might destroy him who holds the power of death that is the devil and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death for surely it is not angels he helps but abrahams descendants for this reason he had to be made like his brothers in every way in order that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in service to god and that he might make atonement for the sins of the people because he himself suffered when he was tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted therefore holy brothers who share in the heavenly calling fix your thoughts on jesus the apostle and high priest whom we confess he was faithful to the one who appointed him just as moses was faithful in all gods house jesus has been found worthy of greater honor than moses just as the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself for every house is built by someone but god is the builder of everything moses was faithful as a servant in all gods house testifying to what would be said in the future but christ is faithful as a son over gods house and we are his house if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast so as the holy spirit says today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion during the time of testing in the desert where your fathers tested and tried me and for forty years saw what i did that is why i was angry with that generation and i said their hearts are always going astray and they have not known my ways so i declared on oath in my anger they shall never enter my rest see to it brothers that none of you has a sinful unbelieving heart that turns away from the living god but encourage one another daily as long as it is called today so that none of you may be hardened by sins deceitfulness we have come to share in christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first as has just been said today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts as you did in the rebellion who were they who heard and rebelled were they not all those moses led out of egypt and with whom was he angry for forty years was it not with those who sinned whose bodies fell in the desert and to whom did god swear that they would never enter his rest if not to those who disobeyed so we see that they were not able to enter because of their unbelief therefore since the promise of entering his rest still stands let us be careful that none of you be found to have fallen short of it for we also have had the gospel preached to us just as they did but the message they heard was of no value to them because those who heard did not combine it with faith now we who have believed enter that rest just as god has said so i declared on oath in my anger they shall never enter my rest and yet his work has been finished since the creation of the world for somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day in these words and on the seventh day god rested from all his work and again in the passage above he says they shall never enter my rest it still remains that some will enter that rest and those who formerly had the gospel preached to them did not go in because of their disobedience therefore god again set a certain day calling it today when a long time later he spoke through david as was said before today if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts for if joshua had given them rest god would not have spoken later about another day there remains then a sabbath rest for the people of god for anyone who enters gods rest also rests from his own work just as god did from his let us therefore make every effort to enter that rest so that no one will fall by following their example of disobedience for the word of god is living and active sharper than any double edged sword it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit joints and marrow it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart nothing in all creation is hidden from gods sight everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of him to whom we must give account therefore since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold firmly to the faith we profess for we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses but we have one who has been tempted in every way just as we are yet was without sin let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need every high priest is selected from among men and is appointed to represent them in matters related to god to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins he is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray since he himself is subject to weakness this is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for the sins of the people no one takes this honor upon himself he must be called by god just as aaron was so christ also did not take upon himself the glory of becoming a high priest but god said to him you are my son today i have become your father and he says in another place you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek during the days of jesus life on earth he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death and he was heard because of his reverent submission although he was a son he learned obedience from what he suffered and once made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him and was designated by god to be high priest in the order of melchizedek we have much to say about this but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn in fact though by this time you ought to be teachers you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of gods word all over again you need milk not solid food anyone who lives on milk being still an infant is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness but solid food is for the mature who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil therefore let us leave the elementary teachings about christ and go on to maturity not laying again the foundation of repentance from acts that lead to death and of faith in god instruction about baptisms the laying on of hands the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment and god permitting we will do so it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift who have shared in the holy spirit who have tasted the goodness of the word of god and the powers of the coming age if they fall away to be brought back to repentance because to their loss they are crucifying the son of god all over again and subjecting him to public disgrace land that drinks in the rain often falling on it and that produces a crop useful to those for whom it is farmed receives the blessing of god but land that produces thorns and thistles is worthless and is in danger of being cursed in the end it will be burned even though we speak like this dear friends we are confident of better things in your case things that accompany salvation god is not unjust he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them we want each of you to show this same diligence to the very end in order to make your hope sure we do not want you to become lazy but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit what has been promised when god made his promise to abraham since there was no one greater for him to swear by he swore by himself saying i will surely bless you and give you many descendants and so after waiting patiently abraham received what was promised men swear by someone greater than themselves and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument because god wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised he confirmed it with an oath god did this so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for god to lie we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged we have this hope as an anchor for the soul firm and secure it enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain where jesus who went before us has entered on our behalf he has become a high priest forever in the order of melchizedek this melchizedek was king of salem and priest of god most high he met abraham returning from the defeat of the kings and blessed him and abraham gave him a tenth of everything first his name means king of righteousness then also king of salem means king of peace without father or mother without genealogy without beginning of days or end of life like the son of god he remains a priest forever just think how great he was even the patriarch abraham gave him a tenth of the plunder now the law requires the descendants of levi who become priests to collect a tenth from the people that is their brothers even though their brothers are descended from abraham this man however did not trace his descent from levi yet he collected a tenth from abraham and blessed him who had the promises and without doubt the lesser person is blessed by the greater in the one case the tenth is collected by men who die but in the other case by him who is declared to be living one might even say that levi who collects the tenth paid the tenth through abraham because when melchizedek met abraham levi was still in the body of his ancestor if perfection could have been attained through the levitical priesthood for on the basis of it the law was given to the people why was there still need for another priest to come one in the order of melchizedek not in the order of aaron for when there is a change of the priesthood there must also be a change of the law he of whom these things are said belonged to a different tribe and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar for it is clear that our lord descended from judah and in regard to that tribe moses said nothing about priests and what we have said is even more clear if another priest like melchizedek appears one who has become a priest not on the basis of a regulation as to his ancestry but on the basis of the power of an indestructible life for it is declared you are a priest forever in the order of melchizedek the former regulation is set aside because it was weak and useless for the law made nothing perfect and a better hope is introduced by which we draw near to god and it was not without an oath others became priests without any oath but he became a priest with an oath when god said to him the lord has sworn and will not change his mind you are a priest forever because of this oath jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant now there have been many of those priests since death prevented them from continuing in office but because jesus lives forever he has a permanent priesthood therefore he is able to save completely those who come to god through him because he always lives to intercede for them such a high priest meets our need one who is holy blameless pure set apart from sinners exalted above the heavens unlike the other high priests he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people he sacrificed for their sins once for all when he offered himself for the law appoints as high priests men who are weak but the oath which came after the law appointed the son who has been made perfect forever the point of what we are saying is this we do have such a high priest who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the majesty in heaven and who serves in the sanctuary the true tabernacle set up by the lord not by man every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices and so it was necessary for this one also to have something to offer if he were on earth he would not be a priest for there are already men who offer the gifts prescribed by the law they serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven this is why moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle see to it that you make everything according to the pattern shown you on the mountain but the ministry jesus has received is as superior to theirs as the covenant of which he is mediator is superior to the old one and it is founded on better promises for if there had been nothing wrong with that first covenant no place would have been sought for another but god found fault with the people and said the time is coming declares the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah it will not be like the covenant i made with their forefathers when i took them by the hand to lead them out of egypt because they did not remain faithful to my covenant and i turned away from them declares the lord this is the covenant i will make with the house of israel after that time declares the lord i will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts i will be their god and they will be my people no longer will a man teach his neighbor or a man his brother saying know the lord because they will all know me from the least of them to the greatest for i will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more by calling this covenant new he has made the first one obsolete and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear now the first covenant had regulations for worship and also an earthly sanctuary a tabernacle was set up in its first room were the lampstand the table and the consecrated bread this was called the holy place behind the second curtain was a room called the most holy place which had the golden altar of incense and the gold covered ark of the covenant this ark contained the gold jar of manna aarons staff that had budded and the stone tablets of the covenant above the ark were the cherubim of the glory overshadowing the atonement cover but we cannot discuss these things in detail now when everything had been arranged like this the priests entered regularly into the outer room to carry on their ministry but only the high priest entered the inner room and that only once a year and never without blood which he offered for himself and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance the holy spirit was showing by this that the way into the most holy place had not yet been disclosed as long as the first tabernacle was still standing this is an illustration for the present time indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered were not able to clear the conscience of the worshiper they are only a matter of food and drink and various ceremonial washings external regulations applying until the time of the new order when christ came as high priest of the good things that are already here he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that is not man made that is to say not a part of this creation he did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves but he entered the most holy place once for all by his own blood having obtained eternal redemption the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are ceremonially unclean sanctify them so that they are outwardly clean how much more then will the blood of christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself unblemished to god cleanse our consciences from acts that lead to death so that we may serve the living god for this reason christ is the mediator of a new covenant that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance now that he has died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant in the case of a will it is necessary to prove the death of the one who made it because a will is in force only when somebody has died it never takes effect while the one who made it is living this is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood when moses had proclaimed every commandment of the law to all the people he took the blood of calves together with water scarlet wool and branches of hyssop and sprinkled the scroll and all the people he said this is the blood of the covenant which god has commanded you to keep in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in its ceremonies in fact the law requires that nearly everything be cleansed with blood and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness it was necessary then for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these sacrifices but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for christ did not enter a man made sanctuary that was only a copy of the true one he entered heaven itself now to appear for us in gods presence nor did he enter heaven to offer himself again and again the way the high priest enters the most holy place every year with blood that is not his own then christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world but now he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself just as man is destined to die once and after that to face judgment so christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people and he will appear a second time not to bear sin but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him the law is only a shadow of the good things that are coming not the realities themselves for this reason it can never by the same sacrifices repeated endlessly year after year make perfect those who draw near to worship if it could would they not have stopped being offered for the worshipers would have been cleansed once for all and would no longer have felt guilty for their sins but those sacrifices are an annual reminder of sins because it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins therefore when christ came into the world he said sacrifice and offering you did not desire but a body you prepared for me with burnt offerings and sin offerings you were not pleased then i said here i am it is written about me in the scroll i have come to do your will o god first he said sacrifices and offerings burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not desire nor were you pleased with them although the law required them to be made then he said here i am i have come to do your will he sets aside the first to establish the second and by that will we have been made holy through the sacrifice of the body of jesus christ once for all day after day every priest stands and performs his religious duties again and again he offers the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins he sat down at the right hand of god since that time he waits for his enemies to be made his footstool because by one sacrifice he has made perfect forever those who are being made holy the holy spirit also testifies to us about this first he says this is the covenant i will make with them after that time says the lord i will put my laws in their hearts and i will write them on their minds then he adds their sins and lawless acts i will remember no more and where these have been forgiven there is no longer any sacrifice for sin therefore brothers since we have confidence to enter the most holy place by the blood of jesus by a new and living way opened for us through the curtain that is his body and since we have a great priest over the house of god let us draw near to god with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water let us hold unswervingly to the hope we profess for he who promised is faithful and let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds let us not give up meeting together as some are in the habit of doing but let us encourage one another and all the more as you see the day approaching if we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth no sacrifice for sins is left but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of raging fire that will consume the enemies of god anyone who rejected the law of moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses how much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the son of god under foot who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him and who has insulted the spirit of grace for we know him who said it is mine to avenge i will repay and again the lord will judge his people it is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living god remember those earlier days after you had received the light when you stood your ground in a great contest in the face of suffering sometimes you were publicly exposed to insult and persecution at other times you stood side by side with those who were so treated you sympathized with those in prison and joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property because you knew that you yourselves had better and lasting possessions so do not throw away your confidence it will be richly rewarded you need to persevere so that when you have done the will of god you will receive what he has promised for in just a very little while he who is coming will come and will not delay but my righteous one will live by faith and if he shrinks back i will not be pleased with him but we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed but of those who believe and are saved now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see this is what the ancients were commended for by faith we understand that the universe was formed at gods command so that what is seen was not made out of what was visible by faith abel offered god a better sacrifice than cain did by faith he was commended as a righteous man when god spoke well of his offerings and by faith he still speaks even though he is dead by faith enoch was taken from this life so that he did not experience death he could not be found because god had taken him away for before he was taken he was commended as one who pleased god and without faith it is impossible to please god because anyone who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who earnestly seek him by faith noah when warned about things not yet seen in holy fear built an ark to save his family by his faith he condemned the world and became heir of the righteousness that comes by faith by faith abraham when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance obeyed and went even though he did not know where he was going by faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger in a foreign country he lived in tents as did isaac and jacob who were heirs with him of the same promise for he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect and builder is god by faith abraham even though he was past age and sarah herself was barren was enabled to become a father because he considered him faithful who had made the promise and so from this one man and he as good as dead came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore all these people were still living by faith when they died they did not receive the things promised they only saw them and welcomed them from a distance and they admitted that they were aliens and strangers on earth people who say such things show that they are looking for a country of their own if they had been thinking of the country they had left they would have had opportunity to return instead they were longing for a better country a heavenly one therefore god is not ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared a city for them by faith abraham when god tested him offered isaac as a sacrifice he who had received the promises was about to sacrifice his one and only son even though god had said to him it is through isaac that your offspring will be reckoned abraham reasoned that god could raise the dead and figuratively speaking he did receive isaac back from death by faith isaac blessed jacob and esau in regard to their future by faith jacob when he was dying blessed each of josephs sons and worshiped as he leaned on the top of his staff by faith joseph when his end was near spoke about the exodus of the israelites from egypt and gave instructions about his bones by faith moses parents hid him for three months after he was born because they saw he was no ordinary child and they were not afraid of the kings edict by faith moses when he had grown up refused to be known as the son of pharaohs daughter he chose to be mistreated along with the people of god rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time he regarded disgrace for the sake of christ as of greater value than the treasures of egypt because he was looking ahead to his reward by faith he left egypt not fearing the kings anger he persevered because he saw him who is invisible by faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood so that the destroyer of the firstborn would not touch the firstborn of israel by faith the people passed through the red sea as on dry land but when the egyptians tried to do so they were drowned by faith the walls of jericho fell after the people had marched around them for seven days by faith the prostitute rahab because she welcomed the spies was not killed with those who were disobedient and what more shall i say i do not have time to tell about gideon barak samson jephthah david samuel and the prophets who through faith conquered kingdoms administered justice and gained what was promised who shut the mouths of lions quenched the fury of the flames and escaped the edge of the sword whose weakness was turned to strength and who became powerful in battle and routed foreign armies women received back their dead raised to life again others were tortured and refused to be released so that they might gain a better resurrection some faced jeers and flogging while still others were chained and put in prison they were stoned they were sawed in two they were put to death by the sword they went about in sheepskins and goatskins destitute persecuted and mistreated the world was not worthy of them they wandered in deserts and mountains and in caves and holes in the ground these were all commended for their faith yet none of them received what had been promised god had planned something better for us so that only together with us would they be made perfect therefore since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles and let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us let us fix our eyes on jesus the author and perfecter of our faith who for the joy set before him endured the cross scorning its shame and sat down at the right hand of the throne of god consider him who endured such opposition from sinful men so that you will not grow weary and lose heart in your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood and you have forgotten that word of encouragement that addresses you as sons my son do not make light of the lords discipline and do not lose heart when he rebukes you because the lord disciplines those he loves and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son endure hardship as discipline god is treating you as sons for what son is not disciplined by his father if you are not disciplined and everyone undergoes discipline then you are illegitimate children and not true sons moreover we have all had human fathers who disciplined us and we respected them for it how much more should we submit to the father of our spirits and live our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought best but god disciplines us for our good that we may share in his holiness no discipline seems pleasant at the time but painful later on however it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it therefore strengthen your feeble arms and weak knees make level paths for your feet so that the lame may not be disabled but rather healed make every effort to live in peace with all men and to be holy without holiness no one will see the lord see to it that no one misses the grace of god and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and defile many see that no one is sexually immoral or is godless like esau who for a single meal sold his inheritance rights as the oldest son afterward as you know when he wanted to inherit this blessing he was rejected he could bring about no change of mind though he sought the blessing with tears you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire to darkness gloom and storm to a trumpet blast or to such a voice speaking words that those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them because they could not bear what was commanded if even an animal touches the mountain it must be stoned the sight was so terrifying that moses said i am trembling with fear but you have come to mount zion to the heavenly jerusalem the city of the living god you have come to thousands upon thousands of angels in joyful assembly to the church of the firstborn whose names are written in heaven you have come to god the judge of all men to the spirits of righteous men made perfect to jesus the mediator of a new covenant and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of abel see to it that you do not refuse him who speaks if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth how much less will we if we turn away from him who warns us from heaven at that time his voice shook the earth but now he has promised once more i will shake not only the earth but also the heavens the words once more indicate the removing of what can be shaken that is created things so that what cannot be shaken may remain therefore since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire keep on loving each other as brothers do not forget to entertain strangers for by so doing some people have entertained angels without knowing it remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering marriage should be honored by all and the marriage bed kept pure for god will judge the adulterer and all the sexually immoral keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have because god has said never will i leave you never will i forsake you so we say with confidence the lord is my helper i will not be afraid what can man do to me remember your leaders who spoke the word of god to you consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith jesus christ is the same yesterday and today and forever do not be carried away by all kinds of strange teachings it is good for our hearts to be strengthened by grace not by ceremonial foods which are of no value to those who eat them we have an altar from which those who minister at the tabernacle have no right to eat the high priest carries the blood of animals into the most holy place as a sin offering but the bodies are burned outside the camp and so jesus also suffered outside the city gate to make the people holy through his own blood let us then go to him outside the camp bearing the disgrace he bore for here we do not have an enduring city but we are looking for the city that is to come through jesus therefore let us continually offer to god a sacrifice of praise the fruit of lips that confess his name and do not forget to do good and to share with others for with such sacrifices god is pleased obey your leaders and submit to their authority they keep watch over you as men who must give an account obey them so that their work will be a joy not a burden for that would be of no advantage to you pray for us we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way i particularly urge you to pray so that i may be restored to you soon may the god of peace who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our lord jesus that great shepherd of the sheep equip you with everything good for doing his will and may he work in us what is pleasing to him through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever amen brothers i urge you to bear with my word of exhortation for i have written you only a short letter i want you to know that our brother timothy has been released if he arrives soon i will come with him to see you greet all your leaders and all gods people those from italy send you their greetings grace be with you all  james a servant of god and of the lord jesus christ to the twelve tribes scattered among the nations greetings consider it pure joy my brothers whenever you face trials of many kinds because you know that the testing of your faith develops perseverance perseverance must finish its work so that you may be mature and complete not lacking anything if any of you lacks wisdom he should ask god who gives generously to all without finding fault and it will be given to him but when he asks he must believe and not doubt because he who doubts is like a wave of the sea blown and tossed by the wind that man should not think he will receive anything from the lord he is a double minded man unstable in all he does the brother in humble circumstances ought to take pride in his high position but the one who is rich should take pride in his low position because he will pass away like a wild flower for the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant its blossom falls and its beauty is destroyed in the same way the rich man will fade away even while he goes about his business blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life that god has promised to those who love him when tempted no one should say god is tempting me for god cannot be tempted by evil nor does he tempt anyone but each one is tempted when by his own evil desire he is dragged away and enticed then after desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown gives birth to death dont be deceived my dear brothers every good and perfect gift is from above coming down from the father of the heavenly lights who does not change like shifting shadows he chose to give us birth through the word of truth that we might be a kind of firstfruits of all he created my dear brothers take note of this everyone should be quick to listen slow to speak and slow to become angry for mans anger does not bring about the righteous life that god desires therefore get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you which can save you do not merely listen to the word and so deceive yourselves do what it says anyone who listens to the word but does not do what it says is like a man who looks at his face in a mirror and after looking at himself goes away and immediately forgets what he looks like but the man who looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom and continues to do this not forgetting what he has heard but doing it he will be blessed in what he does if anyone considers himself religious and yet does not keep a tight rein on his tongue he deceives himself and his religion is worthless religion that god our father accepts as pure and faultless is this to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world my brothers as believers in our glorious lord jesus christ dont show favoritism suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in if you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say heres a good seat for you but say to the poor man you stand there or sit on the floor by my feet have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts listen my dear brothers has not god chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him but you have insulted the poor is it not the rich who are exploiting you are they not the ones who are dragging you into court are they not the ones who are slandering the noble name of him to whom you belong if you really keep the royal law found in scripture love your neighbor as yourself you are doing right but if you show favoritism you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers for whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it for he who said do not commit adultery also said do not murder if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder you have become a lawbreaker speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful mercy triumphs over judgment what good is it my brothers if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds can such faith save him suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food if one of you says to him go i wish you well keep warm and well fed but does nothing about his physical needs what good is it in the same way faith by itself if it is not accompanied by action is dead but someone will say you have faith i have deeds show me your faith without deeds and i will show you my faith by what i do you believe that there is one god good even the demons believe that and shudder you foolish man do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless was not our ancestor abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son isaac on the altar you see that his faith and his actions were working together and his faith was made complete by what he did and the scripture was fulfilled that says abraham believed god and it was credited to him as righteousness and he was called gods friend you see that a person is justified by what he does and not by faith alone in the same way was not even rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without deeds is dead not many of you should presume to be teachers my brothers because you know that we who teach will be judged more strictly we all stumble in many ways if anyone is never at fault in what he says he is a perfect man able to keep his whole body in check when we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us we can turn the whole animal or take ships as an example although they are so large and are driven by strong winds they are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go likewise the tongue is a small part of the body but it makes great boasts consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark the tongue also is a fire a world of evil among the parts of the body it corrupts the whole person sets the whole course of his life on fire and is itself set on fire by hell all kinds of animals birds reptiles and creatures of the sea are being tamed and have been tamed by man but no man can tame the tongue it is a restless evil full of deadly poison with the tongue we praise our lord and father and with it we curse men who have been made in gods likeness out of the same mouth come praise and cursing my brothers this should not be can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring my brothers can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs neither can a salt spring produce fresh water who is wise and understanding among you let him show it by his good life by deeds done in the humility that comes from wisdom but if you harbor bitter envy and selfish ambition in your hearts do not boast about it or deny the truth such wisdom does not come down from heaven but is earthly unspiritual of the devil for where you have envy and selfish ambition there you find disorder and every evil practice but the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure then peace loving considerate submissive full of mercy and good fruit impartial and sincere peacemakers who sow in peace raise a harvest of righteousness what causes fights and quarrels among you dont they come from your desires that battle within you you want something but dont get it you kill and covet but you cannot have what you want you quarrel and fight you do not have because you do not ask god when you ask you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend what you get on your pleasures you adulterous people dont you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward god anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of god or do you think scripture says without reason that the spirit he caused to live in us envies intensely but he gives us more grace that is why scripture says god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble submit yourselves then to god resist the devil and he will flee from you come near to god and he will come near to you wash your hands you sinners and purify your hearts you double minded grieve mourn and wail change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom humble yourselves before the lord and he will lift you up brothers do not slander one another anyone who speaks against his brother or judges him speaks against the law and judges it when you judge the law you are not keeping it but sitting in judgment on it there is only one lawgiver and judge the one who is able to save and destroy but you who are you to judge your neighbor now listen you who say today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city spend a year there carry on business and make money why you do not even know what will happen tomorrow what is your life you are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes instead you ought to say if it is the lords will we will live and do this or that as it is you boast and brag all such boasting is evil anyone then who knows the good he ought to do and doesnt do it sins now listen you rich people weep and wail because of the misery that is coming upon you your wealth has rotted and moths have eaten your clothes your gold and silver are corroded their corrosion will testify against you and eat your flesh like fire you have hoarded wealth in the last days look the wages you failed to pay the workmen who mowed your fields are crying out against you the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the lord almighty you have lived on earth in luxury and self indulgence you have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter you have condemned and murdered innocent men who were not opposing you be patient then brothers until the lords coming see how the farmer waits for the land to yield its valuable crop and how patient he is for the autumn and spring rains you too be patient and stand firm because the lords coming is near dont grumble against each other brothers or you will be judged the judge is standing at the door brothers as an example of patience in the face of suffering take the prophets who spoke in the name of the lord as you know we consider blessed those who have persevered you have heard of jobs perseverance and have seen what the lord finally brought about the lord is full of compassion and mercy above all my brothers do not swear not by heaven or by earth or by anything else let your yes be yes and your no no or you will be condemned is any one of you in trouble he should pray is anyone happy let him sing songs of praise is any one of you sick he should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well the lord will raise him up if he has sinned he will be forgiven therefore confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed the prayer of a righteous man is powerful and effective elijah was a man just like us he prayed earnestly that it would not rain and it did not rain on the land for three and a half years again he prayed and the heavens gave rain and the earth produced its crops my brothers if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back remember this whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins  peter an apostle of jesus christ to gods elect strangers in the world scattered throughout pontus galatia cappadocia asia and bithynia who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of god the father through the sanctifying work of the spirit for obedience to jesus christ and sprinkling by his blood grace and peace be yours in abundance praise be to the god and father of our lord jesus christ in his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish spoil or fade kept in heaven for you who through faith are shielded by gods power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time in this you greatly rejoice though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials these have come so that your faith of greater worth than gold which perishes even though refined by fire may be proved genuine and may result in praise glory and honor when jesus christ is revealed though you have not seen him you love him and even though you do not see him now you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy for you are receiving the goal of your faith the salvation of your souls concerning this salvation the prophets who spoke of the grace that was to come to you searched intently and with the greatest care trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the spirit of christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of christ and the glories that would follow it was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the holy spirit sent from heaven even angels long to look into these things therefore prepare your minds for action be self controlled set your hope fully on the grace to be given you when jesus christ is revealed as obedient children do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance but just as he who called you is holy so be holy in all you do for it is written be holy because i am holy since you call on a father who judges each mans work impartially live your lives as strangers here in reverent fear for you know that it was not with perishable things such as silver or gold that you were redeemed from the empty way of life handed down to you from your forefathers but with the precious blood of christ a lamb without blemish or defect he was chosen before the creation of the world but was revealed in these last times for your sake through him you believe in god who raised him from the dead and glorified him and so your faith and hope are in god now that you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth so that you have sincere love for your brothers love one another deeply from the heart for you have been born again not of perishable seed but of imperishable through the living and enduring word of god for all men are like grass and all their glory is like the flowers of the field the grass withers and the flowers fall but the word of the lord stands forever and this is the word that was preached to you therefore rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit hypocrisy envy and slander of every kind like newborn babies crave pure spiritual milk so that by it you may grow up in your salvation now that you have tasted that the lord is good as you come to him the living stone rejected by men but chosen by god and precious to him you also like living stones are being built into a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god through jesus christ for in scripture it says see i lay a stone in zion a chosen and precious cornerstone and the one who trusts in him will never be put to shame now to you who believe this stone is precious but to those who do not believe the stone the builders rejected has become the capstone and a stone that causes men to stumble and a rock that makes them fall they stumble because they disobey the message which is also what they were destined for but you are a chosen people a royal priesthood a holy nation a people belonging to god that you may declare the praises of him who called you out of darkness into his wonderful light once you were not a people but now you are the people of god once you had not received mercy but now you have received mercy dear friends i urge you as aliens and strangers in the world to abstain from sinful desires which war against your soul live such good lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong they may see your good deeds and glorify god on the day he visits us submit yourselves for the lords sake to every authority instituted among men whether to the king as the supreme authority or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to commend those who do right for it is gods will that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish men live as free men but do not use your freedom as a cover up for evil live as servants of god show proper respect to everyone love the brotherhood of believers fear god honor the king slaves submit yourselves to your masters with all respect not only to those who are good and considerate but also to those who are harsh for it is commendable if a man bears up under the pain of unjust suffering because he is conscious of god but how is it to your credit if you receive a beating for doing wrong and endure it but if you suffer for doing good and you endure it this is commendable before god to this you were called because christ suffered for you leaving you an example that you should follow in his steps he committed no sin and no deceit was found in his mouth when they hurled their insults at him he did not retaliate when he suffered he made no threats instead he entrusted himself to him who judges justly he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness by his wounds you have been healed for you were like sheep going astray but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls wives in the same way be submissive to your husbands so that if any of them do not believe the word they may be won over without words by the behavior of their wives when they see the purity and reverence of your lives your beauty should not come from outward adornment such as braided hair and the wearing of gold jewelry and fine clothes instead it should be that of your inner self the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit which is of great worth in gods sight for this is the way the holy women of the past who put their hope in god used to make themselves beautiful they were submissive to their own husbands like sarah who obeyed abraham and called him her master you are her daughters if you do what is right and do not give way to fear husbands in the same way be considerate as you live with your wives and treat them with respect as the weaker partner and as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life so that nothing will hinder your prayers finally all of you live in harmony with one another be sympathetic love as brothers be compassionate and humble do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult but with blessing because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing for whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech he must turn from evil and do good he must seek peace and pursue it for the eyes of the lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer but the face of the lord is against those who do evil who is going to harm you if you are eager to do good but even if you should suffer for what is right you are blessed do not fear what they fear do not be frightened but in your hearts set apart christ as lord always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have but do this with gentleness and respect keeping a clear conscience so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in christ may be ashamed of their slander it is better if it is gods will to suffer for doing good than for doing evil for christ died for sins once for all the righteous for the unrighteous to bring you to god he was put to death in the body but made alive by the spirit through whom also he went and preached to the spirits in prison who disobeyed long ago when god waited patiently in the days of noah while the ark was being built in it only a few people eight in all were saved through water and this water symbolizes baptism that now saves you also not the removal of dirt from the body but the pledge of a good conscience toward god it saves you by the resurrection of jesus christ who has gone into heaven and is at gods right hand with angels authorities and powers in submission to him therefore since christ suffered in his body arm yourselves also with the same attitude because he who has suffered in his body is done with sin as a result he does not live the rest of his earthly life for evil human desires but rather for the will of god for you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do living in debauchery lust drunkenness orgies carousing and detestable idolatry they think it strange that you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation and they heap abuse on you but they will have to give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead for this is the reason the gospel was preached even to those who are now dead so that they might be judged according to men in regard to the body but live according to god in regard to the spirit the end of all things is near therefore be clear minded and self controlled so that you can pray above all love each other deeply because love covers over a multitude of sins offer hospitality to one another without grumbling each one should use whatever gift he has received to serve others faithfully administering gods grace in its various forms if anyone speaks he should do it as one speaking the very words of god if anyone serves he should do it with the strength god provides so that in all things god may be praised through jesus christ to him be the glory and the power for ever and ever amen dear friends do not be surprised at the painful trial you are suffering as though something strange were happening to you but rejoice that you participate in the sufferings of christ so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed if you are insulted because of the name of christ you are blessed for the spirit of glory and of god rests on you if you suffer it should not be as a murderer or thief or any other kind of criminal or even as a meddler however if you suffer as a christian do not be ashamed but praise god that you bear that name for it is time for judgment to begin with the family of god and if it begins with us what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of god and if it is hard for the righteous to be saved what will become of the ungodly and the sinner so then those who suffer according to gods will should commit themselves to their faithful creator and continue to do good to the elders among you i appeal as a fellow elder a witness of christs sufferings and one who also will share in the glory to be revealed be shepherds of gods flock that is under your care serving as overseers not because you must but because you are willing as god wants you to be not greedy for money but eager to serve not lording it over those entrusted to you but being examples to the flock and when the chief shepherd appears you will receive the crown of glory that will never fade away young men in the same way be submissive to those who are older all of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another because god opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble humble yourselves therefore under gods mighty hand that he may lift you up in due time cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you be self controlled and alert your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour resist him standing firm in the faith because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings and the god of all grace who called you to his eternal glory in christ after you have suffered a little while will himself restore you and make you strong firm and steadfast to him be the power for ever and ever amen with the help of silas whom i regard as a faithful brother i have written to you briefly encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of god stand fast in it she who is in babylon chosen together with you sends you her greetings and so does my son mark greet one another with a kiss of love peace to all of you who are in christ  simon peter a servant and apostle of jesus christ to those who through the righteousness of our god and savior jesus christ have received a faith as precious as ours grace and peace be yours in abundance through the knowledge of god and of jesus our lord his divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness through these he has given us his very great and precious promises so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and escape the corruption in the world caused by evil desires for this very reason make every effort to add to your faith goodness and to goodness knowledge and to knowledge self control and to self control perseverance and to perseverance godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness love for if you possess these qualities in increasing measure they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our lord jesus christ but if anyone does not have them he is nearsighted and blind and has forgotten that he has been cleansed from his past sins therefore my brothers be all the more eager to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you will never fall and you will receive a rich welcome into the eternal kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ so i will always remind you of these things even though you know them and are firmly established in the truth you now have i think it is right to refresh your memory as long as i live in the tent of this body because i know that i will soon put it aside as our lord jesus christ has made clear to me and i will make every effort to see that after my departure you will always be able to remember these things we did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our lord jesus christ but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty for he received honor and glory from god the father when the voice came to him from the majestic glory saying this is my son whom i love with him i am well pleased we ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain and we have the word of the prophets made more certain and you will do well to pay attention to it as to a light shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts above all you must understand that no prophecy of scripture came about by the prophets own interpretation for prophecy never had its origin in the will of man but men spoke from god as they were carried along by the holy spirit but there were also false prophets among the people just as there will be false teachers among you they will secretly introduce destructive heresies even denying the sovereign lord who bought them bringing swift destruction on themselves many will follow their shameful ways and will bring the way of truth into disrepute in their greed these teachers will exploit you with stories they have made up their condemnation has long been hanging over them and their destruction has not been sleeping for if god did not spare angels when they sinned but sent them to hell putting them into gloomy dungeons to be held for judgment if he did not spare the ancient world when he brought the flood on its ungodly people but protected noah a preacher of righteousness and seven others if he condemned the cities of sodom and gomorrah by burning them to ashes and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly and if he rescued lot a righteous man who was distressed by the filthy lives of lawless men for that righteous man living among them day after day was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard if this is so then the lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment while continuing their punishment this is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority bold and arrogant these men are not afraid to slander celestial beings yet even angels although they are stronger and more powerful do not bring slanderous accusations against such beings in the presence of the lord but these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand they are like brute beasts creatures of instinct born only to be caught and destroyed and like beasts they too will perish they will be paid back with harm for the harm they have done their idea of pleasure is to carouse in broad daylight they are blots and blemishes reveling in their pleasures while they feast with you with eyes full of adultery they never stop sinning they seduce the unstable they are experts in greed an accursed brood they have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of balaam son of beor who loved the wages of wickedness but he was rebuked for his wrongdoing by a donkey a beast without speech who spoke with a mans voice and restrained the prophets madness these men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm blackest darkness is reserved for them for they mouth empty boastful words and by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error they promise them freedom while they themselves are slaves of depravity for a man is a slave to whatever has mastered him if they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our lord and savior jesus christ and are again entangled in it and overcome they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them of them the proverbs are true a dog returns to its vomit and a sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud dear friends this is now my second letter to you i have written both of them as reminders to stimulate you to wholesome thinking i want you to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the command given by our lord and savior through your apostles first of all you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come scoffing and following their own evil desires they will say where is this coming he promised ever since our fathers died everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation but they deliberately forget that long ago by gods word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water by these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men but do not forget this one thing dear friends with the lord a day is like a thousand years and a thousand years are like a day the lord is not slow in keeping his promise as some understand slowness he is patient with you not wanting anyone to perish but everyone to come to repentance but the day of the lord will come like a thief the heavens will disappear with a roar the elements will be destroyed by fire and the earth and everything in it will be laid bare since everything will be destroyed in this way what kind of people ought you to be you ought to live holy and godly lives as you look forward to the day of god and speed its coming that day will bring about the destruction of the heavens by fire and the elements will melt in the heat but in keeping with his promise we are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth the home of righteousness so then dear friends since you are looking forward to this make every effort to be found spotless blameless and at peace with him bear in mind that our lords patience means salvation just as our dear brother paul also wrote you with the wisdom that god gave him he writes the same way in all his letters speaking in them of these matters his letters contain some things that are hard to understand which ignorant and unstable people distort as they do the other scriptures to their own destruction therefore dear friends since you already know this be on your guard so that you may not be carried away by the error of lawless men and fall from your secure position but grow in the grace and knowledge of our lord and savior jesus christ to him be glory both now and forever amen  that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked at and our hands have touched this we proclaim concerning the word of life the life appeared we have seen it and testify to it and we proclaim to you the eternal life which was with the father and has appeared to us we proclaim to you what we have seen and heard so that you also may have fellowship with us and our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ we write this to make our joy complete this is the message we have heard from him and declare to you god is light in him there is no darkness at all if we claim to have fellowship with him yet walk in the darkness we lie and do not live by the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of jesus his son purifies us from all sin if we claim to be without sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness if we claim we have not sinned we make him out to be a liar and his word has no place in our lives my dear children i write this to you so that you will not sin but if anybody does sin we have one who speaks to the father in our defense jesus christ the righteous one he is the atoning sacrifice for our sins and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world we know that we have come to know him if we obey his commands the man who says i know him but does not do what he commands is a liar and the truth is not in him but if anyone obeys his word gods love is truly made complete in him this is how we know we are in him whoever claims to live in him must walk as jesus did dear friends i am not writing you a new command but an old one which you have had since the beginning this old command is the message you have heard yet i am writing you a new command its truth is seen in him and you because the darkness is passing and the true light is already shining anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness whoever loves his brother lives in the light and there is nothing in him to make him stumble but whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks around in the darkness he does not know where he is going because the darkness has blinded him i write to you dear children because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name i write to you fathers because you have known him who is from the beginning i write to you young men because you have overcome the evil one i write to you dear children because you have known the father i write to you fathers because you have known him who is from the beginning i write to you young men because you are strong and the word of god lives in you and you have overcome the evil one do not love the world or anything in the world if anyone loves the world the love of the father is not in him for everything in the world the cravings of sinful man the lust of his eyes and the boasting of what he has and does comes not from the father but from the world the world and its desires pass away but the man who does the will of god lives forever dear children this is the last hour and as you have heard that the antichrist is coming even now many antichrists have come this is how we know it is the last hour they went out from us but they did not really belong to us for if they had belonged to us they would have remained with us but their going showed that none of them belonged to us but you have an anointing from the holy one and all of you know the truth i do not write to you because you do not know the truth but because you do know it and because no lie comes from the truth who is the liar it is the man who denies that jesus is the christ such a man is the antichrist he denies the father and the son no one who denies the son has the father whoever acknowledges the son has the father also see that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you if it does you also will remain in the son and in the father and this is what he promised us even eternal life i am writing these things to you about those who are trying to lead you astray as for you the anointing you received from him remains in you and you do not need anyone to teach you but as his anointing teaches you about all things and as that anointing is real not counterfeit just as it has taught you remain in him and now dear children continue in him so that when he appears we may be confident and unashamed before him at his coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone who does what is right has been born of him how great is the love the father has lavished on us that we should be called children of god and that is what we are the reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him dear friends now we are children of god and what we will be has not yet been made known but we know that when he appears we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is everyone who has this hope in him purifies himself just as he is pure everyone who sins breaks the law in fact sin is lawlessness but you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins and in him is no sin no one who lives in him keeps on sinning no one who continues to sin has either seen him or known him dear children do not let anyone lead you astray he who does what is right is righteous just as he is righteous he who does what is sinful is of the devil because the devil has been sinning from the beginning the reason the son of god appeared was to destroy the devils work no one who is born of god will continue to sin because gods seed remains in him he cannot go on sinning because he has been born of god this is how we know who the children of god are and who the children of the devil are anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of god nor is anyone who does not love his brother this is the message you heard from the beginning we should love one another do not be like cain who belonged to the evil one and murdered his brother and why did he murder him because his own actions were evil and his brothers were righteous do not be surprised my brothers if the world hates you we know that we have passed from death to life because we love our brothers anyone who does not love remains in death anyone who hates his brother is a murderer and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him this is how we know what love is jesus christ laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for our brothers if anyone has material possessions and sees his brother in need but has no pity on him how can the love of god be in him dear children let us not love with words or tongue but with actions and in truth this then is how we know that we belong to the truth and how we set our hearts at rest in his presence whenever our hearts condemn us for god is greater than our hearts and he knows everything dear friends if our hearts do not condemn us we have confidence before god and receive from him anything we ask because we obey his commands and do what pleases him and this is his command to believe in the name of his son jesus christ and to love one another as he commanded us those who obey his commands live in him and he in them and this is how we know that he lives in us we know it by the spirit he gave us dear friends do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world this is how you can recognize the spirit of god every spirit that acknowledges that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god but every spirit that does not acknowledge jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist which you have heard is coming and even now is already in the world you dear children are from god and have overcome them because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world they are from the world and therefore speak from the viewpoint of the world and the world listens to them we are from god and whoever knows god listens to us but whoever is not from god does not listen to us this is how we recognize the spirit of truth and the spirit of falsehood dear friends let us love one another for love comes from god everyone who loves has been born of god and knows god whoever does not love does not know god because god is love this is how god showed his love among us he sent his one and only son into the world that we might live through him this is love not that we loved god but that he loved us and sent his son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins dear friends since god so loved us we also ought to love one another no one has ever seen god but if we love one another god lives in us and his love is made complete in us we know that we live in him and he in us because he has given us of his spirit and we have seen and testify that the father has sent his son to be the savior of the world if anyone acknowledges that jesus is the son of god god lives in him and he in god and so we know and rely on the love god has for us god is love whoever lives in love lives in god and god in him in this way love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment because in this world we are like him there is no fear in love but perfect love drives out fear because fear has to do with punishment the one who fears is not made perfect in love we love because he first loved us if anyone says i love god yet hates his brother he is a liar for anyone who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love god whom he has not seen and he has given us this command whoever loves god must also love his brother everyone who believes that jesus is the christ is born of god and everyone who loves the father loves his child as well this is how we know that we love the children of god by loving god and carrying out his commands this is love for god to obey his commands and his commands are not burdensome for everyone born of god overcomes the world this is the victory that has overcome the world even our faith who is it that overcomes the world only he who believes that jesus is the son of god this is the one who came by water and blood jesus christ he did not come by water only but by water and blood and it is the spirit who testifies because the spirit is the truth for there are three that testify the spirit the water and the blood and the three are in agreement we accept mans testimony but gods testimony is greater because it is the testimony of god which he has given about his son anyone who believes in the son of god has this testimony in his heart anyone who does not believe god has made him out to be a liar because he has not believed the testimony god has given about his son and this is the testimony god has given us eternal life and this life is in his son he who has the son has life he who does not have the son of god does not have life i write these things to you who believe in the name of the son of god so that you may know that you have eternal life this is the confidence we have in approaching god that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us and if we know that he hears us whatever we ask we know that we have what we asked of him if anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death he should pray and god will give him life i refer to those whose sin does not lead to death there is a sin that leads to death i am not saying that he should pray about that all wrongdoing is sin and there is sin that does not lead to death we know that anyone born of god does not continue to sin the one who was born of god keeps him safe and the evil one cannot harm him we know that we are children of god and that the whole world is under the control of the evil one we know also that the son of god has come and has given us understanding so that we may know him who is true and we are in him who is true even in his son jesus christ he is the true god and eternal life dear children keep yourselves from idols  the elder to the chosen lady and her children whom i love in the truth and not i only but also all who know the truth because of the truth which lives in us and will be with us forever grace mercy and peace from god the father and from jesus christ the fathers son will be with us in truth and love it has given me great joy to find some of your children walking in the truth just as the father commanded us and now dear lady i am not writing you a new command but one we have had from the beginning i ask that we love one another and this is love that we walk in obedience to his commands as you have heard from the beginning his command is that you walk in love many deceivers who do not acknowledge jesus christ as coming in the flesh have gone out into the world any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist watch out that you do not lose what you have worked for but that you may be rewarded fully anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of christ does not have god whoever continues in the teaching has both the father and the son if anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching do not take him into your house or welcome him anyone who welcomes him shares in his wicked work i have much to write to you but i do not want to use paper and ink instead i hope to visit you and talk with you face to face so that our joy may be complete the children of your chosen sister send their greetings  the elder to my dear friend gaius whom i love in the truth dear friend i pray that you may enjoy good health and that all may go well with you even as your soul is getting along well it gave me great joy to have some brothers come and tell about your faithfulness to the truth and how you continue to walk in the truth i have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth dear friend you are faithful in what you are doing for the brothers even though they are strangers to you they have told the church about your love you will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of god it was for the sake of the name that they went out receiving no help from the pagans we ought therefore to show hospitality to such men so that we may work together for the truth i wrote to the church but diotrephes who loves to be first will have nothing to do with us so if i come i will call attention to what he is doing gossiping maliciously about us not satisfied with that he refuses to welcome the brothers he also stops those who want to do so and puts them out of the church dear friend do not imitate what is evil but what is good anyone who does what is good is from god anyone who does what is evil has not seen god demetrius is well spoken of by everyone and even by the truth itself we also speak well of him and you know that our testimony is true i have much to write you but i do not want to do so with pen and ink i hope to see you soon and we will talk face to face peace to you the friends here send their greetings greet the friends there by name  jude a servant of jesus christ and a brother of james to those who have been called who are loved by god the father and kept by jesus christ mercy peace and love be yours in abundance dear friends although i was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share i felt i had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints for certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you they are godless men who change the grace of our god into a license for immorality and deny jesus christ our only sovereign and lord though you already know all this i want to remind you that the lord delivered his people out of egypt but later destroyed those who did not believe and the angels who did not keep their positions of authority but abandoned their own home these he has kept in darkness bound with everlasting chains for judgment on the great day in a similar way sodom and gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to sexual immorality and perversion they serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire in the very same way these dreamers pollute their own bodies reject authority and slander celestial beings but even the archangel michael when he was disputing with the devil about the body of moses did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him but said the lord rebuke you yet these men speak abusively against whatever they do not understand and what things they do understand by instinct like unreasoning animals these are the very things that destroy them woe to them they have taken the way of cain they have rushed for profit into balaams error they have been destroyed in korahs rebellion these men are blemishes at your love feasts eating with you without the slightest qualm shepherds who feed only themselves they are clouds without rain blown along by the wind autumn trees without fruit and uprooted twice dead they are wild waves of the sea foaming up their shame wandering stars for whom blackest darkness has been reserved forever enoch the seventh from adam prophesied about these men see the lord is coming with thousands upon thousands of his holy ones to judge everyone and to convict all the ungodly of all the ungodly acts they have done in the ungodly way and of all the harsh words ungodly sinners have spoken against him these men are grumblers and faultfinders they follow their own evil desires they boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage but dear friends remember what the apostles of our lord jesus christ foretold they said to you in the last times there will be scoffers who will follow their own ungodly desires these are the men who divide you who follow mere natural instincts and do not have the spirit but you dear friends build yourselves up in your most holy faith and pray in the holy spirit keep yourselves in gods love as you wait for the mercy of our lord jesus christ to bring you to eternal life be merciful to those who doubt snatch others from the fire and save them to others show mercy mixed with fear hating even the clothing stained by corrupted flesh to him who is able to keep you from falling and to present you before his glorious presence without fault and with great joy to the only god our savior be glory majesty power and authority through jesus christ our lord before all ages now and forevermore amen  the revelation of jesus christ which god gave him to show his servants what must soon take place he made it known by sending his angel to his servant john who testifies to everything he saw that is the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ blessed is the one who reads the words of this prophecy and blessed are those who hear it and take to heart what is written in it because the time is near john to the seven churches in the province of asia grace and peace to you from him who is and who was and who is to come and from the seven spirits before his throne and from jesus christ who is the faithful witness the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth to him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood and has made us to be a kingdom and priests to serve his god and father to him be glory and power for ever and ever amen look he is coming with the clouds and every eye will see him even those who pierced him and all the peoples of the earth will mourn because of him so shall it be amen i am the alpha and the omega says the lord god who is and who was and who is to come the almighty i john your brother and companion in the suffering and kingdom and patient endurance that are ours in jesus was on the island of patmos because of the word of god and the testimony of jesus on the lords day i was in the spirit and i heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet which said write on a scroll what you see and send it to the seven churches to ephesus smyrna pergamum thyatira sardis philadelphia and laodicea i turned around to see the voice that was speaking to me and when i turned i saw seven golden lampstands and among the lampstands was someone like a son of man dressed in a robe reaching down to his feet and with a golden sash around his chest his head and hair were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were like blazing fire his feet were like bronze glowing in a furnace and his voice was like the sound of rushing waters in his right hand he held seven stars and out of his mouth came a sharp double edged sword his face was like the sun shining in all its brilliance when i saw him i fell at his feet as though dead then he placed his right hand on me and said do not be afraid i am the first and the last i am the living one i was dead and behold i am alive for ever and ever and i hold the keys of death and hades write therefore what you have seen what is now and what will take place later the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and of the seven golden lampstands is this the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches to the angel of the church in ephesus write these are the words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand and walks among the seven golden lampstands i know your deeds your hard work and your perseverance i know that you cannot tolerate wicked men that you have tested those who claim to be apostles but are not and have found them false you have persevered and have endured hardships for my name and have not grown weary yet i hold this against you you have forsaken your first love remember the height from which you have fallen repent and do the things you did at first if you do not repent i will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place but you have this in your favor you hate the practices of the nicolaitans which i also hate he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to him who overcomes i will give the right to eat from the tree of life which is in the paradise of god to the angel of the church in smyrna write these are the words of him who is the first and the last who died and came to life again i know your afflictions and your poverty yet you are rich i know the slander of those who say they are jews and are not but are a synagogue of satan do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer i tell you the devil will put some of you in prison to test you and you will suffer persecution for ten days be faithful even to the point of death and i will give you the crown of life he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches he who overcomes will not be hurt at all by the second death to the angel of the church in pergamum write these are the words of him who has the sharp doubleedged sword i know where you live where satan has his throne yet you remain true to my name you did not renounce your faith in me even in the days of antipas my faithful witness who was put to death in your city where satan lives nevertheless i have a few things against you you have people there who hold to the teaching of balaam who taught balak to entice the israelites to sin by eating food sacrificed to idols and by committing sexual immorality likewise you also have those who hold to the teaching of the nicolaitans repent therefore otherwise i will soon come to you and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to him who overcomes i will give some of the hidden manna i will also give him a white stone with a new name written on it known only to him who receives it to the angel of the church in thyatira write these are the words of the son of god whose eyes are like blazing fire and whose feet are like burnished bronze i know your deeds your love and faith your service and perseverance and that you are now doing more than you did at first nevertheless i have this against you you tolerate that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess by her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality and the eating of food sacrificed to idols i have given her time to repent of her immorality but she is unwilling so i will cast her on a bed of suffering and i will make those who commit adultery with her suffer intensely unless they repent of her ways i will strike her children dead then all the churches will know that i am he who searches hearts and minds and i will repay each of you according to your deeds now i say to the rest of you in thyatira to you who do not hold to her teaching and have not learned satans so called deep secrets i will not impose any other burden on you only hold on to what you have until i come to him who overcomes and does my will to the end i will give authority over the nations he will rule them with an iron scepter he will dash them to pieces like pottery just as i have received authority from my father i will also give him the morning star he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to the angel of the church in sardis write these are the words of him who holds the seven spirits of god and the seven stars i know your deeds you have a reputation of being alive but you are dead wake up strengthen what remains and is about to die for i have not found your deeds complete in the sight of my god remember therefore what you have received and heard obey it and repent but if you do not wake up i will come like a thief and you will not know at what time i will come to you yet you have a few people in sardis who have not soiled their clothes they will walk with me dressed in white for they are worthy he who overcomes will like them be dressed in white i will never blot out his name from the book of life but will acknowledge his name before my father and his angels he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to the angel of the church in philadelphia write these are the words of him who is holy and true who holds the key of david what he opens no one can shut and what he shuts no one can open i know your deeds see i have placed before you an open door that no one can shut i know that you have little strength yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name i will make those who are of the synagogue of satan who claim to be jews though they are not but are liars i will make them come and fall down at your feet and acknowledge that i have loved you since you have kept my command to endure patiently i will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth i am coming soon hold on to what you have so that no one will take your crown him who overcomes i will make a pillar in the temple of my god never again will he leave it i will write on him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god the new jerusalem which is coming down out of heaven from my god and i will also write on him my new name he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches to the angel of the church in laodicea write these are the words of the amen the faithful and true witness the ruler of gods creation i know your deeds that you are neither cold nor hot i wish you were either one or the other so because you are lukewarm neither hot nor cold i am about to spit you out of my mouth you say i am rich i have acquired wealth and do not need a thing but you do not realize that you are wretched pitiful poor blind and naked i counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire so you can become rich and white clothes to wear so you can cover your shameful nakedness and salve to put on your eyes so you can see those whom i love i rebuke and discipline so be earnest and repent here i am i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me to him who overcomes i will give the right to sit with me on my throne just as i overcame and sat down with my father on his throne he who has an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches after this i looked and there before me was a door standing open in heaven and the voice i had first heard speaking to me like a trumpet said come up here and i will show you what must take place after this at once i was in the spirit and there before me was a throne in heaven with someone sitting on it and the one who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian a rainbow resembling an emerald encircled the throne surrounding the throne were twenty four other thrones and seated on them were twenty four elders they were dressed in white and had crowns of gold on their heads from the throne came flashes of lightning rumblings and peals of thunder before the throne seven lamps were blazing these are the seven spirits of god also before the throne there was what looked like a sea of glass clear as crystal in the center around the throne were four living creatures and they were covered with eyes in front and in back the first living creature was like a lion the second was like an ox the third had a face like a man the fourth was like a flying eagle each of the four living creatures had six wings and was covered with eyes all around even under his wings day and night they never stop saying holy holy holy is the lord god almighty who was and is and is to come whenever the living creatures give glory honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne and who lives for ever and ever the twenty four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for ever and ever they lay their crowns before the throne and say you are worthy our lord and god to receive glory and honor and power for you created all things and by your will they were created and have their being then i saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a scroll with writing on both sides and sealed with seven seals and i saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll but no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth could open the scroll or even look inside it i wept and wept because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or look inside then one of the elders said to me do not weep see the lion of the tribe of judah the root of david has triumphed he is able to open the scroll and its seven seals then i saw a lamb looking as if it had been slain standing in the center of the throne encircled by the four living creatures and the elders he had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent out into all the earth he came and took the scroll from the right hand of him who sat on the throne and when he had taken it the four living creatures and the twenty four elders fell down before the lamb each one had a harp and they were holding golden bowls full of incense which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song you are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals because you were slain and with your blood you purchased men for god from every tribe and language and people and nation you have made them to be a kingdom and priests to serve our god and they will reign on the earth then i looked and heard the voice of many angels numbering thousands upon thousands and ten thousand times ten thousand they encircled the throne and the living creatures and the elders in a loud voice they sang worthy is the lamb who was slain to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and praise then i heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and all that is in them singing to him who sits on the throne and to the lamb be praise and honor and glory and power for ever and ever the four living creatures said amen and the elders fell down and worshiped i watched as the lamb opened the first of the seven seals then i heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder come i looked and there before me was a white horse its rider held a bow and he was given a crown and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest when the lamb opened the second seal i heard the second living creature say come then another horse came out a fiery red one its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make men slay each other to him was given a large sword when the lamb opened the third seal i heard the third living creature say come i looked and there before me was a black horse its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand then i heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for a days wages and three quarts of barley for a days wages and do not damage the oil and the wine when the lamb opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature say come i looked and there before me was a pale horse its rider was named death and hades was following close behind him they were given power over a fourth of the earth to kill by sword famine and plague and by the wild beasts of the earth when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain because of the word of god and the testimony they had maintained they called out in a loud voice how long sovereign lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood then each of them was given a white robe and they were told to wait a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and brothers who were to be killed as they had been was completed i watched as he opened the sixth seal there was a great earthquake the sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair the whole moon turned blood red and the stars in the sky fell to earth as late figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind the sky receded like a scroll rolling up and every mountain and island was removed from its place then the kings of the earth the princes the generals the rich the mighty and every slave and every free man hid in caves and among the rocks of the mountains they called to the mountains and the rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of their wrath has come and who can stand after this i saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on the land or on the sea or on any tree then i saw another angel coming up from the east having the seal of the living god he called out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm the land and the sea do not harm the land or the sea or the trees until we put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our god then i heard the number of those who were sealed 144000 from all the tribes of israel from the tribe of judah 12000 were sealed from the tribe of reuben 12000 from the tribe of gad 12000 from the tribe of asher 12000 from the tribe of naphtali 12000 from the tribe of manasseh 12000 from the tribe of simeon 12000 from the tribe of levi 12000 from the tribe of issachar 12000 from the tribe of zebulun 12000 from the tribe of joseph 12000 from the tribe of benjamin 12000 after this i looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count from every nation tribe people and language standing before the throne and in front of the lamb they were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands and they cried out in a loud voice salvation belongs to our god who sits on the throne and to the lamb all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures they fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped god saying amen praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our god for ever and ever amen then one of the elders asked me these in white robes who are they and where did they come from i answered sir you know and he said these are they who have come out of the great tribulation they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb therefore they are before the throne of god and serve him day and night in his temple and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them never again will they hunger never again will they thirst the sun will not beat upon them nor any scorching heat for the lamb at the center of the throne will be their shepherd he will lead them to springs of living water and god will wipe away every tear from their eyes when he opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour and i saw the seven angels who stand before god and to them were given seven trumpets another angel who had a golden censer came and stood at the altar he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne the smoke of the incense together with the prayers of the saints went up before god from the angels hand then the angel took the censer filled it with fire from the altar and hurled it on the earth and there came peals of thunder rumblings flashes of lightning and an earthquake then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to sound them the first angel sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood and it was hurled down upon the earth a third of the earth was burned up a third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up the second angel sounded his trumpet and something like a huge mountain all ablaze was thrown into the sea a third of the sea turned into blood a third of the living creatures in the sea died and a third of the ships were destroyed the third angel sounded his trumpet and a great star blazing like a torch fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water the name of the star is wormwood a third of the waters turned bitter and many people died from the waters that had become bitter the fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a third of the sun was struck a third of the moon and a third of the stars so that a third of them turned dark a third of the day was without light and also a third of the night as i watched i heard an eagle that was flying in midair call out in a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabitants of the earth because of the trumpet blasts about to be sounded by the other three angels the fifth angel sounded his trumpet and i saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth the star was given the key to the shaft of the abyss when he opened the abyss smoke rose from it like the smoke from a gigantic furnace the sun and sky were darkened by the smoke from the abyss and out of the smoke locusts came down upon the earth and were given power like that of scorpions of the earth they were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any plant or tree but only those people who did not have the seal of god on their foreheads they were not given power to kill them but only to torture them for five months and the agony they suffered was like that of the sting of a scorpion when it strikes a man during those days men will seek death but will not find it they will long to die but death will elude them the locusts looked like horses prepared for battle on their heads they wore something like crowns of gold and their faces resembled human faces their hair was like womens hair and their teeth were like lions teeth they had breastplates like breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was like the thundering of many horses and chariots rushing into battle they had tails and stings like scorpions and in their tails they had power to torment people for five months they had as king over them the angel of the abyss whose name in hebrew is abaddon and in greek apollyon the first woe is past two other woes are yet to come the sixth angel sounded his trumpet and i heard a voice coming from the horns of the golden altar that is before god it said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet release the four angels who are bound at the great river euphrates and the four angels who had been kept ready for this very hour and day and month and year were released to kill a third of mankind the number of the mounted troops was two hundred million i heard their number the horses and riders i saw in my vision looked like this their breastplates were fiery red dark blue and yellow as sulfur the heads of the horses resembled the heads of lions and out of their mouths came fire smoke and sulfur a third of mankind was killed by the three plagues of fire smoke and sulfur that came out of their mouths the power of the horses was in their mouths and in their tails for their tails were like snakes having heads with which they inflict injury the rest of mankind that were not killed by these plagues still did not repent of the work of their hands they did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold silver bronze stone and wood idols that cannot see or hear or walk nor did they repent of their murders their magic arts their sexual immorality or their thefts then i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven he was robed in a cloud with a rainbow above his head his face was like the sun and his legs were like fiery pillars he was holding a little scroll which lay open in his hand he planted his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land and he gave a loud shout like the roar of a lion when he shouted the voices of the seven thunders spoke and when the seven thunders spoke i was about to write but i heard a voice from heaven say seal up what the seven thunders have said and do not write it down then the angel i had seen standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven and he swore by him who lives for ever and ever who created the heavens and all that is in them the earth and all that is in it and the sea and all that is in it and said there will be no more delay but in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet the mystery of god will be accomplished just as he announced to his servants the prophets then the voice that i had heard from heaven spoke to me once more go take the scroll that lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land so i went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll he said to me take it and eat it it will turn your stomach sour but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey i took the little scroll from the angels hand and ate it it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth but when i had eaten it my stomach turned sour then i was told you must prophesy again about many peoples nations languages and kings i was given a reed like a measuring rod and was told go and measure the temple of god and the altar and count the worshipers there but exclude the outer court do not measure it because it has been given to the gentiles they will trample on the holy city for 42 months and i will give power to my two witnesses and they will prophesy for 1260 days clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the lord of the earth if anyone tries to harm them fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies this is how anyone who wants to harm them must die these men have power to shut up the sky so that it will not rain during the time they are prophesying and they have power to turn the waters into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they want now when they have finished their testimony the beast that comes up from the abyss will attack them and overpower and kill them their bodies will lie in the street of the great city which is figuratively called sodom and egypt where also their lord was crucified for three and a half days men from every people tribe language and nation will gaze on their bodies and refuse them burial the inhabitants of the earth will gloat over them and will celebrate by sending each other gifts because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth but after the three and a half days a breath of life from god entered them and they stood on their feet and terror struck those who saw them then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them come up here and they went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies looked on at that very hour there was a severe earthquake and a tenth of the city collapsed seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake and the survivors were terrified and gave glory to the god of heaven the second woe has passed the third woe is coming soon the seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there were loud voices in heaven which said the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our lord and of his christ and he will reign for ever and ever and the twenty four elders who were seated on their thrones before god fell on their faces and worshiped god saying we give thanks to you lord god almighty the one who is and who was because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign the nations were angry and your wrath has come the time has come for judging the dead and for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name both small and great and for destroying those who destroy the earth then gods temple in heaven was opened and within his temple was seen the ark of his covenant and there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder an earthquake and a great hailstorm a great and wondrous sign appeared in heaven a woman clothed with the sun with the moon under her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head she was pregnant and cried out in pain as she was about to give birth then another sign appeared in heaven an enormous red dragon with seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns on his heads his tail swept a third of the stars out of the sky and flung them to the earth the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that he might devour her child the moment it was born she gave birth to a son a male child who will rule all the nations with an iron scepter and her child was snatched up to god and to his throne the woman fled into the desert to a place prepared for her by god where she might be taken care of for 1260 days and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon and his angels fought back but he was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven the great dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil or satan who leads the whole world astray he was hurled to the earth and his angels with him then i heard a loud voice in heaven say now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our god and the authority of his christ for the accuser of our brothers who accuses them before our god day and night has been hurled down they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death therefore rejoice you heavens and you who dwell in them but woe to the earth and the sea because the devil has gone down to you he is filled with fury because he knows that his time is short when the dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child the woman was given the two wings of a great eagle so that she might fly to the place prepared for her in the desert where she would be taken care of for a time times and half a time out of the serpents reach then from his mouth the serpent spewed water like a river to overtake the woman and sweep her away with the torrent but the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed out of his mouth then the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war against the rest of her offspring those who obey gods commandments and hold to the testimony of jesus and the dragon stood on the shore of the sea and i saw a beast coming out of the sea he had ten horns and seven heads with ten crowns on his horns and on each head a blasphemous name the beast i saw resembled a leopard but had feet like those of a bear and a mouth like that of a lion the dragon gave the beast his power and his throne and great authority one of the heads of the beast seemed to have had a fatal wound but the fatal wound had been healed the whole world was astonished and followed the beast men worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast and they also worshiped the beast and asked who is like the beast who can make war against him the beast was given a mouth to utter proud words and blasphemies and to exercise his authority for forty two months he opened his mouth to blaspheme god and to slander his name and his dwelling place and those who live in heaven he was given power to make war against the saints and to conquer them and he was given authority over every tribe people language and nation all inhabitants of the earth will worship the beast all whose names have not been written in the book of life belonging to the lamb that was slain from the creation of the world he who has an ear let him hear if anyone is to go into captivity into captivity he will go if anyone is to be killed with the sword with the sword he will be killed this calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints then i saw another beast coming out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb but he spoke like a dragon he exercised all the authority of the first beast on his behalf and made the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast whose fatal wound had been healed and he performed great and miraculous signs even causing fire to come down from heaven to earth in full view of men because of the signs he was given power to do on behalf of the first beast he deceived the inhabitants of the earth he ordered them to set up an image in honor of the beast who was wounded by the sword and yet lived he was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed he also forced everyone small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark which is the name of the beast or the number of his name this calls for wisdom if anyone has insight let him calculate the number of the beast for it is mans number his number is 666 then i looked and there before me was the lamb standing on mount zion and with him 144000 who had his name and his fathers name written on their foreheads and i heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder the sound i heard was like that of harpists playing their harps and they sang a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders no one could learn the song except the 144000 who had been redeemed from the earth these are those who did not defile themselves with women for they kept themselves pure they follow the lamb wherever he goes they were purchased from among men and offered as firstfruits to god and the lamb no lie was found in their mouths they are blameless then i saw another angel flying in midair and he had the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth to every nation tribe language and people he said in a loud voice fear god and give him glory because the hour of his judgment has come worship him who made the heavens the earth the sea and the springs of water a second angel followed and said fallen fallen is babylon the great which made all the nations drink the maddening wine of her adulteries a third angel followed them and said in a loud voice if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand he too will drink of the wine of gods fury which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath he will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the lamb and the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever there is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image or for anyone who receives the mark of his name this calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey gods commandments and remain faithful to jesus then i heard a voice from heaven say write blessed are the dead who die in the lord from now onyes says the spirit they will rest from their labor for their deeds will follow them i looked and there before me was a white cloud and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man with a crown of gold on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand then another angel came out of the temple and called in a loud voice to him who was sitting on the cloud take your sickle and reap because the time to reap has come for the harvest of the earth is ripe so he who was seated on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth and the earth was harvested another angel came out of the temple in heaven and he too had a sharp sickle still another angel who had charge of the fire came from the altar and called in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle take your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes from the earths vine because its grapes are ripe the angel swung his sickle on the earth gathered its grapes and threw them into the great winepress of gods wrath they were trampled in the winepress outside the city and blood flowed out of the press rising as high as the horses bridles for a distance of 1600 stadia i saw in heaven another great and marvelous sign seven angels with the seven last plagues last because with them gods wrath is completed and i saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire and standing beside the sea those who had been victorious over the beast and his image and over the number of his name they held harps given them by god and sang the song of moses the servant of god and the song of the lamb great and marvelous are your deeds lord god almighty just and true are your ways king of the ages who will not fear you o lord and bring glory to your name for you alone are holy all nations will come and worship before you for your righteous acts have been revealed after this i looked and in heaven the temple that is the tabernacle of the testimony was opened out of the temple came the seven angels with the seven plagues they were dressed in clean shining linen and wore golden sashes around their chests then one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of god who lives for ever and ever and the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of god and from his power and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed then i heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels go pour out the seven bowls of gods wrath on the earth the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood like that of a dead man and every living thing in the sea died the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water and they became blood then i heard the angel in charge of the waters say you are just in these judgments you who are and who were the holy one because you have so judged for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve and i heard the altar respond yes lord god almighty true and just are your judgments the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire they were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of god who had control over these plagues but they refused to repent and glorify him the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom was plunged into darkness men gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores but they refused to repent of what they had done the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east then i saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs they came out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet they are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs and they go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them for the battle on the great day of god almighty behold i come like a thief blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed then they gathered the kings together to the place that in hebrew is called armageddon the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne saying it is done then there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a severe earthquake no earthquake like it has ever occurred since man has been on earth so tremendous was the quake the great city split into three parts and the cities of the nations collapsed god remembered babylon the great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath every island fled away and the mountains could not be found from the sky huge hailstones of about a hundred pounds each fell upon men and they cursed god on account of the plague of hail because the plague was so terrible one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me come i will show you the punishment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters with her the kings of the earth committed adultery and the inhabitants of the earth were intoxicated with the wine of her adulteries then the angel carried me away in the spirit into a desert there i saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was covered with blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet and was glittering with gold precious stones and pearls she held a golden cup in her hand filled with abominable things and the filth of her adulteries this title was written on her forehead mystery babylon the great the mother of prostitutes and of the abominations of the earth i saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints the blood of those who bore testimony to jesus when i saw her i was greatly astonished then the angel said to me why are you astonished i will explain to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast she rides which has the seven heads and ten horns the beast which you saw once was now is not and will come up out of the abyss and go to his destruction the inhabitants of the earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the creation of the world will be astonished when they see the beast because he once was now is not and yet will come this calls for a mind with wisdom the seven heads are seven hills on which the woman sits they are also seven kings five have fallen one is the other has not yet come but when he does come he must remain for a little while the beast who once was and now is not is an eighth king he belongs to the seven and is going to his destruction the ten horns you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom but who for one hour will receive authority as kings along with the beast they have one purpose and will give their power and authority to the beast they will make war against the lamb but the lamb will overcome them because he is lord of lords and king of kings and with him will be his called chosen and faithful followers then the angel said to me the waters you saw where the prostitute sits are peoples multitudes nations and languages the beast and the ten horns you saw will hate the prostitute they will bring her to ruin and leave her naked they will eat her flesh and burn her with fire for god has put it into their hearts to accomplish his purpose by agreeing to give the beast their power to rule until gods words are fulfilled the woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth after this i saw another angel coming down from heaven he had great authority and the earth was illuminated by his splendor with a mighty voice he shouted fallen fallen is babylon the great she has become a home for demons and a haunt for every evil spirit a haunt for every unclean and detestable bird for all the nations have drunk the maddening wine of her adulteries the kings of the earth committed adultery with her and the merchants of the earth grew rich from her excessive luxuries then i heard another voice from heaven say come out of her my people so that you will not share in her sins so that you will not receive any of her plagues for her sins are piled up to heaven and god has remembered her crimes give back to her as she has given pay her back double for what she has done mix her a double portion from her own cup give her as much torture and grief as the glory and luxury she gave herself in her heart she boasts i sit as queen i am not a widow and i will never mourn therefore in one day her plagues will overtake her death mourning and famine she will be consumed by fire for mighty is the lord god who judges her when the kings of the earth who committed adultery with her and shared her luxury see the smoke of her burning they will weep and mourn over her terrified at her torment they will stand far off and cry woe woe o great city o babylon city of power in one hour your doom has come the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargoes any more cargoes of gold silver precious stones and pearls fine linen purple silk and scarlet cloth every sort of citron wood and articles of every kind made of ivory costly wood bronze iron and marble cargoes of cinnamon and spice of incense myrrh and frankincense of wine and olive oil of fine flour and wheat cattle and sheep horses and carriages and bodies and souls of men they will say the fruit you longed for is gone from you all your riches and splendor have vanished never to be recovered the merchants who sold these things and gained their wealth from her will stand far off terrified at her torment they will weep and mourn and cry out woe woe o great city dressed in fine linen purple and scarlet and glittering with gold precious stones and pearls in one hour such great wealth has been brought to ruin every sea captain and all who travel by ship the sailors and all who earn their living from the sea will stand far off when they see the smoke of her burning they will exclaim was there ever a city like this great city they will throw dust on their heads and with weeping and mourning cry out woe woe o great city where all who had ships on the sea became rich through her wealth in one hour she has been brought to ruin rejoice over her o heaven rejoice saints and apostles and prophets god has judged her for the way she treated you then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a large millstone and threw it into the sea and said with such violence the great city of babylon will be thrown down never to be found again the music of harpists and musicians flute players and trumpeters will never be heard in you again no workman of any trade will ever be found in you again the sound of a millstone will never be heard in you again the light of a lamp will never shine in you again the voice of bridegroom and bride will never be heard in you again your merchants were the worlds great men by your magic spell all the nations were led astray in her was found the blood of prophets and of the saints and of all who have been killed on the earth after this i heard what sounded like the roar of a great multitude in heaven shouting hallelujah salvation and glory and power belong to our god for true and just are his judgments he has condemned the great prostitute who corrupted the earth by her adulteries he has avenged on her the blood of his servants and again they shouted hallelujah the smoke from her goes up for ever and ever the twenty four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped god who was seated on the throne and they cried amen hallelujah then a voice came from the throne saying praise our god all you his servants you who fear him both small and great then i heard what sounded like a great multitude like the roar of rushing waters and like loud peals of thunder shouting hallelujah for our lord god almighty reigns let us rejoice and be glad and give him glory for the wedding of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready fine linen bright and clean was given her to wear fine linen stands for the righteous acts of the saints then the angel said to me write blessed are those who are invited to the wedding supper of the lamb and he added these are the true words of god at this i fell at his feet to worship him but he said to me do not do it i am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who hold to the testimony of jesus worship god for the testimony of jesus is the spirit of prophecy i saw heaven standing open and there before me was a white horse whose rider is called faithful and true with justice he judges and makes war his eyes are like blazing fire and on his head are many crowns he has a name written on him that no one knows but he himself he is dressed in a robe dipped in blood and his name is the word of god the armies of heaven were following him riding on white horses and dressed in fine linen white and clean out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations he will rule them with an iron scepter he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god almighty on his robe and on his thigh he has this name written king of kings and lord of lords and i saw an angel standing in the sun who cried in a loud voice to all the birds flying in midair come gather together for the great supper of god so that you may eat the flesh of kings generals and mighty men of horses and their riders and the flesh of all people free and slave small and great then i saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against the rider on the horse and his army but the beast was captured and with him the false prophet who had performed the miraculous signs on his behalf with these signs he had deluded those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped his image the two of them were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur the rest of them were killed with the sword that came out of the mouth of the rider on the horse and all the birds gorged themselves on their flesh and i saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key to the abyss and holding in his hand a great chain he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil or satan and bound him for a thousand years he threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended after that he must be set free for a short time i saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for jesus and because of the word of god they had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands they came to life and reigned with christ a thousand years the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended this is the first resurrection blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection the second death has no power over them but they will be priests of god and of christ and will reign with him for a thousand years when the thousand years are over satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth gog and magog to gather them for battle in number they are like the sand on the seashore they marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of gods people the city he loves but fire came down from heaven and devoured them and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever then i saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it earth and sky fled from his presence and there was no place for them and i saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened another book was opened which is the book of life the dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them and each person was judged according to what he had done then death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire the lake of fire is the second death if anyones name was not found written in the book of life he was thrown into the lake of fire then i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away and there was no longer any sea i saw the holy city the new jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god prepared as a bride beautifully dressed for her husband and i heard a loud voice from the throne saying now the dwelling of god is with men and he will live with them they will be his people and god himself will be with them and be their god he will wipe every tear from their eyes there will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain for the old order of things has passed away he who was seated on the throne said i am making everything new then he said write this down for these words are trustworthy and true he said to me it is done i am the alpha and the omega the beginning and the end to him who is thirsty i will give to drink without cost from the spring of the water of life he who overcomes will inherit all this and i will be his god and he will be my son but the cowardly the unbelieving the vile the murderers the sexually immoral those who practice magic arts the idolaters and all liars their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur this is the second death one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came and said to me come i will show you the bride the wife of the lamb and he carried me away in the spirit to a mountain great and high and showed me the holy city jerusalem coming down out of heaven from god it shone with the glory of god and its brilliance was like that of a very precious jewel like a jasper clear as crystal it had a great high wall with twelve gates and with twelve angels at the gates on the gates were written the names of the twelve tribes of israel there were three gates on the east three on the north three on the south and three on the west the wall of the city had twelve foundations and on them were the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb the angel who talked with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city its gates and its walls the city was laid out like a square as long as it was wide he measured the city with the rod and found it to be 12000 stadia in length and as wide and high as it is long he measured its wall and it was 144 cubits thick by mans measurement which the angel was using the wall was made of jasper and the city of pure gold as pure as glass the foundations of the city walls were decorated with every kind of precious stone the first foundation was jasper the second sapphire the third chalcedony the fourth emerald the fifth sardonyx the sixth carnelian the seventh chrysolite the eighth beryl the ninth topaz the tenth chrysoprase the eleventh jacinth and the twelfth amethyst the twelve gates were twelve pearls each gate made of a single pearl the great street of the city was of pure gold like transparent glass i did not see a temple in the city because the lord god almighty and the lamb are its temple the city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it for the glory of god gives it light and the lamb is its lamp the nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their splendor into it on no day will its gates ever be shut for there will be no night there the glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it nothing impure will ever enter it nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful but only those whose names are written in the lambs book of life then the angel showed me the river of the water of life as clear as crystal flowing from the throne of god and of the lamb down the middle of the great street of the city on each side of the river stood the tree of life bearing twelve crops of fruit yielding its fruit every month and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations no longer will there be any curse the throne of god and of the lamb will be in the city and his servants will serve him they will see his face and his name will be on their foreheads there will be no more night they will not need the light of a lamp or the light of the sun for the lord god will give them light and they will reign for ever and ever the angel said to me these words are trustworthy and true the lord the god of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel to show his servants the things that must soon take place behold i am coming soon blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book i john am the one who heard and saw these things and when i had heard and seen them i fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing them to me but he said to me do not do it i am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers the prophets and of all who keep the words of this book worship god then he told me do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book because the time is near let him who does wrong continue to do wrong let him who is vile continue to be vile let him who does right continue to do right and let him who is holy continue to be holy behold i am coming soon my reward is with me and i will give to everyone according to what he has done i am the alpha and the omega the first and the last the beginning and the end blessed are those who wash their robes that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city outside are the dogs those who practice magic arts the sexually immoral the murderers the idolaters and everyone who loves and practices falsehood i jesus have sent my angel to give you this testimony for the churches i am the root and the offspring of david and the bright morning star the spirit and the bride say come and let him who hears say come whoever is thirsty let him come and whoever wishes let him take the free gift of the water of life i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to them god will add to him the plagues described in this book and if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city which are described in this book he who testifies to these things says yes i am coming soon amen come lord jesus the grace of the lord jesus be with gods people amen
